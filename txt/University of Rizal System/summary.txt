EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A. Introduction 
 
By virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 9157 enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the Philippines on August 11, 2001, the University of Rizal System 
(URS) was established by integrating the Rizal State College and its extension 
campuses in Angono, Binangonan, Pililla and Rodriguez, the Rizal Polytechnic College 
and its extension campus in Cainta and the Rizal Technological University – Antipolo 
Annex. 
 
The URS primarily offers higher professional and technical instruction and training in 
science and technology and promotes research, extension, and production services, 
advanced studies and specialized training in all fields deemed relevant to the 
development goals of Rizal Province. Likewise, the University adopts public elementary 
and secondary schools to serve as pilot centers for innovative teaching and learning 
strategies and approaches so operated and maintained under the Department of 
Education (DepEd). 
 
As a State University in the field of science and technology, it is committed to produce 
competent and valuable graduates in agriculture, engineering, science and technology, 
culture and arts, teacher and business education through responsive instruction, 
research, extension and production services.   
 
The University Management System was assessed by TUV Rheinland and is 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2015 certified with original 
registration date on January 3, 2019. The University of Rizal System commits to deliver 
excellent products and services to ensure total stakeholders’ satisfaction in instruction, 
research, extension, production and dynamic administrative support and to continuously 
improve its quality management system processes to satisfy all applicable requirements. 
During the CY2020, URS has passed the second ISO survey audit for Morong, Tanay, 
and Rodriguez campuses, the first survey visit for Angono, Binangonan, and Antipolo, 
and held the ISO orientation for Taytay and Cainta. 
 
The governance of the URS is bestowed on the Board of Regents chaired by the 
Commissioner of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Dr. Lilian A. De Las 
Llagas, vice-chaired by the University President Dr. Nancy T. Pascual and other 
members, who are representatives of various sectors in the country. The President 
officiates over the affairs, operations and general administration of the URS with the 
assistance of three designated Vice Presidents (VPs), namely, Dr. Renato F. De Lemon 
- Vice-President for Administration and Finance, Dr. Allan E. Conde - Vice-President for 
Academic Affairs and Dr. Marites M. Rio – Vice-President for Research Development, 
Extension and Production. 
 
For the year 2020, the URS had a total manpower of 1,033, broken down as follows:

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; 
(b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of 
implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

C.   Scope of Audit  
 
The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the University of Rizal 
System for CY 2020. It includes analysis of accounts of the financial statements, review 
of transactions and test of compliance with government rules and regulations. The audit 
was also done to: (a) ascertain the propriety of financial transactions and compliance of 
the University with the prescribed rules and regulations; and (b) verify the level of 
assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements 
(FS). 

 
D.  Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 in view of the following 
noted deficiencies as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report:  

 

1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account with a net book value of 
P410,761,023.04 as of December 31, 2020 were not reliable due to unrecorded 
parcels of land, buildings and structures of several campuses of the University, 
contrary to Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 10 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, International Public Sector 
Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 17 and Section 6.1 (f.2) of COA Circular No. 2015-
002 dated March 9, 2015, thus affecting the correctness and reliability of the said 
account balances.  

 
2. Unserviceable properties costing P14,639,249.96 which no longer qualify as assets 

were still carried in the books because disposal of said properties has not yet been 
undertaken by the University, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 
1445, COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989, and Section 2(b), Chapter 
2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, hence total assets reported as of year-end were 
overstated by the carrying amount of the unserviceable properties and the 
University was deprived of additional income that could have been obtained had 
these properties been sold or negotiated promptly. 

 
3. The Biological Assets account  balance amounting  to P4,704,729.52 at year-end 

was unreliable due to: (a) unrecorded offspring of livestock during the year 
amounting to P117,000.00; (b) improperly classified 3,241 items of the asset; (c) 
non-maintenance of Biological Asset Property Card (BAPC) and non-preparation of 
Quarterly Report on Biological Asset (QRBA) per Appendices 78 and 79 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume II, respectively, resulting in its non-submission; and (d) a net 
variance amounting to P2,631,895.48 between the General Ledger and the Physical 
Inventory Count, contrary to Paragraph 31 of IPSAS 27; and Sections 2 and 11, 
Chapter 11, GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus affecting its fair presentation in the 
financial statements. 

 
4. The Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) balance as of 

year-end, amounting to P296,266,922.22 was unreliable due to: (a) non-preparation 



iv 

 

and submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) of the Corporate 
and Business Affairs (CBA) bank account; and (b) non-adjustments of the 
unreleased checks and stale checks amounting to P8,966,276.50 and P567,218.79, 
respectively, contrary to Section 74 of PD No. 1445; and pertinent provisions of 
Chapters 21, 6 and 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 
5. The accuracy and existence of the reported year-end balance of Inventories in the 

Statement of Financial Position totaling P8,051,576.78 could not be ascertained due 
to: (a) incomplete Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI); (b) Stock 
Card (SC) maintained by the Supply and Property Management Office (SPMO) is 
incomplete; and (c) non-maintenance of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) of the 
Accounting Office, which was inconsistent with Sections 9 and 17, Chapter 8 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus rendering the inventory balance at year-end doubtful 
and affects the fairness of presentation in the financial statements. 
 

For the exceptions cited above, the Audit Team recommended the following courses of 
actions: 
 
1. We reiterated our recommendations that the University President create an 

Appraisal Committee or seek assistance from the Rizal Provincial Government thru 
its Appraisal Committee, to determine the fair value of the unrecorded parcels of 
land, buildings and other structures, which should be considered by the Accountant 
to record said properties at fair value, pursuant to Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 10 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I and IPSAS No. 17.  
 

2. We recommended that the University President: (a) instruct the Inventory 
Committee in coordination with the Campus Directors and Supply Officers, to 
prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) for 
all items of PPE that are considered unserviceable, pursuant to Appendix 74 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume II; (b) direct the Supply and Property Management Office 
Head to institute measures to properly dispose all reported unserviceable properties 
in accordance with the provisions of PD No. 1445 and other existing guidelines on 
disposal of government property; and (c) advise concerned personnel to submit 
copy of IIRUP to Accounting Unit upon completion of the disposal, the said report 
shall be the basis of journal entries through Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) in dropping 
the affected PPE accounts in the books of the University. 

 
3. We recommended that the University President: (a) direct the Accountant to record 

biological assets based on the recognition criteria presented in IPSAS 27 and to 
identify each item of biological asset that needs reclassification, based on 
description provided by Section 2, Chapter 11 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 
effect the necessary adjusting journal entries, if warranted; (b) instruct the Director 
for Production Services to ensure maintenance of updated BAPC of all biological 
assets of the University by the Caretaker or Officer-in-charge and prepare and 
submit regularly copies of the QRBA to Accounting for recording and to the Audit 
Team for audit purposes; (c) direct the Accountant in coordination with the Director 
for Production Services to reconcile their records on biological assets in order to 
eliminate the noted variance and reflect fairly the balance of the Biological Asset 
accounts in the Financial Statements; and (d) instruct the University Production and 
Services Management Committee (UPSMC) to formulate policy on the valuation of 
biological assets consistent with the existing rules and regulations prescribed under 
IPSAS 27. 

 



v 

 

4. We recommended that the University President instruct the Director for Finance 
Services to assign competent personnel to handle the accounting functions for the 
Corporate and Business Affairs or consider integration to the Office of the 
Accountant, the recording of the business affairs transactions of the University. Also, 
we reiterated our recommendations that the University President: (a) direct the 
Accountant or designated staff to prepare lacking Bank Reconciliation Statements of 
the CBA for the months of November and December 2019 and for all the months of 
CY 2020 and submit the same to the Audit Team for review. Henceforth, strictly 
observe the prescribed period in the submission of the monthly BRS, pursuant to 
Section 74 of PD No. 1445 and Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I; and         (b) instruct the Accountant to ensure that the necessary journal 
entries for all book reconciling items and needed year-end adjustments for the CIB-
LCCA, as prescribed by Section 56, Chapter 19 and Section 45, Chapter 6 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, were made for its fair presentation in the Statement of 
Financial Position.  

 
5. We recommended that the University President: (a) direct the duly created Inventory 

Committee to conduct physical count on all items of inventory owned by the 
University and prepare the RPCI and submit the same to the Auditor not later than 
July 31st and January 31st of each year for the first and second semesters, 
respectively, pursuant to provisions of Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM; 
(b) require the SPMO and Accounting Office to maintain complete and updated 
records of Stock Cards and SLCs, respectively, of all items of inventory accounts; 
and (c) direct the SPMO and Accounting Office to investigate and reconcile, any 
variances noted between the actual physical count and records of Stock Cards and 
SLCs. 

 
In addition, the following are the other significant observations and the corresponding 
recommendations: 
 
1. The Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) was not 

submitted to the Audit Team for review, which is inconsistent per instructions in 
Appendix No. 73 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President instruct the 
Inventory Committee and Supply Officers of URS Campuses, respectively, to 
prepare and submit in accordance with the instructions cited in Appendix No. 73 of 
the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, the RPCPPE for reconciliation of the record of 
Accounting and Supply Office and for audit purposes of the Audit Team. 
 

2. Due to NGAs with unexpended balance totaling P8,570,329.39, has been idle in the 
custody of the University for many years now, thus deprived the national 
government of the much needed funds for its various projects and programs, 
contrary to the provisions under Section 10 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 
for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, Items 4.9 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994 and Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 
We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations that Management: (a) require the 
Accountant and the Project Implementers to return the unexpended balance of Due 
to NGAs account to the source agencies in compliance with the provisions of 
Section 10 of GAA of FY 2020, Items 4.9 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994 and GAM for NGAs, Volume I; (b) submit to the Audit Team, for 
audit purposes, the status of project  implementation as of December 31, 2020, with 



vi 

 

supporting documents such as Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or approved 
request for extension of project implementation; and (c) instruct the Director for 
Finance Services to closely monitor the status of all Funds transferred to the 
University. 

 
3. The validity and propriety of the payment of Year-End Assistance to all teaching and 

non-teaching personnel of the University amounting to P3,183,000.00 could not be 
determined due to incomplete documentation to support the same, contrary to 
Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 
 
We recommended that the University President direct officials concerned to submit 
all lacking documents to substantiate the transactions, otherwise said transaction 
shall be suspended in audit. Henceforth, see to it that only claims with proper 
documentation are processed and paid. 
 

4. The University did not implement and maintain a sound internal control system on 
handling collections of its Corporate and Business Affairs (CBA), contrary to the 
pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445, Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 
2009 and GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 
4.1. Collections were not deposited intact daily or the next banking day from 

receipt thereof, contrary to Section 69(1) and (4) of the PD No. 1445, thus may 
expose funds to risk of loss or misapplication. While part of collections was 
used to defray operating expenses, not in accordance with Section 14, 
Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 
We reiterated our prior year’s audit recommendation that the URS President: 
(a) instruct the concerned officials to strictly comply with Section 69(1) and (4) 
of the PD No. 1445 by depositing all his/her collections intact and in full 
amount within the next banking day, or where collections are minimal and 
daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the concerned officials 
shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the 
collections reach P10,000.00, to the Authorized Government Depository Bank; 
(b) direct the CBA Office Head to refrain from using collections to defray 
operational expenses, and whenever a transaction that requires payment in 
cash, strictly observed Section 14 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and (c) instruct 
the Director of Finance Services to closely monitor the activities of CBA Office 
to ensure compliance of the concerned personnel to the abovementioned law, 
rules and regulations. 
 

4.2. Receipt of collection is being done by the CBA personnel not covered by 
fidelity bond, contrary to Section 101 of PD No. 1445 and Section 4.1 of 
Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009, thus the University may 
not be indemnified in the event of losses. 
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President: (a) instruct 
the Director for Finance Services to facilitate the application of Fidelity bond of 
the concerned personnel of the University CBA Office or implement other 
possible alternative solutions such as delegating or transfer of collection and 
deposit function to Campus Cashiers; and (b) ensure that all employees of the 
University whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of 
government funds or property are properly bonded in accordance with Section 



vii 

 

101 of PD No. 1445 and Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated 
August 6, 2009 to provide protection on the URS’ cash resources. 
 

 
4.3. Non-issuance of Official Receipt (OR) on collection from sale of books for 

Laboratory School amounting to P2,956,734.00 was noted, contrary to Section 
68 (1) of PD No. 1445, thus may expose collections to risk of loss 
 
We recommended that the President thru the Director for Finance Service 
instruct all Collecting Officers (COs) receiving payment of any nature in behalf 
of the University shall issue OR to acknowledge receipt thereof, pursuant to 
the provisions of Section 68(1) of PD No. 1445. 

 
5. Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) amounting at least P18,550,769.26 were paid 

despite incomplete documentation, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, the 
Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 
June 14, 2012 and pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules 
and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, hence, the propriety and 
validity of the claims could not be readily ascertained. 

 
We recommended that the University President direct concerned personnel to 
submit immediately all lacking documents for review. Otherwise said transactions 
shall be suspended in audit. Henceforth, process and pay only claims with complete 
documentation pursuant to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, COA Circular No. 2012-
001 dated June 14, 2012 and RA No. 9184 and its revised IRR. 
 

6. Delayed submission of 2,244 DVs or 90% of submitted (DVs) during the CY 2020, 
ranging from one to 360 days, which is contrary to Section 7.2.1 of the Rules and 
Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) as prescribed under Commission on 
Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. Moreover, 23 DVs 
and their supporting documents with a total amount of P1,654,974.39 remain 
unsubmitted as of report date. This hampered the audit of the accounts and 
transactions of the University and the Audit Team’s communication to the 
Management of any deficiencies noted.   
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President: (a) direct the 
University Cashier to immediately submit the DVs enumerated in Annex H, 
otherwise said transactions shall be suspended in audit; (b) instruct the Director for 
Finance Services to ensure that all DVs and their supporting documents are 
submitted to the Auditor within the prescribed period to facilitate timely audit of the 
accounts and transactions of the URS, pursuant to Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA 
prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006; and (c) initiate appropriate action 
when necessary, against the concerned personnel in accordance with Sections 
7.1.1 and 7.1.2 of the same COA Circular. 
 

7. Three Hundred Thirty-Two (332) issued Purchase Orders (POs) and their 
supporting documents for the procurement of supplies, equipment and infrastructure 
materials during the CY 2020 with an aggregate amount of P40,656,458.44 were 
not submitted to the Audit Team for review, within five (5) working days from 
issuance thereof, contrary to COA Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 96-010 dated 
February 12, 2009 and August 15, 1996, respectively. Moreover, 164 of these POs 
with a total amount of P24,743,678.64 were not properly accomplished and have 



viii 

 

inconsistencies which could have been communicated to Management earlier for 
corrective actions. 
 
We recommended that the University President: (a) direct the Supply/Property 
Officer to ensure timely submission of the POs and their supporting documents to 
the Audit Team as prescribed by COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009, to facilitate review of the same so that Management could be notified 
immediately of any noted deficiencies thereon; (b) instruct Supply/Property Officer to 
properly accomplished all POs and ensure that all relevant information required in 
COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996 are completely indicated therein; 
and (c) direct the concerned personnel to provide satisfactory explanation on the 
non-submission of the POs and on  the noted deficiencies. 
 

8. The University Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget (GPB) was not 
updated based on the final agency budget per General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 
CY 2020, contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Philippine Commission on 
Women-National Economic and Development Authority-Department of Budget and 
Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01. Moreover, the 
GAD Fund has unutilized balance amounting to P20,560,000.00 as of year-end due 
to insufficient GAD database maintained and excessive allocation of budget for each 
GAD PAPs, thus objectives for which the funds were provided were not fully 
attained.  
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President: (a) direct the 
University GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to maintain sufficient GAD database 
containing sex disaggregated data and updated gender-related statistics, and 
consider the same in identifying priority gender issues to be addressed during GAD 
planning in accordance with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01;             
(b) instruct concerned University Officials to maximize utilization or attribution of the 
GAD funds through integration of gender perspective in the University programs, 
activities and projects to achieve the desired outcomes for GAD using gender 
analysis tool introduced by appropriate authority, in compliance with the pertinent 
provisions of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular; and (c) direct the Head of the 
University GAD Center to review the reasonableness of budget allocation for each 
seminar/workshop through regular monitoring of actual expenses of each GAD 
activity for possible adjustments, so that other equally gender responsive activities 
may be incorporated in the GPB to make the best use of the fund. In addition, we 
recommended that the University President instruct the GFPS to revise the GPB 
once the GAA has been approved, in compliance with Items 8.8 and 9.2 of the 
PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001, copy furnish the Resident Auditor 
with the revised GPB. 
 

9. Non-withholding of taxes on purchases of goods and services amounting to 
P6,840,533.45, contrary to pertinent Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) regulations, 
thus deprived the national government of the immediate use of the fund amounting 
to P324,856.30.  
 
We recommended that the University President (a) direct the University Accountant 
to require concerned Suppliers to show proof of tax payment due to BIR amounting 
to P324,856.30 for the income and government money payments; and (b) instruct 
the University Accountant to ensure that the required withholding taxes are 
deducted before making any payments to supplier of goods and services and to 



ix 

 

remit the same to the BIR within the prescribed period pursuant to its existing 
regulations.  
 

10. The disallowed prior year transactions of the University amounting to 
P11,475,610.67 which became final and executory was not recognized in the books 
of account, contrary to Section 46, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
hence, understate the related receivable and equity accounts by the same amount. 
 
We recommended that the President direct the Accountant to prepare a Journal 
Entry Voucher (JEV) to take up the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges and credit 
the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account for the total amount of the disallowance, 
pursuant to Section 46, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 
 

 
E. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 

 
Of the 29 audit recommendations contained in the 2019 and prior year’s Annual Audit 
Report, six were fully implemented, ten were partially implemented and 13 were not 
implemented by the University.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 
 
Dr. NANCY T. PASCUAL 
President 
University of Rizal System 
Morong, Rizal 
 
 
Qualified Opinion 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the University of Rizal 
System, Morong, Rizal which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as of 
December 31, 2020 and the Statements of Financial Performance, Cash Flows, 
Changes in Net Assets/Equity and Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the 
year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information. 
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Bases for Qualified 
Opinion paragraphs, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the University of Rizal System as of December 31, 2020 and of its 
financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 
 
Bases for Qualified Opinion 
 
As discussed in Part II of this Report, the significant observations include the following 
audit findings which affected the fair presentation of some accounts in the financial 
statements:  

 

1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account with a net book value of 
P410,761,023.04 as of December 31, 2020 were not reliable due to unrecorded 
parcels of land, buildings and structures of several campuses of the University, 
contrary to Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 10 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, IPSAS 17 and Section 6.1 
(f.2) of COA Circular No. 2015-002 dated March 9, 2015, thus affecting the 
correctness and reliability of the said account balances;     

 

2. Unserviceable properties costing P14,639,249.96 which no longer qualify as assets 
were still carried in the books because disposal of said properties has not yet been 
undertaken by the University, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 
1445, COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989, and Section 2 (b), Chapter 

 



 

 
 

2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, hence total assets reported as of year-end were 
overstated by the carrying amount of the unserviceable properties and the 
University was deprived of additional income that could have been obtained had 
these properties been sold or negotiated promptly; 
 

3. The Biological Assets account  balance amounting  to P4,704,729.52 at year-end 
was unreliable due to: (a) unrecorded offspring of livestock during the year 
amounting to P117,000.00; (b) improperly classified 3,241 items of the asset; (c) 
non-maintenance of Biological Asset Property Card (BAPC) and non-preparation of 
Quarterly Report on Biological Asset (QRBA) per Appendices 78 and 79 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume II, respectively, resulting in its non-submission; and (d) a net 
variance amounting to P2,631,895.48 between the General Ledger and the Physical 
Inventory Count, contrary to Paragraph 31 of IPSAS 27; and Sections 2 and 11, 
Chapter 11, GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus affecting its fair presentation in the 
financial statements; 

 
4. The Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) balance as of 

year-end, amounting to P296,266,922.22 was unreliable due to: (a) non-preparation 
and submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) of the Corporate 
and Business Affairs (CBA) bank account; and (b) non-adjustments of the 
unreleased checks and stale checks amounting to P8,966,276.50 and P567,218.79, 
respectively, contrary to Section 74 of PD No. 1445; and pertinent provisions of 
Chapters 21, 6 and 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 
5. The accuracy and existence of the reported year-end balance of Inventories in the 

Statement of Financial Position totaling P8,051,576.78 could not be ascertained due 
to: (a) incomplete Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI); (b) Stock 
Card (SC) maintained by the Supply and Property Management Office (SPMO) is 
incomplete; and (c) non-maintenance of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) of the 
Accounting Office, which was inconsistent with Sections 9 and 17, Chapter 8 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus rendering the inventory balance at year-end doubtful 
and affects the fairness of presentation in the financial statements. 

 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the Revised Code of 
Conduct and Ethical Standards for Commission on Audit Officials (Code of Ethics) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
qualified opinion.    
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Except for the matter described in the Bases for Qualified Opinion section, we have 
determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report. 
 
 



 

 
 

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 
statements in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for 
such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud 
or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  

 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material, if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these financial statements.

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements  
 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with 
the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) adopted by the 
Commission on Audit (COA) per COA Resolution No. 2020-001 dated January 9, 
2020. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless 
stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.  

 
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1 Basis of Accounting 
 
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with the 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).  
 

3.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, deposits 
on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or 
less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to 
insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the consolidated 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
 

3.3 Inventories 
 
Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory 
was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal 
cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 
 

3.4 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 

Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets the 
characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 
 

 tangible items; 
 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental 
to others, or for administrative purposes; and 

 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 
 



23 

 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:   
 

 It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the item will flow to the entity; and 
 

 The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 
Measurement at Recognition 
 
An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. 
 
A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value 
as at the date of acquisition. 
 
The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through 
non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.  
 
Cost includes the following: 
 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 
 

 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 
 

 initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity 
incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having 
used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to 
produce inventories during that period. 
 

Measurement After Recognition 
 
After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  
 
When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be 
replaced at intervals, the URS recognizes such parts as individual assets with 
specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major 
repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the 
plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.  
 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or 
deficit as incurred.  
 
Depreciation 
 
Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is 
significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 



24 

 

 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in 
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.   
 
For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one 
month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  
However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation 
is for the succeeding month. 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is 
more appropriate for agency operation. 

 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The University of Rizal System uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of 
PPE by classification prepared by COA. 
 
The University of Rizal System uses a residual value equivalent to at least five 
percent of the cost of the PPE. 
 
Impairment  
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 
recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable service amount. 
 
Derecognition 
 
The University of Rizal System derecognizes items of property, plant and 
equipment and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized. 
 

3.5 Changes in Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
The University of Rizal System recognizes the effects of changes in accounting 
policy retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied 
prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 

 



25 

 

The University of Rizal System recognizes the effects of changes in accounting 
estimates prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 

 
The University of Rizal System correct material prior period errors 
retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after 
their discovery by: 

 

 Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 
the error occurred; or 
  

 If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating 
the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the 
earliest prior period presented. 

 
3.6 Revenue from Non-exchange Transactions 

 
Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in-
kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an asset if the 
following criteria were met: 
 

 It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 
 

 The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 
An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at 
its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 

 
Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset 
is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized 
in respect of the same inflow. 

 
As University of Rizal System satisfies a present obligation recognized as a 
liability in respect of an inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction 
recognized as an asset, it reduces the carrying amount of the liability recognized 
and recognize an amount of revenue equal to that reduction. 

 
Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

 
Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the 
increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding liability 
is recognized. 

 
 
 



26 

 

Gifts and Donations 
 

The University of Rizal System recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and 
donations when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service 
potential will flow to the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured 
reliably. 

 
Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, or 
there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind were 
received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If 
conditions were attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and revenue 
recognized as the conditions were satisfied. 

 
On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were 
measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained 
by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of the value of an 
asset is normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds 
a recognized and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair 
value were ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid 
market. 

 
3.7 Revenue from Exchange transactions 

 
Measurement of Revenue 

 
Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. 

 
Sale of Goods 

 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of 
the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is 
probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the 
transaction will flow to the University of Rizal System. 

 
Rental Income 

 
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in 
revenue.  

 
3.8 Budget Information 

 
The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the 
government website.  
 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) 
was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared 
on comparable basis.  The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final 



27 

 

budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget.   Explanatory 
comments are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements. 
 
These budget figures were those approved by the governing body both at the 
beginning and during the year following a period of consultation with the public. 
 

3.9 Employee Benefits 
 
The employees of University of Rizal System are member of the Government 
Service Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance 
coverage.  
 
The University of Rizal System recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-
term employee benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as 
expense unless capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 
 
The University of Rizal System recognizes expenses for accumulating 
compensated absences when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal 
leave benefits). Unused entitlements that have accumulated at the reporting date 
were not recognized as expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like 
special leave privileges, were not recognized. 

 
4. Changes in Accounting Policies 

 
University of Rizal System adopted the following new accounting policies: 
 
4.1 In January, 2016, University of Rizal System adopted the IPSAS 12. The new 

standard includes the requirement for recognition of tangible items with 
estimated service life of more than one year not within the capitalization 
threshold of P15,000.00 and is effective for years beginning on or after January, 
2016.  This accounting change had significant impact on University of Rizal 
System’s financial statements.

University because of the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic in the overall operation of 
the University. The decrease in “School Fees” account is due to change of the school

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
A.  Financial and Compliance Audit 
    
1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account with a net book value of 

P410,761,023.04 as of December 31, 2020 was not reliable due to unrecorded 
parcels of land, buildings and structures of several campuses of the 
University, contrary to Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 10 of Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 
I, International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 17 and Section 6.1 
(f.2) of COA Circular No. 2015-002 dated March 9, 2015, thus affecting the 
correctness and reliability of the said account balances. Likewise, the Report 
on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) was not 
submitted to the Audit Team for review, which is inconsistent per instructions 
in Appendix No. 73 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 

 
Section 3, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides: 

 
“Criteria for recognition – The cost of an item of PPE shall be 
recognized as assets if, and only if: 

 
a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service 

potential associated with the item will flow to the entity;  
 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
 

c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the 
government; 

 
d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 

 
e. it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000. 

 
Under this recognition principle, an entity shall evaluate all its 
PPE costs at the time they are incurred. These costs include 
cost incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of PPE and 
costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service 
the PPE.” 

 
While, Section 5 of the same Manual states that “Measurement at Recognition. PPE 
that qualifies for recognition as an asset shall be measured at cost. However, where 
the PPE is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, its cost shall be measured 
at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.” (underscoring supplied) 

 
Also, IPSAS 17 prescribes the recording and measurement of all PPE), as follows: 

 
Recognition: 

 
14. The cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment shall 

be recognized as an asset if, and only if: 



 
43 

 
 

 
(a) It is probable that future economic benefits or service 

potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and 
 
(b) The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 

 
Measurement at Recognition: 

 
26. An item of property, plant, and equipment that qualifies for 

recognition as an asset shall be measured at its cost; and 
 

27. Where an asset is acquired through a non-exchange 
transaction, its cost shall be measured at its fair value as at 
the date of acquisition.” 

 
Section 6.1 (f.2) of COA Circular No. 2015-002 dated March 2015 on Property, 
Plant and Equipment controlled but not owned by entity provides: 

 
a. “An entity shall, in accordance with IPSAS No.17, recognize 

the cost and the related accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses of existing PPE which were not previously 
recognized due to absence of ownership/title based on 
contract, memorandum of agreements and other reasons. 
 

b. If no documents are available, an entity shall recognize the 
cost of the PPE based on fair value as of:  (a) the date of the 
acquisition, if available, or (b) January 1, 2014, or (c) at the 
date the fair value was determined.” 

 
Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II provides format and instructions on 
the use of the RPCPPE and its yearly preparation and submission to the Auditor 
concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year. 

 
The Land account of the University of Rizal (URS) as of December 31, 2020 
showed a balance of P30,289,430.00. Verification of the recorded balance 
disclosed that this account pertains to parcels of land in Pililla, Montalban and 
Tanay campuses, based on the data gathered from the SPMO records, as follows:

Tanay Patent  924,455 27,733,650.00 M-002 
   Total P30,289,430.00  
 
While, lands occupied by the other seven URS campuses in the Municipalities of 
Angono, Binangonan, Cainta, Cardona, Morong, Taytay and Antipolo City remain 
unrecorded as of reporting date. Hence, understates the Land and Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) account by undetermined amount.  

 



 
44 

 
 

Management’s actions in securing land title for its seven campuses since 2009 still 
did not prosper up to this date, the same with its effort to obtain Deed of Donation 
from the Local Government Units (LGUs) where the campuses located. Relative 
thereto, the University Management is encourage to visit the provisions of DENR 
Administrative Order No. 2015-01 dated March 4, 2015, entitled “Guidelines for the 
Processing and Issuance of Special Patents for Public School Sites Under Republic 
Act No. 10023”, and consult with the Provincial Environment Natural Resources 
Office (PENRO) for proper guidance. 
 
Likewise, the following recorded balance of Buildings and Other Structures account 
as of year-end is also understated by undetermined amount of unrecorded 
properties of the URS:

 Total  P387,500,783.58 P147,492,071.90 P240,008,711.68  

 
In an ocular inspection conducted on infrastructure projects in Morong, Tanay, 
Pililla, Taytay and Antipolo campuses revealed that there are buildings and other 
structures which are not included in the Accounting books as of reporting date due 
to lack of relevant documents as basis for recording the same. These unrecorded 
properties, are either fixed assets transferred to the University by virtue of Republic 
Act No. 9157, “An Act Establishing the University of Rizal System by Integrating the 
Existing State Colleges in the Province of Rizal and the Rizal Technological 
University – Antipolo Annex”, or infrastructures funded by the LGUs, such as the 
three-storey Ynares College of Engineering building in Antipolo campus. The school 
building was supposed to be acquired thru donation from the Provincial Government 
of Rizal, but as of reporting date no Deed of Donation was secured by the URS. 
Further inquiry disclosed that the building was constructed by the said LGU and the 
University was only granted the usufructuary right for an undetermined period. 
 
The following are the buildings and other structures in various University campuses 
that remain unrecorded in the books of accounts as of reporting date:

The non-recording of Land, Buildings and Other Structures of various campuses 
affected the fair presentation of the PPE, Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts and 
the corresponding Depreciation Expenses and Accumulated Depreciation accounts 
(for buildings and other structures) in the financial statements. 
 
It is the fair value of the assets that need to be established in order to record the 
related assets, based on the above-mentioned criteria. Fair value as defined in 
Section 2, Chapter 5 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, is the amount for which an 
asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing 
parties in an arm’s length transaction.   
 
On the other hand, the University Inventory Committee’s action is the same with last 
CY 2019. They conducted physical inventory of items of PPE as of year-end, but 
again failed to prepare and submit the RPCPPE to the Audit Team for review up to 
this date, in violation of the provisions cited in Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume II thus, any noted discrepancy between the actual physical count and 
records that needs immediate action cannot be done. 

 
This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation due to failure of the URS 
Management to fully implement the audit recommendations. Thus, the reported 
balances of PPE accounts as of December 31, 2020 are still inaccurate and 
unreliable. 
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President: 

 
a. create an Appraisal Committee or seek assistance from the Rizal 

Provincial Government thru its Appraisal Committee, to determine the fair 
value of the unrecorded parcels of land, buildings and other structures, 
which should be considered by the Accountant to record said properties 
at fair value, pursuant to Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I and IPSAS No. 17; and 

 



 
46 

 
 

b. instruct the Inventory Committee and Supply Officers of URS campuses, 
respectively, to prepare and submit in accordance with the instructions 
cited in Appendix No. 73 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, the RPCPPE for 
reconciliation of the record of Accounting and Supply Office and for audit 
purposes of the Audit Team. 

 
Management’s Comment: 

 
During the exit conference Management informed the Audit Team that the RPCPPE 
was already prepared but the same were not yet finalized and were routed to 
different offices for signature of appropriate authorities. While the duly created 
Appraisal Committee was not able to appraise all items of the unrecorded PPE and 
accounted only four items of these properties. These were already recorded by the 
Accounting Office in the books of accounts on prior years. Management committed 
to adhere fully on the above audit recommendations. 
 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will strictly monitor Management’s compliance. 

 
2. Unserviceable properties costing P14,639,249.96 which no longer qualify as 

assets were still carried in the books because disposal of said properties has 
not yet been undertaken by the University, contrary to Section 79 of 
Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 
1989, and Section 2(b), Chapter 2 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, hence total assets 
reported as of year-end were overstated by the carrying amount of the 
unserviceable properties and the University was deprived of additional 
income that could have been obtained had these properties been sold or 
negotiated promptly. 
 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as Government Auditing Code of the 
Philippines, provides: 
 

“When government property has become unserviceable for any 
cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 
officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the 
agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the 
auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it 
may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may 
be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the 
supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in 
the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 
representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed 
notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive 
days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of 
the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by 
notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the 
locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public 
auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such 



 
47 

 
 

price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned 
and approved by the Commission.” 

 
Also, Section 7 COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989 states: 

 
“In all modes or instances of disposal of government property or 
assets as herein above contemplated, the proceedings shall be 
undertaken by the appropriate authority in the presence of the 
Auditor or other COA representative who shall act as an intelligent, 
responsive and articulate witness thereto. The said act of 
witnessing shall not be confined merely to seeing what is being 
done during the proceedings but shall be related to the more 
meaningful discharge by the Auditor of his/her constitutional duty 
to examine, audit and settle all accounts pertaining to the 
expenditures or uses of government funds and property. Thus, the 
Auditor acting as such witness may verbally advise the agency 
head or his duly authorized representative of any objectionable 
feature/s of the proceedings.xxx” 

 
The Audit Team noted during review of the Report on the Physical Count of 
Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2018, various items 
of unserviceable properties costing P14,639,249.96 (Annex A) which are no longer 
qualify as asset are still carried in the books of the University. The Audit Team could 
not determine if these unserviceable properties are still included in the December 
31, 2020 and 2019 Property Records, because no RPCPPE has been prepared and 
submitted by the Inventory Committee for these reporting dates. However, 
verification of records disclosed that these unserviceable properties remained in the 
books as of December 31, 2020 and the Audit Team have not received from 
management, request for inspection of properties for disposal during the CYs 2020 
and 2019. 

 
Below is a summary of the unserviceable properties as of December 31, 2020:

 Total P14,639,249.96  P13,170,354.64 P1,468,895.32 

 
Section 2(b), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I define assets as resources 
controlled by an entity as a result of past events, and from which future economic 



 
48 

 
 

benefits or service potential are expected to flow to the entity. The above properties 
are no longer qualified as an asset since it has no longer service potentials due to 
damage or obsolescence, hence, must be dropped from the books of the University. 
The Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) should be 
used in reporting the unserviceable properties of the University, pursuant to 
Appendix 74 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 

 
Prolonged custody of these unserviceable properties will result to its further 
deterioration due to its continuous exposure to natural elements and loss of 
possible additional income. The foregoing also overstates the reported carrying 
value of the PPE accounts as of year-end. 

 
We recommended that the University President: 

 
a. instruct the Inventory Committee in coordination with the Campus 

Directors and Supply Officers, to prepare the Inventory and Inspection 
Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) for all items of PPE that are 
considered unserviceable, pursuant to Appendix 74 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume II; 

 
b. direct the Supply and Property Management Office Head to institute 

measures to properly dispose all reported unserviceable properties in 
accordance with the provisions of PD No. 1445 and other existing 
guidelines on disposal of government property; and  

 
c. advise concerned personnel to submit copy of IIRUP to Accounting Unit 

upon completion of the disposal, the said report shall be the basis of 
journal entries through Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) in dropping the 
affected PPE accounts in the books of the University. 

 
Management’s Comment: 

 
According to Supply and Property Management Office (SPMO) during the exit 
conference, the IIRUP was already prepared and all items of unserviceable 
properties were placed in their central storage in URS Tanay Campus, awaiting 
disposal. Management committed that the above noted unserviceable properties will 
be disposed of within the CY 2021. 

 
Audit Team Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will strictly monitor Management’s compliance. 

 
3. The Biological Assets account  balance amounting  to P4,704,729.52 at year-

end was unreliable due to: (a) unrecorded offspring of livestock during the 
year amounting to P117,000.00; (b) improperly classified 3,241 items of the 
asset; (c) non-maintenance of Biological Asset Property Card (BAPC)  and 
non-preparation of Quarterly Report on Biological Asset (QRBA) per 
Appendices 78 and 79 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies, Volume II, respectively, resulting in its non-
submission; and (d) a net variance amounting to P2,631,895.48 between the 
General Ledger and the Physical Inventory Count, contrary to Paragraph 31 of 



 
49 

 
 

International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 27; and Sections 2 
and 11, Chapter 11, GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus affecting its fair 
presentation in the financial statements. 
 
Paragraph 31 of IPSAS 27, provides guidelines in the recognition of gains and 
losses arising on initial recognition of biological assets: 

 
“A loss may arise on initial recognition of a biological asset, 
because costs to sell are deducted in determining fair value less 
costs to sell of a biological asset. A gain may arise on initial 
recognition of a biological asset, such as when a calf is 
born”.(underscoring supplied) 

 
Analysis of the Livestock Held for Consumption/Sale/Distribution account disclosed 
that no gain was recognized during the year, despite of increase in quantity of 
livestock through growth as reflected in the physical inventory report, which resulted 
in the understatement of the related asset and income account. 

 
Records from Production Unit showed that a total of 41 heads of swine and goat 
were born during the year amounting to P117,000.00, but no journal entry was 
made to recognize the asset and gain, as required under the above accounting 
standards. 

 

Livestock Quantity Price/Unit Total 

1. Swine       

a. Boar 1 2,800.00 P2,800.00  

b. Weaners 9 2,800.00    25,200.00  

c. Piglets 28 2,800.00    78,400.00  
       

2. Goat      

a. Buck 1 7,000.00      7,000.00  

b. Kid 2 1,800.00      3,600.00  

Total 41   P117,000.00  

 
Moreover, 3,241 items of the Biological Assets account amounting to P5,764,125.00 
(Annex B) were misclassified as Consumable Biological Assets, such as orchards 
that are fruit bearing trees that should have been classified as Bearer Biological 
Assets, which affects its fair presentation in the financial statements. Consumable 
and Bearer Biological Assets were defined in Section 2.c and f, of Chapter 11, 
Volume I of GAM for NGAs, as follows: 

 
“c. Bearer Biological Assets - are those biological assets that are 
used repeatedly or continuously for more than one year in an 
agricultural activity. Bearer biological assets are not agricultural 
produce but, rather, are self-regenerating. Example, livestock 
from which milk is produced, grape vines, fruit trees, and trees 
from which firewood is harvested while the tree remains. (Par. 
40, IPSAS 27) 

 



 
50 

 
 

f. Consumable Biological Assets – are those that are held for harvest 
as agricultural produce or for sale or distribution at no charge or for a 
nominal charge as biological assets. Examples of consumable 
biological assets are animals and plants for one-time use such as 
livestock intended for the production of meat, livestock held for sale, 
fish in farms, crops such as maize and wheat, and trees being grown 
for lumber.” (underscoring ours) 
 

The Audit Team also observed that the Caretakers or Officer-in-Charge for each 
type of biological asset did not maintain Biological Asset Property Card (BAPC) per 
Appendix 78 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II, thus encounter difficulty in reconciling 
variances between controlling account and the physical inventory due to the 
absence of detailed information for each class or type of biological asset. 
 
It was also reported that BAPC was not maintained by the Property Officer of the 
University. Moreover, the Quarterly Report on Biological Asset (QRBA) per 
Appendix 79 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II was not prepared and unsubmitted to the 
Audit Team, contrary to Section 11, Chapter 11 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which 
provides that a QRBA shall be prepared and submitted containing, among others, 
the balances at beginning of the quarter and the changes in fair value of the 
biological assets due to physical changes such as: a) growth, b) degeneration, c) 
production, and d) procreation. This report shall be the basis of the Accountant to 
recognize gain or loss on fair value of the biological assets. The original copy of the 
report should have been submitted to the Audit Team thru the Accountant in 
accordance with the instructions in the said Appendix 79. The absence of these 
cards/reports has casted doubts on the accuracy, existence and valuation of the 
recorded biological assets at year-end. 

 
Lastly, comparison of the balances of the General Ledger as of year-end and the 
result of physical count disclosed a net variance of P2,631,895.48, shown below: 

 

As of December 31, 2020 

Biological Assets Per GL 
Per Physical 

Inventory 
Count 

Variance 

 Livestock  P    1,105,804.52  P      607,500.00  P       498,304.52  

 Trees, Plants and Crops      3,598,925.00  6,729,125.00  (3,130,200.00) 

 Total P    4,704,729.52  P   7,336,625.00  P (2,631,895.48) 

 
The Audit Team noted that without the detailed information that can be derived from 
BAPC and QRBA for each class or type of biological assets owned by the 
University, the discrepancy will always exist every reporting period date. Moreover, 
no information was disclosed to the Audit Team on the valuation method used by 
Management on its inventory report.  

 
We recommended that the University President: 

 
a. direct the Accountant to record biological assets based on the 

recognition criteria presented in IPSAS 27 and to analyze the Biological 
Assets or identify each item of biological asset that needs 



 
51 

 
 

reclassification, based on description provided by Section 2, Chapter 11 
of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and effect the necessary adjusting journal 
entries, if warranted; 

 
b. instruct the Director for Production Services to ensure maintenance of 

updated BAPC of all biological assets of the University by the Caretaker 
or Officer-in-charge and prepare and submit regularly copies of the QRBA 
to Accounting for recording and to the Audit Team for audit purposes; 

 
c. direct the Accountant in coordination with the Director for Production 

Services to reconcile their records on biological assets in order to 
eliminate the noted variance and reflect fairly the balance of the 
Biological Asset accounts in the Financial Statements; and 

 
d. instruct the University Production and Services Management Committee 

(UPSMC) to formulate policy on the valuation of biological assets 
consistent with the existing rules and regulations prescribed under IPSAS 
27. 

 
Management’s Comment: 

 
Effective January 2021, Biological Asset Property Card (BAPC) – Appendix 78 will 
be maintained by the Project In-charge. The Quarterly Report on Biological Asset 
(QRBA) – Appendix 79 will be submitted to the Accounting Office on or before the 
5th day of the following month. 

 
A University Production and Services Management Committee (UPSMC) shall be 
created through an Office Order. One of its tasks is to formulate policy on the 
valuation of biological assets as prescribed under IPSAS 27. 
 
Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) were prepared by the Accountant to recognize the 
offspring of livestock for CY 2020 (JEV No. 073-21-01-0006D) and the 
reclassification of accounts and adjustments to recognize ending balance per 
physical count as of December 31, 2020 of the Biological Asset account (JEV No. 
062-21-01-0012B). 
 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will strictly monitor Management’s compliance. 

 
4. The Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) balance as 

of year-end, amounting to P296,266,922.22 was unreliable due to: (a) non-
preparation and submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) 
of the Corporate and Business Affairs (CBA) bank account; and (b) non-
adjustments of unreleased checks and stale checks amounting to 
P8,966,276.50 and P567,218.79, respectively, contrary to Section 74 of 
Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445; and pertinent provisions of Chapters 21, 6 
and 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 
Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.

Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that “At the close of each month, depositories 
shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the 
agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that 
reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance 
found in the books of the agency.”  

 
Likewise, Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of GAM, Volume I, provides: 

 
“Section 5 - The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten 
days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with 
the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit 
Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and 
prepare the BRS in four copies.” 

 
“Section 7 - The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty 
days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following: 

 
Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and 

JEVs) 
Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity 
Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file 
Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary” 

 
Section 56, Chapter 19 of the same Manual states:  
 

“A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by 
the Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All 
unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the 
cash accounts. A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration 
of the cash equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of 
the appropriate liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the 
restoration of the unreleased check to the cash account shall be a 
debit to “Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current” account with credit to 
the appropriate liability account. There shall be no physical 
cancellation of the checks. The JEV supporting such restoration shall 
form part of the supporting document to the financial statements to be 
submitted to COA at year end. At the start of the ensuing year, 
another JEV shall be drawn to reverse the previous entry made and 
recognize the availability of the checks for release. This procedure 
shall not apply to account “Cash-Modified Disbursement System 
(MDS)” since there is no actual cash with the GSBs.” 

 
Also, Section 45, Chapter 6 of the Manual prescribes the proper accounting 
treatment for cancelled checks, which includes stale, voided or spoiled. Illustrative 
accounting entries to recognize the cancellation and replacement of the stale, 
voided or spoiled Modified Disbursement System (MDS) and commercial checks 
are as follows:

The same with the previous year’s audit observation, the Management failed anew, 
to prepare and submit monthly BRS of the CBA for all the months of CY 2020 to the 
Audit Team, despite constant follow-ups and demand. Its continuous non-
preparation and submission to the Audit Team prevented the review and verification 
of the accuracy of the reported Cash in Bank balance of the CBA, hence rendered 
the total CIB-LCCA balance reflected in the financial statements doubtful.  
 
Inquiry revealed that the former staff of CBA Office tasked to do the accounting 
works was transferred to other department and her replacement is not equipped to 
handle the tasks. Records show that the latest BRS submitted from the CBA is for 
the month of October 2019, leaving the CIB-LCCA balances for the months of 
November, December 2019 and all the months of CY 2020 not reconciled, contrary 
to the above cited regulations.  
 
Further, review of the submitted BRS for the other bank accounts disclosed that the 
outstanding checks include 399 unreleased checks (Annex C) and 27 stale checks 
(Annex D) amounting to P8,966,276.50 and P567,218.79, respectively, which 
should have been adjusted at year-end as prescribed by the above provisions of 
Chapters 6 and 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  
 
The foregoing observation affects the fair presentation of the respective accounts 
reported in the Statement of Financial Position. 
 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Director for 
Finance Services to assign competent personnel to handle the accounting 
functions for the Corporate and Business Affairs or consider integration to 
the Office of the Accountant, the recording of the business affairs 
transactions of the University. 
 



 
54 

 
 

Also, we reiterated our recommendations that the University President:  
 
a. direct the Accountant or designated staff to prepare lacking Bank 

Reconciliation Statements of the CBA for the months of November and 
December 2019 and for all the months of CY 2020 and submit the same to 
the Auditor for review. Henceforth, strictly observe the prescribed period 
in the submission of the monthly BRS, pursuant to Section 74 of PD No. 
1445 and Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 
and  

 
b. instruct the Accountant to ensure that the necessary journal entries for all 

book reconciling items and needed year-end adjustments for the CIB-
LCCA, as prescribed by Section 56, Chapter 19 and Section 45, Chapter 6 
of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, were made for its fair presentation in the 
Statement of Financial Position.  
 

Management’s Comment: 
  

For future transactions, journal entries will be prepared to recognize the reversion of 
unreleased checks to cash accounts at year-end. Cashier will be advised to prepare 
the Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks as basis of the accounting unit in 
preparation of Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs). 

 
JEVs were prepared to recognize the cancellation of stale MDS/commercial checks 
as of December 31, 2020. 
 
Because of the limited manpower of non-teaching personnel and given the 
restrictions on hiring new employees, the current CBA staff will be given proper 
training in accounting to equip her with necessary knowledge in handling business 
transactions of the Business Resource Generation (BRG). 

 
The BRS for the months of November and December 2019 were submitted on 
March 26, 2021, while BRS for the months of CY 2020 will be submitted on April 12, 
2021 
 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
That Audit Team will review the submitted BRS for the months of November and 
December 2019 and JEVs; and will communicate to Management results thereof. 
As of this writing no BRS for all the months of CY 2020 were submitted to the Audit 
Team.  
 
The Audit Team will strictly monitor management’s future compliance. 
 

5. The accuracy and existence of the reported year-end balance of Inventories in 
the Statement of Financial Position totaling P8,051,576.78 could not be 
ascertained due to: (a) incomplete Report on the Physical Count of 
Inventories (RPCI); (b) Stock Card (SC) maintained by the Supply and 
Property Management Office (SPMO) is incomplete; and  (c) non-maintenance 
of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) of the Accounting Office, which was 



 
55 

 
 

inconsistent with Sections 9 and 17, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting 
Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus 
rendering the inventory balance at year-end doubtful and affects the fairness 
of presentation of the account in the financial statements. 

 
Section 9, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume  I provides, among others, that the 
supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the 
perpetual inventory system which requires accounting records to show the amount 
of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) 
by the Accounting Division/Unit and SC (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or 
Property Division/Unit for each item in stock.  
 
Also, Section 17, Chapter 8 of the Manual prescribes that the SLC shall be used to 
record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at 
any time and shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of 
supplies and materials. While, the SC shall be used to record all receipts and issues 
of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be maintained by the 
Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock. Also, the RPCI 
(Appendix 66)  shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of 
inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and 
per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable 
property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 
 
Verification of the submitted RPCI as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the 
items of inventory included in the report consist only of inventory for Office Supplies 
with a total amount per count of P2,460,435.87, which is overstated by P144,814.86 
as compared with the book balance as of year-end of P2,315,621.01. 
 
On the other hand, no physical count on other items of inventory amounting to 
P5,735,955.77 was made, as summarized below: 

 

Items of Inventory  Amount  

Inventory Held for Sale   

  Merchandise inventory P3,366,150.00  

      

Inventory Held for Consumption   

  Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory 136,822.40  

  Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory 82,901.12  

  Agricultural and Marine Supplies Inventory 829,905.50  

  Textbooks and Instructional Materials Inventory 26,788.10  

  Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 683,630.54  

      

Semi-Expandable Machinery and Equipment   

  Semi-Expendable Office Equipment 153,105.64  

  
Semi-Expendable Information and Communications 

Technology 49,296.22  

  Semi-Expendable Agricultural and Forestry Equipment 4,689.00  



 
56 

 
 

Items of Inventory  Amount  

  Semi-Expendable Medical Equipment 18,095.00  

  Semi-Expendable Other Machinery and Equipment 384,572.25  

Total P5,735,955.77  

 
The preceding items of inventory should have been counted and included in the 
preparation of the RPCI and submitted to the Auditor not later than July 31st and 
January 31st of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively, as 
prescribed by the Manual. 
 
Moreover, reconciliation of the variances noted during the actual physical count 
cannot be done as complete and updated record of Stock Cards and Supplies 
Ledger Card are not maintained by the SPMO and the Accounting Office, 
respectively. Thus, the reported balance of the Inventory accounts as of year-end 
will remain doubtful and affects fairness of presentation of the account in the 
financial statements. 
 
We recommended that the University President: 

 
a. direct the duly created Inventory Committee to conduct physical count on 

all items of inventory owned by the University and prepare the RPCI and 
submit the same to the Auditor not later than July 31st and January 31st of 
each year for the first and second semesters, respectively, pursuant to 
provisions of Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM; 

 
b. require the SPMO and Accounting Office to maintain complete and 

updated records of Stock Cards and SLCs, respectively, of all items of 
inventory accounts; and 

 
c. direct the SPMO and Accounting Office to investigate and reconcile, any 

variances noted between the actual physical count and records of Stock 
Cards and SLCs.    

 
Management’s Comment: 

  
Management during exit conference informed the Audit Team that the records of the 
Accounting Office and SPMO were already reconciled. As to the report on physical 
count of inventories they committed to adhere to the audit recommendations.  
 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will validate management’s action and will strictly monitor their 
future compliance. 
 

6. Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) with unexpended balance 
totaling P8,570,329.39, has been idle in the custody of the University for many 
years now, thus deprived the national government of the much needed funds 
for its various projects and programs, contrary to the provisions under 
Section 10 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, 



 
57 

 
 

Items 4.9 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and 
Section 63, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 
 
Section 10 of GAA for FY 2020, on the Reversion, Closure and Transfer of Special 
Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving Funds and Unauthorized Accounts 
provides: 

 
“Departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the 
National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying 
fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and revert all 
balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and 
Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following 
instances: (i) when there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) 
when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they are no longer 
necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which funds 
were established.”  

  
While, Items 4.9 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 
state that the implementing Agency shall return to the Source Agency any unused 
balance upon completion of the project. 

 
Likewise, Section 63, Chapter 6 of the aforementioned GAM provides accounting 
policies for the transfer of funds, to wit: 

 
a. “A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) shall be entered into 

by the SA and the IA for the undertaking by the latter of the 
project of the former. The MOA shall provide for the 
requirements for project implementation and reporting. 

 
b. The fund to be transferred or sub-allotted to the IA shall be a) 

in an amount sufficient for three months operation subject to 
replenishment upon submission of the reports of 
disbursements by the IA, or b) the total project cost, as may 
be determined by the Heads of the two agencies in either 
case.  

 
c. The check shall be issued in the name of the IA for deposit to 

its trust account in its authorized government depository bank. 
The IA shall issue its official receipt in acknowledgment.  

 
d. Depending on the MOA, the fund transfers may be treated as 

a) If the MOA provides a condition that the fund shall be spent 
as specified and any excess shall be returned to the SA, the 
IA shall recognize the receipt of the fund as asset at its fair 
value with a corresponding liability, while the SA shall 
recognize a receivable corresponding to the fund transfer; or 
b) If the MOA provides stipulations or no condition, the IA 
shall recognize the receipt of the fund as asset at its fair value 
with a corresponding revenue, while the SA shall recognize 
an expense corresponding to the fund transfer.   



 
58 

 
 

 
e. A separate subsidiary record for each account shall be 

maintained by the IA whether or not a separate bank account 
is opened.  

 
f. Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the 

agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and 
the RCDisb to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual 
project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be 
approved by the Head of the IA.  

 
g. The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon 

completion of the project, if stipulated in the MOA.  
 

h. The SA shall draw a JEV to take up the reports. The amount 
to take up the liquidation in the RCI shall be net of the cash 
advances granted by the IA to its accountable officers.  

 
i. The IA Auditor shall audit the disbursements out of the trust 

accounts in accordance with existing COA Regulations.  
 

j. The Chief Accountant/Head of the Accounting Division/Unit of 
the IA shall, on the basis of the Notice of Finality of Decision 
(NFD), record in the books of accounts any audit disallowance 
as receivable.  

 
k. When the IA is a Bureau/Regional Office of the SA, the 

procedures for centrally managed projects shall be followed in 
accordance with entries herein provided.” 

 
Audit of the Due to NGAs account disclosed that P8,570,329.39 or 20% of its year-
end balance of P42,956,701.18 has been in the custody of the University for many 
years now. Details of which were summarized as follows:

Total       P8,570,329.39    

 
Records show that the above projects have been idle for up to five years and with 
funds transferred by the source agency to the University as early as CY 2008. 
Likewise, three of the above projects totalling P277,844.00 unexpended balance 
have recipients that are no longer connected with the University; six were 
completed or fully rendered projects which had an excess balance amounting to 
P3,788,509.34; and two terminated/suspended projects with total unexpended 
balance of P998,257.37, all remained in the custody of the University for a 
significant period of time. According to management these funds will soon be 
returned to the source agencies as soon as the required documentations such as 
liquidation and terminal reports were provided by its proponents. 
 
While,  the status of implementation of some of these projects cannot be 
determined due to failure of Management to submit to the Auditor the project 
financial status report as of year-end, together with its supporting documents such 
as Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or approved request for extension of project 
implementation.  

 
Since this is a reiteration with updates of the observation embodied in the CY 2019 
Annual Audit Report (AAR) as Management was not able to fully implement the 
recommendations. The Audit Team would like to emphasize that the unexpended 
balance of fund transfers from various source agencies, having been idle for 
significant period of time in the custody of the University, may have lost their 
intended purpose as mentioned in Section 10 of the GAA of FY 2020. Thus, 
reverting these funds to the General Fund as required by law, could have provided 
the National Government of the much needed funds for its various projects and 
programs. 

 
We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations that Management: 

 
a. require the Accountant and the Project Implementers to return the 

unexpended balance of Due to NGAs account to the source agencies in 
compliance with the provisions of Section 10 of GAA of FY 2020, Items 4.9 
and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I; 



 
61 

 
 

 
b. submit to the Audit Team, for audit purposes, the status of project  

implementation as of December 31, 2020, with supporting documents 
such as Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or approved request for 
extension of project implementation; and 

 
c. instruct the Director for Finance Services to closely monitor the status of 

all Funds transferred to the University.  
 
Management’s Comment: 

  
Management claimed that some projects, such as those coming from CHED took 
them some time in exhausting all efforts to locate the whereabouts of these target 
beneficiaries/students as instructed by the funding agency.  As to the other funded 
projects, offices concerned are able to refund some of these unexpended funds to 
its source agencies and the process is still on-going. 

 
 
 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team reminded the Management to ensure that said target beneficiaries 
are still eligible for the benefit coming from the fund and the Audit Team will strictly 
monitor their compliance. 
 

7. The validity and propriety of the payment of Year-End Assistance to all 
teaching and non-teaching personnel of the University amounting to 
P3,183,000.00 could not be determined due to incomplete documentation to 
support the same, contrary to Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 
1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 

 
Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, provides that claims against government funds shall 
be supported with complete documentation.  
 
Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the guidelines 
and documentary requirements for common government transactions.  
 
Audit of disbursement vouchers for the grant of Year-End Assistance in the amount 
of P3,000.00 each to all teaching and non-teaching personnel of the University for 
CY 2020 with a total amount P3,183,00.00 disclosed that payments made were not 
supported with complete documentation. The lacking documents to substantiate the 
transaction, among others, are as follows: 
  

1. Printed and soft copy of the approved payroll;  
2. Letter to the bank to credit employees account (with detailed listing of 

name of employees, account numbers and amount to be credited);  
3. Certified true copy of the Board of Regent (BOR) Resolution No. 51, series 

of 2020;  
4. List of all teaching and non-teaching personnel of the University entitled to 

the grant as provided in the BOR Resolution, duly certified by the 
University Human Resource Management Officer; and  



 
62 

 
 

5. Copy of legal basis of granting and authorizing payment of year-end 
assistance.  
 

Further, the summary report on human resource distribution showed that the 
University has a total of 1,033 personnel as of year-end, inclusive of permanent, 
temporary, casual, contractual/job order and part-timer. Analysis disclosed excess 
payments made amounting to P84,000.00, computed below: 

 

Total Year-End Assistance               - (per DVs) P   3,183,000.00  

Less: Total Year-End Assistance     - (per Audit)   

          (1,033 x P3,000.00) (3,099,000.00)  

Excess amount P        84,000.00  

 
Foregoing observation casts doubt on the propriety and validity of the said 
transactions.  
 
We recommended that the University President direct officials concerned to 
submit all lacking documents to substantiate the transactions, otherwise said 
transaction shall be suspended in audit. Henceforth, see to it that only claims 
with proper documentation are processed and paid. 
 
Management’s Comment: 

  
The following documents were submitted on March 18, 2021 to the Audit Team to 
substantiate the transactions: 

 

1. Printed and soft copy of the approved payroll; 
2. Transmittal and Payroll Register stamped received by LBP Tanay Branch; and 
3. BOR Resolution and other documents relative to the grant of Year-End 

Assistance including Legal Basis. 
 

List of teaching and non-teaching personnel entitled to the grant will be submitted 
once University Human Resource Management Officer finishes her quarantine.  

 
Excess payment of P84,000.00 as per audit represents payment to 28 retired 
employees of the University which is not included in the summary report on human 
resource distribution as of December 31, 2020. 

 
Management assured that proper documentation of all future transactions will be 
monitored by concerned officials before payment. 
 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
That Audit Team will evaluate the submitted documents by Management and will 
strictly monitor on their future compliance. 
 

8. The University did not implement and maintain a sound internal control 
system on handling collections of its Corporate and Business Affairs (CBA), 
contrary to the pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445,

Section 2 of PD No. 1445 dictates the declared policy of the State and the 
responsibility to take care such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the 
chief or head of the government agency concerned. 
 
Also, Section 124 of PD No.1445 states the direct responsibility of the agency head 
to install, implement and monitor a sound system of internal control.   
 
Audit of collection and deposit transactions of the University CBA disclosed the 
following internal control deficiency: 

 
8.1. Collections were not deposited intact daily or the next banking day from 

receipt thereof, contrary to Section 69(1) and (4) of the PD No. 1445, thus 
may expose funds to risk of loss or misapplication. While part of 
collections was used to defray operating expenses, not in accordance 
with Section 14, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
Section 69 of PD No. 1445 provides: 
 

“(1) Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys 
arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit 
or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by 
them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the 
particular accounts to which the said moneys belong. The 
amount of the collections ultimately payable to other agencies of 
the government shall thereafter be remitted to the respective 
treasuries of these agencies, under regulations which the 
Commission and the Department (Ministry) of Finance shall 
prescribe. Xxx 
 
(4) The respective treasuries of these agencies shall in turn 
deposit with the proper government depository the full amount of 
the collections not later than the following banking day.” 

 
While, Section 14, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states: 

 
“Cash disbursements constitute payments out of cash advances 
granted to the regular and special disbursing officers for personal 
services, petty expenses and MOOE for field operating 
requirements. All cash payments shall be covered by duly 
approved DVs/payrolls/petty cash vouchers (PCVs). The cash 
advances may be granted to the cashiers/disbursing 
officers/officials and employees to cover the following: salaries 
and wages, travels, special time-bound undertakings and petty 
operating expenses.” (emphasis supplied) 

 
Review on Management’s compliance on previous year’s audit recommendation on 
handling collections and deposits of the University CBA Office revealed anew that 



 
64 

 
 

not all collections were deposited intact daily or the next banking day from receipt 
thereof, with delays ranging from one to 20 days, as shown in Annex E. 

 
Moreover, P275,344.00 of the total collections of the CBA during the year was not 
deposited but used to pay for operational expenses, such as repairs, 
representation, supplies, fuel, etc, which is inconsistent to a sound internal control. 
Whenever there’s a need for immediate available funds to pay petty or operating 
expenses, we enjoin Management to grant cash advance instead of using cash 
collections on hand, with strict observance on the provisions of the above Manual.   
 
The foregoing practice is unfavorable to the interest of the government and could 
result to loss or abuse of use of funds. 

 
We reiterated our prior year’s audit recommendations that the URS President: 

 
a. instruct the concerned officials to strictly comply with Section 69(1) and 

(4) of the PD No. 1445 by depositing all his/her collections intact and in 
full amount within the next banking day, or where collections are minimal 
and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the concerned 
officials shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as 
the collections reach P10,000.00, to the Authorized Government 
Depository Bank;  

 
b. direct the CBA Office Head to refrain from using collections to defray 

operational expenses, and whenever a transaction that requires payment 
in cash, strictly observed Section 14, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I; and 

 
c. instruct the Director of Finance Services to closely monitor the activities 

of CBA Office to ensure compliance of the concerned personnel to the 
abovementioned law, rules and regulations. 

 
Management’s Comment: 

 
Management committed to strictly follow the audit recommendation in its future 
transactions and will observed the above mentioned provisions of law and 
regulation. 

 
8.2. Receipt of collection is being done by the CBA personnel not covered by 

fidelity bond, contrary to Section 101 of PD No. 1445 and Section 4.1 of 
Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009, thus the University 
may not be indemnified in the event of losses. 

 
Section 101 of PD No. 1445 states: 

 
“Accountable officers; bond requirements. 
 

(1) Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit 
or require the possession or custody of government funds or 
property shall be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping 
thereof in conformity with law. 



 
65 

 
 

 
(2) Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in 

accordance with law.” 
 

While, Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 issued by 
the Bureau of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of the Public Bonding Law 
(PBL), provides: 

 
“Public Officers Covered – Every officer, agent, and employee of 
the Government of the Philippines or of the companies or 
corporations of which the majority stock is held by the National 
Government (NG), regardless of the status of their appointment 
shall, whenever the nature of the duties performed by such 
officer, agent or employee permits or requires the possession, 
custody or control of funds or properties for which he is 
accountable, be deemed a bondable officer and shall be bonded 
or bondable and his fidelity insured (Section 314 & 318, PBL).” 

 
Validation of compliance to prior year’s audit recommendations disclosed that none 
of which are fully complied. The personnel of the CBA Office doing collection and 
deposit are still not covered with fidelity bond, contrary to the above laws, rules and 
regulations. 
 
Review of collections handled by the CBA personnel during the year range from 
P28,630.00 up to P3,854,784.00 (Annex E). Management’s effort to comply with 
the audit recommendation became futile because the newly bonded CBA personnel 
was re-assigned to other department, thus the University still would not be 
indemnified in the event of losses. 
 
Management might consider delegating or transfer the collection and deposit 
function of the CBA transactions to Campus Cashiers in order to minimize expenses 
and ensure prompt deposit since this is already the latter’s daily routine. 
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President: 

 
a. instruct the Director for Finance Services to facilitate the application of 

Fidelity bond of the concerned personnel of the University CBA Office or 
implement other possible alternative solutions such as delegating or 
transfer of collection and deposit function to Campus Cashiers; and 

 
b. ensure that all employees of the University whose duties permit or require 

the possession or custody of government funds or property are properly 
bonded in accordance with Section 101 of PD No. 1445 and Section 4.1 of 
Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 to provide protection 
on the URS’ cash resources. 

 
Management’s Comment: 

 
Management committed to strictly follow the audit recommendation in its future 
transactions and will observed the above mentioned provisions of law and 
regulation. 



 
66 

 
 

 
8.3. Non-issuance of Official Receipt (OR) on collection from sale of books 

for Laboratory School amounting to P2,956,734.00 was noted, contrary 
to Section 68(1) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus may expose 
collections to risk of loss. 

 
Section 68 (1) of PD No. 1445 states: 

 
“No payment of any nature shall be received by a collecting 
officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in 
acknowledgment thereof. The receipt may be in the form of 
postage, internal revenue or documentary stamps and the like, 
officially numbered receipts, subject to proper custody, 
accountability, and audit.” 

 
Audit of collections and deposits disclosed that the proceeds from sale of books for 
Laboratory School in Morong Campus amounting to P2,956,734.00 had no Official 
Receipt issued acknowledging the receipt thereof. Management averred that the 
collection was not receipted due to implementation of community quarantine 
brought by the pandemic.  

 
Although the said amount was deposited in full, the foregoing practice shows 
weakness in internal control over cash and not accordance with the above provision 
of law and if not stop might result to loss of funds needed by the University to 
discharge its mandate. 

 
We recommended that the University President thru the Director for Finance 
Service instruct all Collecting Officers (COs) receiving payment of any nature 
in behalf of the University shall issue Official Receipts (OR) to acknowledge 
receipt thereof, pursuant to the provisions of Section 68(1) of PD No. 1445. 
 
Management’s Comment: 
 
Management committed to strictly follow the audit recommendation in its future 
transactions and will observed the above mentioned provision of law. 
 

9. Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) amounting at least P18,550,769.26 were paid 
despite incomplete documentation, contrary to Section 4(6) of Presidential 
Decree (PD) No. 1445, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, COA 
Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and pertinent provisions of the 
2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) 
No. 9184, hence, the propriety and validity of the claims could not be readily 
ascertained.  

 
Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that “Claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.”  

 
Also, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the guidelines and 
documentary requirements for common government transactions. 
 



 
67 

 
 

Likewise, RA No. 9184 and its 2016 Revised IRR provide procedural and 
documentary requirements for government procurement. 

 
Post-audit of selected transactions of the University for the current year amounting 
to P18,550,769.26 (Annex F) revealed that the disbursements were paid even with 
incomplete supporting documents, thus propriety and validity of the claims could not 
be readily determined. Among the significant deficiencies noted were the following: 

 
a. Payments made on utilization of Covid-19 Funds amounting to P586,377.00 

during the year for the projects funded by the Commission on Higher 
Education (CHED): “Production of Soap to  combat Covid-19” and “URSafe 
with URS: Response to Covid-19 Challenge - Washable Facemask for 
Frontliners”, both lack appropriate documents that will support actual quantity 
of soap and face mask produced, list of recipients, delivery or 
acknowledgment receipts, pictures (during production, soap and face mask 
produced and delivery of the products to target beneficiaries); 

 
b. Procurement of infrastructure project done through public bidding amounting 

to P9,992,510.27 pertaining to construction of concrete perimeter fence at 
URS Tanay Campus was not supported with the following documentations: 

 
b.1. Minutes of the pre-procurement conference (Section 20.2 of the 2016 

Rev. IRR of RA 9184) 
b.2. Certification of BAC Secretariat that the ITB was posted for 7 CDs at 

any conspicuous place in the premises of the procuring entity. (Section 
21.2.1.a  of the Rev. IRR of RA 9184) 

b.3. Minutes of the Pre-bid conference for projects with ABC of P1million 
and up) (Section 22.4  of the 2016 Rev. IRR of RA 9184) 

b.4. Approved Plans and Specifications/Drawings – (as plan and as built) 
(Sections 17.1.g  of the 2016 Rev. IRR of RA 9184) 

b.5. Agency Approved Program of Work with detailed estimates of work, 
items, quantities and cost and PERT/CPM network of the project 
activities. (Item 3.i of Annex “A” of the 2016 Rev. IRR of RA 9184) 

b.6. Certificate that the Detailed Engineering investigations, surveys and 
designs have been conducted in accordance with the prescribed 
agency standards and specifications in conformance with the 
provisions of “Item 5 of Annex “A” of the 2016 Rev. IRR of RA 9184” 

b.7. Notice of the BAC to the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid (Sec. 
34.2 of the 2016 Rev. IRR of RA 9184) 

b.8. PhilGEPS posting of NOA and in any conspicuous place in the agency 
premises, within 3 CDs from its issuance (Sec. 37.1.6 of the 2016 Rev. 
IRR of RA 9184) and 

b.9. PhilGEPS posting of NTP and in procuring entity website, if any, within 
15 CDs from issuance of NTP (Sec. 37.4.2 of the 2016 Rev. IRR of RA 
9184); 

 
c. Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) in payment for books, catering services for 

various meetings and office supplies amounting to P6,858,437.45 do not 
have the following documents to support the claims: 

 
c.1. Purchase Request (PR) 



 
68 

 
 

c.2. Purchase Order (PO) 
c.3. Obligation Request Status (ORS)/Budget Utilization Request and 

Status (BURS) 
c.4. Official Receipts (OR) or Sales Invoice (SI) 
c.5. Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) 
c.6. Canvass from at least three suppliers 
c.7. Summary/Abstract of canvass 
c.8. Certificate of Non-availability of Stocks (CNAS) – for purchased office 

supplies only 
c.9. Notice of meetings, minutes of the meeting and attendance sheet – for 

catering services only; 
 
d. Payments for royalty fee amounting to P31,740.00 do not have copy of 

Royalty Agreement attached to DVs and the document showing 
computations of royalty fee was not verified and approved by appropriate 
authorities; and 

 
e. Disbursements made to replace staled or cancelled checks totaling 

P1,081,704.54 – do not have any attachments, DVs only. The original staled 
or cancelled checks and its supporting documents were not attached to the 
claim to substantiate the transactions. 

 
We recommended that the University President direct concerned personnel to 
submit all lacking documents to the Office of the Audit Team immediately for 
audit purposes.  Otherwise, a Notice of Suspension will be issued for the said 
transactions in accordance with the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts (RRSA). Henceforth, direct the University Accountant to refrain 
from processing for payment transactions not completely documented 
pursuant to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 
June 14, 2012 and RA No. 9184 and its revised IRR. 
 
Management’s Comment: 

  
Management, during the exit conference, committed to submit the foregoing 
documents and assured that the same will be strictly observe on the succeeding 
transactions of the University. 

 
10. Delayed submission of 2,244 Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) or 90% of 

submitted (DVs) during the CY 2020, ranging from one to 360 days, which is 
contrary to Section 7.2.1 of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts (RRSA) as prescribed under Commission on Audit (COA) Circular 
No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. Moreover, 23 DVs and their 
supporting documents with a total amount of P1,654,974.39 remain 
unsubmitted as of report date. This hampered the audit of the accounts and 
transactions of the University and the Audit Team’s communication to the 
Management of any deficiencies noted.   

   
Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 
September 15, 2009 states:  

 



 
69 

 
 

“The Chief Accountant, bookkeeper or other authorized official 
performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the 
audited agency shall ensure that reports and supporting 
documents submitted by the accountable officers are 
immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to 
the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.” 

 
Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 of the above Circular, also provides: 

 
“Section 7.1.1 – The head of the agency, who is primarily 
responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to 
his agency, shall ensure that (a) the required financial and other 
reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency 
officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the 
Commission; xxx” 

 
“Section 7.1.2 – The head of the Agency shall initiate the 
necessary administrative and/or criminal action in case of 
unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with the foregoing 
requirements by subordinate officials.” 

 
Records showed that out of 2,504 DVs submitted to the Audit Team during the CY 
2020, 90% or 2,244 DVs (Annex G) were submitted late ranging from one to 360 
days, contrary to Section 7.2.1 of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts (RRSA) as prescribed under Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 
2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. Said DVs consist of transactions in payment 
for payroll, utilities, remittances, etc. 

 
While, verification of the completeness of the submitted accounts disclosed that 23 
DVs (Annex H) and their supporting documents with a total amount of 
P1,654,974.39 remain  unsubmitted as of reporting date. 

 
Management, just like in previous years, explained that some of the DVs are 
pending for complete documentation before submission to the Auditor; some of 
these transactions pertain to remittances and payment of utilities, wherein, 
payments were left to the bank teller by the personnel of the University and retrieve 
the same on a later date.    

 
The above practice causes delay on the audit of the accounts and transactions of 
the University and consequently, the Audit Team was not able to communicate 
timely to the Management any deficiencies noted for corrective action.    

 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President: 

 
a. direct the University Cashier to immediately submit the DVs enumerated 

in Annex H, otherwise said transactions shall be suspended in audit; 
 
b. instruct the Director for Finance Services to ensure that all DVs and their 

supporting documents are submitted to the Auditor within the prescribed 
period to facilitate timely audit of the accounts and transactions of the 



 
70 

 
 

URS, pursuant to Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA prescribed under COA 
Circular No. 2009-006; and 

 
c. initiate appropriate action when necessary, against the concerned 

personnel in accordance with Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 of the same COA 
Circular.  

 
Management’s Comment: 

  
The outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic inevitably affected nations worldwide. The 
Civil Service Commission adopted guidelines on Alternative Work Arrangements 
and Support Mechanisms for Workers in the Government. The University in 
particular has adopted alternative work arrangements during this pandemic period. 
Although several options were included, majority of employees across agencies 
implemented the work from home arrangement for the safety of everyone. 

 
DVs for transactions in payment for payroll, utilities, remittances were identified to 
be submitted late, due to majority of the areas were placed under community 
quarantine, hence, offices are not transacting with their stakeholders. 

 
The 23 unsubmitted DVs will be submitted immediately once required documents 
are complete. 

 
To further address the audit findings, additional measures to be implemented are: 
 
1. One staff from the campus cashier has been designated to handle the scanning 

and filing of one fund as an assistance to the University Cashier; and 
2. Acquisition of heavy duty photocopying machine. 
 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will strictly monitor Management’s compliance. 

 
11. Three Hundred Thirty-Two (332) issued Purchase Orders (POs) and their 

supporting documents for the procurement of supplies, equipment and 
infrastructure materials during the CY 2020 with an aggregate amount of 
P40,656,458.44 were not submitted to the Audit Team for review, within five (5) 
working days from issuance thereof, contrary to COA Circular Nos. 2009-001 
and 96-010 dated February 12, 2009 and August 15, 1996, respectively. 
Moreover, 164 of these POs with a total amount of P24,743,678.64 were not 
properly accomplished and have inconsistencies which could have been 
communicated to Management earlier for corrective actions. 

 
Item 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, requires among 
others, that copies of any purchase order irrespective of amount and each and 
every supporting document, shall, within 5 working days from issuance thereof, be 
submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review 
and point out to Management defects and/or deficiencies, if any.  

 
While, COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996 provides the basic data 
which should invariably appear in the PO, as follows: 



 
71 

 
 

 
1. Purchase Order Number 
2. Date of Purchase Order 
3. Complete Name of Supplier 
4. Complete Address of the Supplier 
5. Information whether the supplier is a manufacturer or exclusive distributor; 

registered with SEC, DTI or both 
6. Telephone and fax number of supplier, if any 
7. Date of delivery 
8. Complete item name 
9. Complete detailed item specification, including accessories i.e., narrative 

description, size/dimension/volume, model, use of item, color, capacity, 
horsepower, voltage, watts, gauge, kind of equipment where spare parts to 
be used whether replacement or original (for spare parts), part number of 
spare parts, type and classification of material, brand new or second hand, 
etc. 

10. Price (individual unit price; if lot price any document showing the detailed 
breakdown of the cost should likewise be submitted) 

11. Unit of measure when it is not universally accepted indicate numbers or 
weight, or lineal measure, i.e., if stated as per “roll”, indicate the number of 
yards/meter per roll; if per “box”, state number/pieces contents; if per “bag”, 
how many pounds or kilos 

12. Quantity or number of units 
13. Brand name. If no brand name, state “none” 
14. Country of manufacture or origin of item; i.e., local (RP), or if foreign origin, 

specify country 
15. Terms; i.e., COD, n/30 days, etc. 
16. Mode of procurement i.e., public bidding, canvass, negotiated sale, and such 

other authorized modes. If "repeat order" indicate previous Purchase Order 
and date which was used as basis. 

17. Taxes paid by agency; i.e., VAT, etc. If taxes are paid by supplier, do not 
indicate. 

 
It was observed that the concerned personnel of the University stopped the 
submission of copies of Purchase Orders to the Audit Team. Management averred 
that POs together with the Purchase Request (PR), Invoices and Delivery Receipts 
were submitted only upon receipt of the procured item/s to minimize the process. 
However, record shows that no copies of POs, PRs, Invoice and other supporting 
documents were submitted to the Audit Team for review during the year. 
 
Review of disbursement transactions disclosed that a total of 332 issued POs           
(Annex I) for the procurement of supplies, equipment and infrastructure materials 
during the CY 2020 with an aggregate amount of P40,656,458.44 were not 
submitted to the Audit Team for review, within five working days from issuance 
thereof. 

 
Moreover, 164 of these POs with a total amount of P24,743,678.64 were not 
properly accomplished (Annex J) and some have noted deficiencies (Annex K). 
Management could have been immediately notified if submission of copies of the 
same had been made within the prescribed period pursuant to the above mentioned 
COA Circulars. 



 
72 

 
 

We recommended that the University President: 
 

a. direct the Supply/Property Officer to ensure timely submission of the POs 
and their supporting documents to the Audit Team as prescribed by COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, to facilitate review of the 
same so that Management could be notified immediately of any noted 
deficiencies thereon; 
 

b. instruct Supply/Property Officer to properly accomplished all POs and 
ensure that all relevant information required in COA Circular No. 96-010 
dated August 15, 1996 are completely indicated therein; and 
 

c. direct the concerned personnel to provide satisfactory explanation on the 
non-submission of the POs and on the noted deficiencies. 

 
Management’s Comment: 

  
The implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine caused by COVID 19 
pandemic resulted in the closure of offices in the Province of Rizal and the work 
from home scheme was implemented. When the University personnel were allowed 
to report to work; the one in-charge for the submission of the perfected Purchase 
Orders has already retired from the Government Service. The submission of 
perfected Purchase Order to the COA Office was inadvertently overlooked and no 
staff was assigned to do the task. 

 
An instruction was issued to assign one member of the BAC Secretariat to handle 
the task and to strictly observe and adhere with the Circular. 

 
Management assured that the perfected Purchase Orders together with their 
attachments shall be submitted to the COA office within the prescribed period. 
 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
That Audit Team will evaluate the submitted documents by Management and will 
strictly monitor on their future compliances. 
 

Gender and Development 
 

12. The University Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget (GPB) was 
not updated based on the final agency budget per General Appropriations Act 
(GAA) of CY 2020, contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Philippine 
Commission on Women-National Economic and Development Authority-
Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) 
No. 2012-01. Moreover, the GAD Fund has unutilized balance amounting to 
P20,560,000.00 as of year-end due to insufficient GAD database maintained 
and excessive allocation of budget for each GAD PAPs, thus objectives for 
which the funds were provided were not fully attained.  

 
Item 8.8 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 states that “Once the 
GAA has been approved and where budget and program adjustments have to be 
made based on the final agency budgets, agencies shall submit an adjusted GPB to 



 
73 

 
 

PCW. The adjusted GPB shall be the basis for implementing the GPBs as well as 
for monitoring and reporting.” 

 
Also, Item 9.2 of the above Joint Circular states: 

 
“Agencies shall inform the PCW in writing if there are changes in 
the PCW-endorsed GPBs as a result of revising the GPB based 
on the approved GAA and or the need to implement additional 
PAPs relevant to current gender issues or GAD-related 
undertakings as needed. PCW, in turn, shall acknowledge 
receipt of adjusted GPB and shall inform the agencies if the GAD 
PAPs or activities in the adjusted GPB are acceptable.” 

 
Likewise, Item 6.2 of the above Joint Circular provides guidelines pursuant to 
Section 37A.1c of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 
9710 or the Magna Carta of Women (MCW-IRR), on how agency’s GAD budget 
may be allocated using any or a combination of the following: 

 
1. As a separate GAD fund to support GAD-focused PPAs; 
2. As fund to support integrating gender perspective in major programs and 

projects (gender mainstreaming); and 
3. As counterpart fund to support gender-responsive Official Development 

Assistance (ODA)-funded projects 
 

While, Items 6.3 and 6.4.1 of the above Joint Circular states: 
 

“6.3 The utilization and outcome of the GAD budget shall be 
annually monitored and evaluated in terms of its success in 
influencing the gender-responsive implementation of agency 
programs funded by the remaining ninety-five percent (95%) 
budget (MCW Chapter VI, Section 36).” 

 
“6.4.1 If an agency intends to attribute a portion or the whole 
budget of major programs during the GAD planning and 
budgeting phase, it may subject the program to gender analysis 
using the HGDG tool. If the agency is not yet trained on the use 
of the tool, it may include said training in its GPB and may seek 
the assistance of an expert on gender analysis using the 
HGDG.”   

 
Review of the University’s CY 2020 GPB disclosed that the submitted GPB was not 
based on the final agency budget per GAA of CY 2020, contrary to the provisions of 
the above Joint Circular.  

 
On the other hand, out of the P26,150,000.00 total GAD allocation per GPB, 
P20,560,000.00 or 79% of the total GAD budget of the University left unutilized as 
of year-end. Review of the agency’s GPB vis-à-vis its GAD Accomplishment Report 
(GAD-AR) disclosed that four out of 15 GAD Projects, Activities and Programs 
(PAPs) were not implemented because of the various community quarantine 
implemented due to Covid-19 pandemic. Out of the 11 fully implemented GAD 
PAPs during the year, only one of which was able to attain its desired result, while 



 
74 

 
 

target outcome for the rest of the GAD PAPs, for both client and organization 
focused, were partially achieved. 

 
The 11 fully implemented GAD PAPs accounts to P19,750,000.00 or 76% of total 
GAD allocation, wherein, the actual cost incurred including attribution to fully 
implement the said PAPs amounts only to P5,590,000.00. In this regard, the 
University GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) allocated more than necessary to 
implement each GAD PAPs thus, leaving a significant amount of unutilized GAD 
fund at year-end.  

 
Moreover, another observed reason of having a significant amount of unutilized 
balance of GAD fund is insufficiency of GAD database maintained by the University. 
As mentioned in the previous years’ Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), the 
condition of having identified gender issues in their GPB not based on results of 
analysis or review of GAD-related issues present during planning still exists thus, 
factual gender issues present in the University might not have been identified and 
properly addressed. The lack of source of inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, 
programming and policy formulation that addresses gender issues and concerns of 
agency personnel and clients, limits the capacity of the University to expend its 
budget to GAD related PAPs that will benefit its intended beneficiaries. 

 
This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation due to failure of the University 
Management to fully implement the audit recommendations and the objectives for 
which the GAD funds were provided remained not fully attained. 

 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President: 

 
a. direct the University GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to maintain 

sufficient GAD database containing sex disaggregated data and updated 
gender-related statistics, and consider the same in identifying priority 
gender issues to be addressed during GAD planning in accordance with 
PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01; 

 
b. instruct concerned University Officials to maximize utilization or 

attribution of the GAD funds through integration of gender perspective in 
the University programs, activities and projects to achieve the desired 
outcomes for GAD using gender analysis tool introduced by appropriate 
authority, in compliance with the pertinent provisions of the PCW-NEDA-
DBM Joint Circular; and 

 
c. direct the Head of the University GAD Center to review the 

reasonableness of budget allocation for each seminar/workshop through 
regular monitoring of actual expenses of each GAD activity for possible 
adjustments, so that other equally gender responsive activities may be 
incorporated in the GPB to make the best use of the fund.  

 
In addition, we recommended that the University President instruct the GFPS 
to revise the GPB once the GAA has been approved, in compliance with Items 
8.8 and 9.2 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001, copy 
furnished the Resident Auditor with the revised GPB.

Management’s Comment: 
 

Implementation of the planned GAD related programs, activities and projects were 
affected by the implementation of different community quarantines in the areas 
where campuses are located due to pandemic. Management assured that the audit 
recommendations will be observed in the CY 2021.  
 
Audit Team Rejoinder: 

 
The Audit Team will strictly monitor management’s future compliance. 
 

Compliance with Tax Laws 
 

13. Non-withholding of taxes on purchases of goods and services amounting to 
P6,840,533.45, contrary to pertinent Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) 
regulations, thus deprived the national government of the immediate use of 
the fund amounting to P324,856.30.  
 
Section 2 (J) of the BIR Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 
2018 provides:  
 

“Income Payments made by a government office, national or 
local, including barangay, or their attached agencies or bodies, 
and government-owned or controlled corporations to its 
local/resident supplier of goods/services, other than those 
covered by other rates of withholding tax. [formerly under letter 
(N)] – Income payments, except any single purchase which is 
P10,000.00 and below, which are made by a government office, 
national of local, including barangay, or their attached agencies 
or bodies, and government-owned or controlled corporations, on 
their purchases of goods and purchases of services from 
local/resident suppliers:  
 

Supplier of goods - One percent (1%)  
Supplier of services - Two percent (2%) 

 
While, Section 4-114-2 of the BIR RR No. 13-2018 dated March 15, 2018 states: 
  

“(a) Withholding of Value-added Tax. – The Government or any 
of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, 
including government owned or -controlled corporations 
(GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each 
purchase of goods and services which are subject to the value 
added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct 
and withhold the value-added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 
108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at 
the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof; xxx”  
 

Likewise, Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2014 dated June 20, 2014 
was issued to clarify and consolidate the responsibilities of the public sector to 
withhold taxes on its transactions as customer (on its purchases of goods and 



 
76 

 
 

services) and as an employer (on compensation paid to its officials and employees) 
under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, which 
includes, among others, the obligation to withhold tax on Government Money 
Payments (GMP) - on purchases of goods and services from Non-VAT registered 
supplier/payees of three percent (3%) of the gross payment.  
 
Audit of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) relative to the purchases of goods and 
services made by the University during the CY2020 amounting to P6,840,533.45 
disclosed that the Accounting Unit failed to deduct the required withholding tax on 
income payments and on GMP.  
 
This practice deprived the government of the immediate use of the fund amounting 
to P324,856.30 (Annex L). Also, the University as a withholding agent, might incur 
penalty in the future for failure to withhold and remit appropriate taxes due to the 
government pursuant to the Tax Code.  

 
We recommended that the University President:  
 
a. direct the University Accountant to require concerned Suppliers to show 

proof of tax payment due to BIR amounting to P324,856.30 for the income  
and government money payments; and  

 
b. instruct the University Accountant to ensure that the required withholding 

taxes are deducted before making any payments to supplier of goods and 
services and to remit the same to the BIR within the prescribed period 
pursuant to its existing regulations.  

 
Management’s Comment: 

  
The Head of CBA, in response, that they will communicate and write letters to the 
concerned publishing houses and businesses to remit the amount of withholding 
taxes that should have been deducted from their claims.  
 
Management assured that for FY 2021, strict compliance of deducting withholding 
taxes to every transaction shall be implemented. 
 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will strictly monitor management’s future compliance. 

 
Compliance with GSIS, Pag-ibig and Philhealth laws and regulations 

 
The University deducted the mandatory premiums from their employee’s payroll and 
recorded the same under the Due to GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth accounts, 
together with the employer’s share. Premium contributions for the month of 
December 2020 were partially remitted on December 28, 2020 and the balance on 
the immediately preceding month.

Unsettled Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 
14. The disallowed prior year transactions of the University amounting to 

P11,475,610.67 which became final and executory was not recognized in the 
books of account, contrary to Section 46, Chapter 6 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 
I, hence, understated the related receivable and equity accounts by the same 
amount.  
 
Section 46, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states:  
 

“Accounting for Disallowances. Disallowances shall be taken up in 
the books of accounts only when they become final and executory. 
The Accountant shall prepare the JEV to take up the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges and credit the appropriate account for the 
current year or Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account if pertaining 
to expenses of previous years. Cash settlement of disallowances 
shall be acknowledged through the issue of an official receipt and 
reported by the Cashier in the RCD.”  
 

Likewise, Section 47, Chapter 6 of the Manual provides illustrative accounting 
entries to record disallowance for current and prior year’s transactions. 
 
Review of the submitted Financial Statements for the CY2020 disclosed that the 
disallowed transactions of prior years, which became final and executory during the 
year was not recorded in the books of account of the University.  
 
The Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2019-001 (2007-2015) dated September 30, 
2019 amounting to P11,475,610.67 pertains to the disallowed transactions of the 
University for the payment of seed money amounting to P2,000,000.00 for the 
establishment of the University Provident Fund, Inc. and accumulated amount of 
P9,475,610.67 representing University share equal to one percent of each members 
monthly basic salary from CY 2007 up to CY 2015. Said ND was served to the 11 
persons named liable on October 10, 11 and 15, 2019.  
 
Last November 2020, a Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) was issued  there being 
no appeal filed by persons liable within the reglementary period. The above ND has 
become final and executory, but the Accountant failed to record the same, contrary 
to Section 46, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I thus, understate the balances 
of the receivable and equity accounts presented in the financial statements, by the 
same amount of the disallowance.  
 
We recommended that the President direct the Accountant to prepare a 
Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to take up the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges and credit the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account 
for the total amount of the disallowance, pursuant to Section 46, Chapter 6 of 
the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

Management’s Comment: 
 
The audit observation was already adjusted and recognized in the books and 
included in the January 2021 Financial Reports. JEV No. 052-21-01-34D was 
prepared to recognized the Notice of Disallowance No. 2019-001 (2007-2015) 
which became final and executory on November 20, 2020.  
 
The unsettled Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges of the University as 
of the end of the year, are as follows:

It should be noted, however, that the status of outstanding disallowances are all on 
appeal with the COA Region IV-A, except for the P11,475,610.67 which became 
final and executory during the year.

1. The reported

Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE) 
accounts, with a net 
book value of 
P417,205,267.45 as 
of December 31, 
2019 are unreliable 
due to unrecorded 
items of PPE such as 
land, buildings and

3 and 5, Chapter 10 
of Government 
Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National 
Government 
Agencies (NGAs),

We reiterated our 

recommendations 

that the University 

President: 

 

a. direct the 
concerned officials 
of Supply and 
Property 
Management 
Office (SPMO) to 
conduct the actual 
inventory of 
buildings and other 
structures and 
parcels of land, 
and the Accounting 
Division to account 
and record such 
property at fair 
value, pursuant to 
Sections 3 and 5,

Officers, but no 
appraisal was made to 
determine fair value of 
these properties,
