EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction

The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), is an autonomous 
region located in the southern Philippines. This replaced the Autonomous Region in 
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). 

The BARMM was formed with the ratification of its basic law, the Bangsamoro Organic
Law (BOL), or Republic Act 11054, after holding a two-part legally-binding plebiscite in 
the six provinces composing the former ARMM held on January 21, 2019. Also included 
in the plebiscite are the cities of Cotabato and Isabela in the provinces of Maguindanao and 
Basilan, respectively. The ratification was confirmed a few days later on January 25, 2019
by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) after the results of the plebiscite showed 
majority of the five provinces, namely Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu and 
Tawi-Tawi, and the city of Cotabato showed support for the ratification of the law.
During the February 6, 2019 referendum, 63 of the 67 barangays in the province of 
Cotabato voted in favor and joined the BARMM.

The Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission-BARMM (BHRC-BARMM) is created 
under Section 7, Article IX of Republic Act No. 11054, otherwise known as the 
Bangsamoro Organic Law of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. 
It shall be the human rights institution of the Bangsamoro.

As the human rights institution of the Bangsamoro, the Commission shall promote and 
protect human rights and, during armed conflict, uphold international humanitarian law.
Act No. 4, Article IV provides for the powers and functions of the Bangsamoro Human 
Rights Commission as follows:

1) Promote human rights through education and training, public awareness, and 
publication:

2) Protect human rights and uphold international humanitarian law through 
conducting investigations, monitoring, fact finding missions, and public inquiries, 
reporting the results of the same, and processing with prosecution when warranted;

3) Advise the government, as its own instance or upon request, on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and international humanitarian law;

4) Protect human rights defenders;
5) Act as the transitional justice mechanism;
6) Perform administrative functions, particularly:

a. Implement its organizational structure and staffing pattern;
b. Adopt:

• an annual budget for the approval of the Parliament;
• strategic plans taking into account the content on which it operates for 

purposes of setting its priorities and for the proper allocation of its financial 
and human resources;



ii

• program, activities, project, services, and initiative pursuant to its mandate,
powers, and functions;

• communications and information plans;
• monitoring and evaluation mechanism;
• a manual of operation; and
• a seal and logo

7) Approve core services in accordance with its mandate, powers, and functions;
8) Conduct performance audit over investigation personnel and administrative staff;
9) Solicit and accept grants, aid, donations, and gifts, in cash or in kind, or enter into 

agreements with any legitimate entity, local or foreign, consistent with its mandate, 
provided that it will not undermine its independence; and

10) Acquire, possess, and dispose of real and personal properties in furtherance of its 
mandate;

11) Perform such other powers and functions as may be provided by law, consistent 
with its mandate, independence, and fiscal autonomy.

iii

Opinion of the auditor on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements. 

The Auditor rendered a Qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial 
statements (FS) of the BHRC-BARMM, as of December 31, 2020 in view of the deficiency
noted in the accounts and non-compliance with the existing laws, rules and regulations as 
stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II of this report.

Summary of Significant Observations and corresponding Recommendations:

1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) balance amounting to P13,498,073.49 could 
not be relied upon due to the failure of management to reconcile periodically the 
Accounting records and the Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE)  provided under  Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting 
Manual (GAM)

2. The agency failed to close and revert unused cash of dormant accounts, contrary to 
Executive Order No. 431,  DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and COA 
Circular No. 2015-001.

We enjoin the Managements to ensure full implementation of all partially and not 
implemented prior years’ audit recommendations to improve operational as well as 
financial efficiency of the agencies.

COMMISSION ON AUDIT

Bangsamoro Government Center, Cotabato City

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

Atty. ABDUL RASHID P. KALIM
Chairperson
Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission
Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao

Qualified Opinion

We have audited the Financial Statements (FS) of the Bangsamoro Human Rights 
Commission, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BHRC-BARMM),
which comprises the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the 
Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, 
Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 
for the year then ended, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis of Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the accompanying Financial Statements present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of BHRC-BARMM as at December 31, 2020,
and its financial performance, cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual 
amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector 
Accounting Standards (IPSASs).  

Basis for Qualified Opinion

The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) balance amounting to P13,498,073.49 could 
not be relied upon due to the failure of management to reconcile the Accounting records 
and the Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibility under those standards are further described in the 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the FS, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Other than the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we would 
like to convey some of the noted weaknesses in internal control:



2

Failure to periodically reconcile the PPE balance with the RPCPPE balance
Lapses in recording of financial transactions

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the FS in 
accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of FS that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Agency’s financial 
reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.

PART  II

DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS 
AND RECOMMENDATIONS



20

DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The agency failed to close and revert unused cash of dormant accounts, contrary 
to Executive Order No. 431, DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and 
COA Circular No. 2015-001.

1.1. Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 directs the reversion of all 
dormant accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds to the general fund 
and for other purposes. It further emphasized Section 29 (3), Article VI of the
Constitution which provides:

“once the purpose for which a special fund was created has been fulfilled or 
abandoned, the balance, if any, shall be transferred to the general funds of the 
government.”

1.2. Further, DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 
was also issued which sets the rules and regulations implementing Executive 
Order no. 431 directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary 
special and trust funds to the general fund and other purposes.

1.3. In addition, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 prescribes the 
guidelines and procedures in the Reversion to the General Fund of all Dormant 
Cash, Unauthorized Accounts, Unnecessary Special and Trust Funds and 
Related Accounts.

1.4. It is also stated under the General Provisions of the Bangsamoro Appropriations 
Act for 2020, specifically Sec. 10 which states, “Reversion, Closure, and 
Transfer of Balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving 
Funds, and Unauthorized Accounts. Ministries and Offices are mandated to 
close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and 
Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) 
when there is no legal basis for its creation; ii) when their terms have expired; or 
(iii) when they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for 
which said funds were established.”

1.5. As of December 31, 2020, records of BHRC-BARMM based on the Report of 
Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) showed that the agency still 
maintains four (4) bank accounts which were noted to be inactive. These bank 
accounts are as follows:

Account Number Account Name
1 LBP 0372-1143-63 RHRC-Gen. Fund
2 LBP 0372-1148-43 Local Fund
3 LBP 0372-1143-71 AUSAID
4 LBP 0372-1143-47 UNHCR



21

1.6. The unused checks for all of the abovementioned accounts are still in the 
custody of the Cashier, thereby adding to her accountabilities despite the fact 
that these are already inactive since the purpose for which these accounts were 
established, the implementation of which have been completed or abandoned.

1.7. There is also the risk that these accountable forms might be used for purposes 
other than the one for which these were established.

1.8. Dormant accounts refer to collections authorized by law to be deposited with an 
AGDB but have remained inactive for more than five years, while unnecessary 
special and trust funds refer to authorized special and trust funds maintained by 
government agencies with AGDBs but which are no longer necessary for the 
attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established.

1.9. We recommended the following:

1.9.1. Make necessary analysis, review and reconciliation of the
abovementioned bank accounts.

1.9.2. Verify with the bank the status of the bank accounts based on 
agency’s record and to make necessary actions to close them when 
proven its purpose ceased to exist.

1.9.3. Revert the dormant cash, if any, to the general fund once the 
evaluation is done.

1.10. The Cashier commented that all the stated old RHRC accounts were already 
requested for closure accounts since year 2014. However, the supporting
documents like letter of request received by the Landbank of the Philippines 
were already forwarded to BHRC warehouse since it was more than three years 
ago. They would try their very best to retrieve those documents as soon as 
possible.

1.11. Moreover, the Local Fund (LF) account is the only remaining account that was
not requested for closure since they are expecting that the Office of the Chief 
Minister, BARMM (OCM-BARMM) will transfer funds to this account in 
support of the mandate of Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission. However, 
they were advised to change the account name. 

1.12. As a rejoinder, the Audit Team advised that the Cashier should request from 
LandBank the bank statements of all the abovementioned accounts in order to 
verify if these accounts were actually closed. And if ever these accounts were 
already closed, it is also advised that the remaining unused checks should be 
perforated or stamped “Cancelled” to avoid its further use.



22

2. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) balance amounting to P13,498,073.49 
could not be relied upon due to the failure of management to reconcile 
periodically the Accounting records and the Report of Physical Count of 
Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) provided under Section 42, Chapter 
10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM)

2.1. Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual also states that 
for check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 
maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt 
and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with the 
PPE Ledger Card maintained by the Accounting Division Division/Unit.

2.2. One of the internal control practices that management should adopt in order to 
safeguard its tangible assets is that records should be checked periodically 
through physical count and the total value should be balanced with the 
controlling account.

2.3. The Audit Team had requested and was furnished with a copy of the Report on
the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of 
December 31, 2020.

2.4. Upon verification or comparison with the acquisition cost in the financial 
statements, it was noted that there is an unreconciled difference amounting to
P1,508,224.70 as shown below:

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Particulars Per RPCPPE

Motor Vehicles 9,589,884.60 7,930,334.90 1,658,549.70
TOTAL 15,006,298.19 13,498,073.49 1,508,224.70

2.5. It was further noted that the RPCPPE was prepared and signed only by the 
Supply Officer instead of the Inventory Committee Chair and its members. The 
report also indicated that there are a lot of items that are already unserviceable
and needs to be disposed but were not yet disposed as of December 31, 2020. 
The cost of these items only add up to the unreliability in the balances of the
different types of PPE.



23

2.6. We recommended the following:

2.6.1. The Head of the Agency shall create an Inventory Committee
composed of adequate number of members to be able to conduct the
physical inventory and prepare the RPCPPE. Reconcile the data in 
the RPCPPE against the record of the Accounting.

2.6.2. For a One-Time cleansing of the PPE accounts please refer to COA 
Circular no. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 for the guidelines and 
procedures.

2.6.3. A Disposal Committee should also be created to take care of the items 
that need to be disposed.

2.7. Management commented that upon review, the unreconciled differences were
due to the following:

2.7.1. For the motor vehicles:
The Toyota Fortuner (3000 CC 1KD 6423636) amounting to 
Php1,613,549.70 was erroneously not recorded in the Accounting 
books. Thus, an adjusting entry to reflect the amount is needed to be 
recorded for this year in the books of the Accounting.

2.7.2. Php46,000 was refunded to the account of the office in November 2013 
from the purchase of RHRC Motor Vehicles. This was considered in 
the Accounting books but was not considered as a deduction from the 
cost of the motor vehicles in the books of the Supply Officer – the 
RCPPE. Thus, this should be reflected in the updated RCPPE.

2.7.3. Total amount of Adjustment (1,613,549.70+46,000.00) = 
Php1,659,549.70

2.7.4. For the furniture and fixtures:
The furniture and fixtures amounting to Php193,300.00 was 
erroneously not considered in the RCPPE. It should be included in the 
report of the Supply Officer because it was purchased in the year 2020.

2.7.5. For the ICT Equipment:
In December 2016, the unserviceable router amounting to Php7,980 and 
the other prior year adjustment (2015) amounting to Php32,500 was 
removed from the ICT Equipment Account and was recorded in the 
General Journal of the Accounting books. The total amount of 
adjustment was Php40,480.00. This needs to be checked if it also 
considered in the RCPPE prepared by the Supply Office



24

2.8. As an audit rejoinder, the Audit Team suggested that the agency record all these 
adjusting journal entries for the CY 2021 in order to have a more accurate 
account balances.

Gender and Development (GAD)

3. For the CY 2020, BHRC-BARMM has spent the amount of P5,779,832.00 for the
conduct of Gender & Development (GAD) related activities. This is almost 12%
of its actual budget for the said year amounting to P48,654,866.32, which is very
much in compliance with the requirements of R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta
of Women (MCW) and PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular no. 2012-01; Executive
Order (E.O.) No. 273; and the Bangsamoro Appropriations Act of 2020.

3.1. PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular no. 2012-01 prescribes the guidelines and
procedures for the formulation, development, submission, implementation, 
monitoring, and evaluation including accounting of results of agency annual 
GAD plans and budgets, and GAD accomplishment reports to implement the 
Magna Carta of Women.

3.2. Section 2.3 of the said circular states, “Pursuant to the MCW and the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA), all government departments, including their 
attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges (SUCs), 
government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local government 
units (LGUs) and other government instrumentalities shall formulate their 
annual GPBs within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender 
perspectives in their policies, programs and projects. GAD Planning shall be 
integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of implementation of 
which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budgets. The computation 
and utilization shall be implemented in accordance with the specific guidelines 
provided therein.”

3.3. E.O No. 273 entitled “Approving and Adapting the Philippine Plan for Gender 
Responsive Development from 1995-2025”, mandates agencies to 
institutionalize GAD efforts in the government by incorporating GAD concerns 
in their planning, programming and budgeting processes. It also directs agencies 
to incorporate and reflect GAD concerns in their annual budget proposals as 
well as in the work and financial plan.

3.4. In addition, the Bangsamoro Appropriations Act of 2020, specifically Section 
23 provides, “Sec. 23. Programs and Projects Related to Gender and 
Development. All Ministries and Offices of the Bangsamoro government shall 
formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender 
issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 
provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing 



25

Platform for Action, the Philippines Plan for Gender-Responsive Development 
(1995-2025), the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022), and other 
applicable laws and guidelines issued thereon.”

3.5. For CY 2020, BHRC prepared and submitted an annual GAD Plan and Budget 
amounting to P10,630,840.00 which is almost 22% of its annual budget. Of the 
amount budgeted, only P5,779,832.00 was actually spent based on the
submitted GAD Accomplishment Report.

3.6. The agency’s Annual GAD Accomplishment Report for 2020 is attached
herewith as Annex A.
