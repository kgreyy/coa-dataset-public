	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



The University of Eastern Philippines (UEP) is the first State University in the Visayas.  Its flagship campus is in Catarman, Northern Samar.  UEP began as the Catarman Farm School (CFS) in September 1918.  The CFS was later named Catarman Agricultural School (CAS), raising its status to Insular Provincial, and subsequently making it the Catarman Agricultural High School (CAHS).  In 1950, the school’s name was once more changed to Catarman National Agricultural High School (CNAHS) for its complete nationalization.  House Bill No. 6559 created the Samar Institute of Technology (SIT), which Pres. Carlos P. Garcia signed into RA No. 1434.  SIT was inaugurated on September 7, 1958.



On June 20, 1964, SIT was converted into the UEP through House Bill No. 4050.  UEP is mandated to "primarily give technical and professional training, advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and the arts, besides providing for the promotion of scientific and technological researches."



In 1999, the Pedro Rebadulla Memorial Agricultural College (PRMAC) and the Laoang National Trade School (LNTS), formerly CHED-supervised institutions, were integrated into the University.  Since then, they have been operating as UEP PRMAC Catubig Campus and UEP-Laoang Campus under the UEP System.



The audit of UEP covered review of the accounts and operations for Calendar Year (CY) 2020.  The audit was conducted to:  a) ascertain the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; b) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on the financial statements; and c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

C)	Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the UEP for CY 2020 due to exceptions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II of this Report as follows:



1)	Accounts Receivable aged over one year to eighteen years totaling P8,360,332.55 has remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020 due to the failure of Management to enforce its collection.  Likewise, no Allowance for Impairment Losses was provided for the account, thus affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.



2)	The year-end balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account totaling P831,919,159.50 is not fairly presented due to: a) the non-provision of depreciation of PPE items totaling P63,500,719.16; b) non-recording of received PPE donations; c) erroneous accounting entries made to record the procurement of construction materials for infrastructure projects; d) the inclusion in the books of unserviceable and fully depreciated properties; and e) the non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment as of December 31, 2020.



3)		The accuracy of the Land account with a reported balance of P116,916,017.48 in the financial statements cannot be ascertained due to: (a) non-recording of the acquisition costs of the asset at the UEP - Catubig Campus; (b) error in the recording of the donated land of UEP - Laoang Campus; and (c) failure of the UEP Catubig and Laoang Campuses to facilitate the transfer of land titles of purchased and donated land.

		

4)	The Biological Assets account balance amounting to P117,010.00 of the University as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to several deficiencies noted during the audit: a) the account balance has reported no changes since CY 2016; b) there has been no inventory reports submitted by the UEP - Catubig Campus; c) the biological assets reported in the inventory report submitted by UEP - Main Campus did not indicate any unit cost and total cost of the items in the list; d) the Biological Assets Property Card and Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card were not maintained and updated; and e) the Quarterly Report on Biological Assets has not been prepared and submitted



5)	Subsidiary Ledgers  are not maintained to support the General Ledger accounts totaling P206,016,994.49; disallowances totaling P119,977.01 have not been recorded in the books; various errors amounting to P23,966,386.61 have remained uncorrected; and, there are no adequate disclosures on the Notes to Financial Statements for accounts totaling P5,768,843.62, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.





D)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)	Breakdown in control over the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances has resulted in the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances totaling P3,603,464.59, which has been outstanding for over one year to 21 years, thereby exposing government funds to the risk of loss.



	We recommended that the President require the:



a)	personnel concerned to immediately liquidate their outstanding cash advances and henceforth, to submit liquidation documents within the prescribed period;



b)	Accountant to adopt stricter controls over the implementation of the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 96-004 dated April 19, 1996 as regards the monitoring and liquidation of cash advances, and the sanctions provided therein until such time when the AOs fully liquidate their cash advances;



c)	Accountant to request for the write-off of dormant cash advances, except for the cash advance of a disbursement officer who incurred shortage and was dismissed from service, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016;



a)		installation of more efficient internal control measures over the issuance of clearances for accountable officers who resign or retire from the University so that those with outstanding cash advances are obliged to settle obligations immediately and fully before their separation from the University.



2)	Payments of per diem to the Board of Regents (BOR) of UEP during board meetings in CYs 2018-2020 totaling P855,600.00 were erroneously charged against the Internally Generated Fund - Special Trust Fund instead of the General Appropriations Act, thus, depleting the fund which could have been utilized for instruction, research, extension, or similar programs or projects of the University.



	We recommended that the President require the:

	

a)		Budget Officer to stop charging to the IGF-STF the payments of per diem to the BOR, and instead properly charge it against the amount appropriated for the purpose in the GAA, and any deficiency shall be charged against the savings.

	

b)		Personnel concerned to refund the per diem they received for the period CY 2018-2020 totaling P855,600.00.

	

3)	Various supplies and materials totaling P1,071,921.80 were procured for infrastructure projects implemented by administration which were not supported with approved Program of Works, and were not included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP).  Various deficiencies were noted on completed infrastructure projects totaling P109,708,282.74, while projects totaling P249,752,043.72 were implemented without the requisite building permits.

	

	We recommended that the President require the:



a)	PPDO to:



(i) submit the POWs of all infrastructure projects implemented by administration in CY 2020; and henceforth, meticulously prepare POWs for all infrastructure projects of the University



(ii) demand that the contractors correct the defects noted for the infrastructure projects; and henceforth ensure that the contractors completely implement the projects based on the POW, and submit the necessary approved building permits before the commencement of a project.



(iii) closely monitor and supervise the implementation of all infrastucture projects, whether these are undertaken by contract or by administration to safeguard government funds and resources.



a)		BAC Secretariat to prepare a complete APP which will include all the infrastructures projects to be implemented either by administration or by public bidding during the year so that adequate planning could be adopted. 



4)	The approved Special Budget totaling P96,498,130.00 and its augmentation totaling P9,050,000.00 were not supported with an APP and Project Procurement Management Plans duly approved by the BOR.



We recommended that the President ensure that proposed budgets and augmentations are supported with APP and PPMPs, when applicable.  Further, we recommended that the President direct:



a)	all end-user units to prepare their PPMPs, incorporating therein all their procurement requirements for the year;



b)	the BAC Secretariat to consolidate the PPMPs into a comprehensive, workable and realistic APP for approval by the HoPE and the BOR, as basis of procurement for the year;



c)	Budget Officer to duly evaluate and review the PPMPs of the end-user units; support the budget with an APP and PPMPs; and strictly observe planning and budgeting linkage with other persons concerned; and



d)	the Supply Office to undertake the procurement of all requirements for the year based on the approved APP in accordance with RA No. 9184.

	

5)	Funds totaling P9,050,000.00 taken from the balances reported in the bank statements as at year end were used to augment the CY 2020 Special Budget.



	We recommended that the President direct the Budget Officer to submit evidence of the source of the P9,050,000.00 which was used to augment the CY 2020 Special Budget; and to prepare and maintain the necessary registries so that the monitoring of the budget and its subsequent expenditures is made easier in compliance with Section 3 of the GAM for NGAS.



	We recommended that the Budget Officer issue a certification to support the augmentation of budgets that fund sources are free of any obligation or encumbrances, and no longer intended for specific purpose.

	

6)	Modifications made in the allocation for the Research and the Extension Services in CY 2020 Special Budget exceeded the limits which affected the implementation of the programs and projects for the school year.



We recommended that the President direct the Budget Officer to restore the budgeted funds for both Research and Extention Services, and henceforth strictly observe the provisions of CMO No. 20, Series of 2011 relative to the specific budget allocations for each of the programs identified so that the efficient operations of the University is assured

	

7)	The Registries of Budget, Utilization and Disbursements were not maintained, and the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports pertaining to the Special Budget were not submitted, hence, the fund balances at a given period could not be ascertained.



	We recommended that the President direct the Budget Officer to:

	

a)		submit the required BFARs for the CY 2020 Special Budget; and



b)		prepare and maintain the necessary registries for the Special Budget to enable a more efficient evaluation of the utilization of the Fund.



8)	The University failed to create, organize and operate an Internal Audit Service Office, thereby affecting its efficient and effective fiscal administration and performance of its affairs and functions.



	We recommended that the President create, organize and operate an Internal Audit Service in accordance with RA No. 3456, Administrative Order No. 278 dated April 28, 1992, and the revised PGIAM.



The above audit observations and recommendations were communicated to management through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) and their comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.
