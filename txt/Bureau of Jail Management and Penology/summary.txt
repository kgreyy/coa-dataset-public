The audit covered the accounts of BJMP-NHQ and its 17 ROs nationwide for CY 2020 to ascertain the propriety of disbursements, the reliability of financial statements (FS) and the adequacy of the books of accounts.  However, results of the audit of transactions and operations of BJMP RO No. VIII was not included in this report due to non-submission of the Management Letter as of April 30, 2021.



D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



The Auditor rendered an Unmodified Opinion on the fairness of the presentation of FS of BJMP as of December 31, 2020.



E)	Summary of Observations and Recommendations



1)	The balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account amounting to P6,412.540.052.11 as at year-end is unreliable due to: (a) noted difference of P150,744,589.62 between the accounting records and property records for PPE; (b) unrecorded 45 parcels of land acquired through donation due to absence of assigned value; and (c) non-reclassification of completed projects totaling P125,332,665.90 to the appropriate PPE accounts.  Moreover, the titling of 94 donated parcels of land in the name of the Bureau has not yet been initiated or completed; thus, absolute ownership thereof is doubtful. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management (a) direct the concerned Regional Supply Accountable Officers (RSAO) and the Accountants to determine the cause/s for the unreconciled balances and conduct regular reconciliation of records and effect necessary adjustments thereon; (b) instruct the Regional Accountant of BJMP RO Nos. II, IV- A and IV-B to determine and recognize the value of donated parcels of land in the books, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 and 11 of Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I; (c) instruct the concerned Regional Directors and the Regional Logistics Officers to identify and address all issues that is causing delay and exhaust all means to facilitate immediate transfer of the parcels of land in BJMP’s name; (d) disclose in the notes to FS the details of all donated lots as well as the improvements introduced thereon; and (e) direct the concerned Regional Accountants to reclassify completed projects to its appropriate PPE account and provide depreciation thereof pursuant to Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I.    

 

2)	Jail facilities already completed or undergoing construction in NCR and RO I were constructed in a parcel of land for which the BJMP has no record of absolute ownership; thus, may result to loss of properties/resources in the event that future claim of ownership or right is presented by third parties. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management (a) on the basis of the Presidential Proclamations, BJMP NCR obtain Patent and Original Certificate of Title (OCT) thru administrative proceedings from the Bureau of Lands and the Register of Deeds to process and complete documents for the parcels of land located in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City where various jail facilities are situated, in favor of the Bureau; and  (b) RO I Logistics Division secure Deed of Donation from the Local Government of San Carlos City, Pangasinan and prioritize the transfer of ownership in the name of BJMP.



3)	The balance of the Cash in Bank – Local, Currency Account amounting to P36,161,546.63 as at year end is misstated by P28,654.25 due to non-reversion to the cash accounts of unreleased check amounting to P23,294.25 and stale checks totaling P5,360.00 in view of the: (i) non-preparation of schedule of unreleased check; and (ii) non-cancellation of stale checks.  Moreover, preparation and submission of monthly bank reconciliation statements was delayed, contrary to the pertinent provisions of the GAM Volume I. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a) Finance Section of RO XI to prepare schedule of unreleased checks as at year-end and submit the same to the Accounting Unit for recording; (b) Regional Accountant of ROs IV-A and XI to restore and record the  unreleased and stale checks as at year-end to its appropriate cash account; and (c) Regional Accountant of ROs CAR, II, IV-B and XI to expedite the preparation of BRS and submit the same to the auditor for verification and audit.



4)	Receipt and utilization of Covid-19 Funds were in accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) Nos. 11469 and 11494 also known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act as well as with Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020, respectively. (Observation No. 4)

	

We commended the Management’s adherence to the Bayanihan Acts and Administrative Order No. 26 and recommended that BJMP Management continue to adhere to the provisions of the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act and other Covid-related provisions.

	

5)	Existing regulations governing loss of government property were not strictly observed by the concerned Accountable Officer contrary to Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Section 73 of PD 1445; thus, notice of loss/request for relief from property accountability is either not filed or filed way beyond the reglementary period of 30 days. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management require (a) All accountable officers (AOs): (i) in case of loss of government property, file the basic Notice of Loss immediately to the Office of the Auditor and apply for  relief from property accountability within 30 days from occurrence of the loss by submitting the required documents provided in COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992; and (ii) furnish the Accounting Unit of the copy of the Notice of Loss together with the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) so that the value of the lost properties will be dropped from the books of accounts.; (b) Supply Accountable Officers (SAO) to: (i) exclude the lost property from the RPCPPE as well as in the respective Property Card (PC); and (ii) closely monitor the immediate filing of Notice of Loss and/or require the concerned AO to file request for relief from property accountability and remind them of possible liabilities or charges in the future for failing to comply with the requirements due to negligence.; and (c)  Regional and Chief Accountant to derecognize the lost properties from the books of accounts and set-up the receivable account upon receipt of RSLDDP.



6)	The delayed completion of 29 infrastructure projects with total contract cost of P2,302,773,885.04 hampered BJMP’s objective of providing a functional and responsive jail facility to PDLs contrary to Section 63 of RA 6975.  Moreover, (a) four infrastructure projects with total contract cost of P56,237,630.03 were terminated in RO Nos. V and XII due to contractors’ incapacity; (b) non-utilization of 14 fully completed jail facilities in ROs III and IV-A; and (c) non-imposition of liquidated damages (LD) in RO Nos. V, IX, XII and BARMM. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the (a) Regional Engineers  and TWG to meticulously plan the details of the projects in an efficient and effective manner to ensure proper impementation, timely completion and immediate utilization of all infrasturcture projects; (b) Regional BAC and TWG to strictly and properly check technical and financial capability of contractors prior to award to ensure their full compliance to stipulations in the contract;  (c) Regional Engineers and Regional Logistics Division to properly supervise and monitor implementation/construction of all on-going infrastructure projects and enforce contract stipulations in the completion of the project within the agreed period and/or time specified in the contract; (d) Regional Directors to ensure that contract extension shall be granted only on conditions provided under Annex E of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184; (e) ROs concerned to evaluate all on-going infrastructure projects and consider termination of contract pursuant to (i) GPPB Resolution No. 05-2019 dated March 8, 2019 and the 2016 Revised IRR and (ii) the provisions in the general and special conditions of the contract, without prejudice to the suspension; blacklisting, and/or filing of appropriate charges against the erring contractors; (f) R.O. Nos. III and IV-A expedite installation of electricity and perimeter fences pertaining to 14 newly-completed jail facilities necessary for their immediate utilization; and (g) Regional Accountants to (i) assess and/or initiate computation of liquidated damages or forfeit performance security, if warranted, on contracts with delayed implementation; and (ii) demand from contractors the unpaid LDs and/or deduct from their claims the correctly computed LDs.



7)	The total jail population of 115,336 as of December 31, 2020 exceeded the total ideal capacity of 34,893 with a variance of 80,443 or a total average occupancy rate of 403 percent, precluding the Agency in attaining its objectives of: (a) improving the living conditions of inmates in accordance with the accepted standards set by the United Nations; and (b) enhancing the safekeeping and development of inmates in preparation for their eventual reintegration into the mainstream of the society upon their release due to unhealthy environment affecting the morale and health conditions of Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDL) contrary to Rule 10 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended that Management (a) include in its budget appropriation a provision for capital outlay for the purchase of lots and/or construction of additional jail facilities to address the continued and increasing jail population; (b) continue its effort making representations with different LGUs and other NGAs for possible lot donations and/or construction/expansion of jail facilities giving priority to those extremely crowded jail facilities; (c) instruct the Regional Directors to (i) impose the provisions/stipulations in the general and special conditions of the contract specifically on the construction schedule and project; and (ii) enforce provisions/stipulations in the MOA subject of the transferred funds to LGUs specifically on the approved scope of works and construction schedule ; and (d) enhance and intensify the GCTA process and give more emphasis on the Recognizance Act for detainees' early release without necessarily completing their sentence which could significantly reduce jail population and congestion.



8)	The BJMP NHQ and its nine ROs allocated funds and implemented programs and projects related to Gender and Development (GAD).   However, in ROs IV-B, V, IX, X, XI and BARMM there was insufficient fund allocation, deficient and/or unsubmitted/delayed submission of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report (AR), contrary to Section 31 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465 or GAA of FY 2020. (Observation No. 8)

	

We recommended that Management require: (a) RO V to allocate and utilize at least five percent of the agency’s  appropriations for implementation of GAD related programs, projects and activities; (b) RO IV-B to submit the GPB and AR to BJMP NHQ for its review and/or consolidation and secure copy of reviewed reports; (c) ROs IX and XI to require the GAD Focal Person to accomplish the GPB and GAD AR in accordance with PCW-NEDA-DMB Joint Circular 2012-01 Annexes A and B, respectively; (d) RO IX to designate a Regional GAD Representative (Focal Person) that is not regularly subjected to reassignment to ensure longevity in carrying out the duties and responsibilities needed for the RO’s GAD program and initiate the provision of training and continuous technical assistance to the GAD Focal Person relating to his function; and (e) ROs X, XI and BARMM to submit Annual GPB and AR within the prescribed period after its approval by the NHQ.
