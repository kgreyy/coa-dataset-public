PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL AUDIT



Unreliable Balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account 



1)	The balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment account amounting to P6,412.540.052.11 as at year-end is unreliable due to: (a) noted difference of P150,744,589.62 between the accounting records and property records for PPE; (b) unrecorded 45 parcels of land acquired through donation due to absence of assigned value; and (c) non-reclassification of completed projects totaling P125,332,665.90 to the appropriate PPE accounts.  Moreover, the titling of 94 donated parcels of land in the name of the Bureau has not yet been initiated or completed; thus, absolute ownership thereof is doubtful. 



a)	Non-reconciliation of accounting and property records 



	1)	As at December 31, 2020, the PPE balances recorded in the books totaled to P6,412,540,052.11, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, details are as follow:

	8)	Section 11 Chapter 10, GAM Volume I provides that: PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction (NET) such as donation in this case shall be measured at fair value (FV) on the date of acquisition.  If the FV cannot be determined, the asset shall be recorded at a nominal value (the value that is stated on currency or face value).



	9)	The discrepancies between the Accounting and Property records, as well as the unrecorded parcels of land due to absence of assigned value affect the fair presentation of the Agency’s FS in contravention of Section 15, Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I which states that FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transaction, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs.



	10)	We recommended that Management:



a)	direct the concerned Regional Supply Accountable Officers (RSAO) and Accountants to determine the cause/s of the unreconciled balances and conduct regular reconciliation of records and effect necessary adjustments thereon; and



b)	instruct the Regional Accountant of BJMP R.O. Nos. II, IV- A and IV-B to determine and recognize the value of donated parcels of land in the books, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 and 11 of Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I.







	11)	Management commented that:



a)	The Offices of the Regional Accountant and RSAO are currently reconciling their records.  Close coordination and monitoring are being done in BJMP NHQ to facilitate immediate completion of reconciliation.



b)	In R.O. IV-A, the RSAO and the Accountant reconciled and prepared the necessary adjustments needed to put the RPCPPE and Accounting records in agreement under JEV No. 21-04-0098.



c)	In R.O. V, the RSAO revised its RPCPPE to properly include Other Structures amounting to P3,552,556.35.  JEV#21-04-045 dated 01 April 2021 was prepared to take up Communication Equipment amounting to P99,494.52 in the books of accounts. Other adjustments were made per JEV# 21-03-027 dated March 1, 2021 to reconcile other discrepancies. The Regional Accountant and the RSAO commit to continually reconcile their records. 



d)	R.O. CAR RSAO revised and re-submitted the RPCPPE and the Regional Accountant made the necessary adjustments under JEV No. 21-04-035 dated April 01, 2021.  The Regional Accountant and the RSAO commit to continually reconcile their records. 



e)	R.O. XIII Regional Accountant recorded the receipt of the property from the NHQ under JEV Nos. 20-12-932 to 934 all dated December 31,2020; transfer of property under JEV No. 20-12-935; transfer to R.O. IV-B under JEV No. 20-12-936; transfer to R.O. XI under JEV 20-12-937; transfer to RO XII under JEV 20-12-938. On the other hand, RSAO will revise the RPCPPE to include Land, Buildings, and Other Structures amounting to P113,302,105.79.  One unit laptop and one personal computer are yet to be recorded upon receipt of the required documentation from DPWH.



f)	BJMP-NHQ determined that the variance in the amount of P619,816.26 was due to unserviceable properties which were not reflected in the RPCPPE but recorded in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP).



g)	The Regional Accountant of BJMP R.O. Nos. II, IV-A and IV-B will coordinate with the Legal Division before the recognition and recording in the books of the untitled lands.



h)	In R.O. IV-A, the Regional Accountant, upon receipt of the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) from the BIR and Tax Declaration of Real Property from the Municipal Assessor, recorded the donated lot where the Gumaca District Jail is located, at its fair market value under JEV No. 21-04-0103.  The remaining unrecorded 17 donated parcels of land will be recorded upon completion of the documents necessary for their recognition in the books. 



(c) Non-titling of 94 donated parcels of land



	12)	BJMP R.O. Nos. II, III, IV-A, IV-B and VI failed to initiate and/or complete the titling of 94 donated parcels of land in the name of BJMP with a total area of 337,191.90 sq.m., located in their respective regions, where various jail facilities are constructed, rendering the ownership thereof doubtful which may expose the same to the risk of loss in case of third party claims:

	13)	Except for R.O. Nos. II, IV-A and IV-B, donated parcels of land in R.O. Nos. III and VI are recorded in the books. 

 

	14)	We recommended that Management:



a)	instruct the concerned Regional Directors and the Regional Logistics Officers to identify and address all issues that are causing delay and exhaust all means to facilitate immediate transfer of the parcels of land in BJMP’s name; and



b)	disclose in the notes to FS the details of all donated lots as well as the improvements introduced thereon.



	15)	 Management commented that:



	a)		BJMP R.O. II explained that the titling of 14 lots is already on process and that they will exert all efforts to fast track the same. 

	

	b)		BJMP R.O. III averred that they will facilitate the titling of the seven lots by coordinating with concerned LGUs for completion of documentary requirements. 



	c)		BJMP R.O. IV-A Management conducted zoom meeting on April 17, 2021 with Jail Wardens of jail facilities relative to the 18 parcels of land to identify and address cause of delays in titling and reiterated the step-by-step procedure provided in the Memorandum dated June 16, 2020 to concerned personnel liaising with the Assessor’s Office and Registry of Deeds.  In addition, the Regional Logistics Office and Legal Officer coordinated and discussed with the Chief Registry of Deeds of Quezon Province for facilitation of the completion of requirements in the titling of parcels of land located in the Province in favor of BJMP.



	d)		BJMP R.O. IV-B already sent a Memorandum dated April 27, 2020 to field units regarding guidelines in the titling of all donated lots. However, the limited number of Geodetic Engineer or Surveyor in the provinces of MIMAROPA hampers the procedures in lot titling. Nevertheless, the Management will direct all Jail Wardens to coordinate with Assessor’s Office or Engineering Department in their respective area for another option to fast track the process in lot titling.

	

	e)		BJMP R.O. VI Logistics Division issued a Memorandum to Jail Units concerned to process all documents to substantiate ownership of lots. Likewise, on March 9, 2021 deeds of donation were submitted to Register of Deeds and inquiry was made as to the supporting documents in processing of title.



Non-reclassification of completed projects to appropriate PPEs accounts 



	16)	Chapter 10, Section 8, item (g) of the GAM, Volume I on Construction of PPE states that: x   x   x. As soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be capitalized.



	17)	Verification of the Construction in Progress (CIP) account in ROs II; IV-B; and VII disclosed that various completed projects were still included under the CIP account and were not reclassified to its appropriate PPE account as of December 31, 2020. Details are as follows:

	18)	The non-reclassification of completed projects from CIP account to its appropriate asset account is not in accordance with the provisions set in Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. This resulted in the overstatement of the CIP account and the understatement of Other Structures account both by P125,332,665.90 as well as misstatements of other affected accounts such as the Depreciation Expense – Other Structures and the Accumulated Depreciation – Other Structures account.



	19)	We recommended that Management direct the concerned Regional Accountants to reclassify completed projects to its appropriate PPE account and provide depreciation thereof pursuant to Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I.    



	20)	To fairly present the PPE accounts in the Notes to FS, the Chief Accountant reclassified the completed projects to Buildings and Other Structures account.



	21)	Management commented that:



a)	BJMP R.O. II RA reclassified the completed projects to its appropriate PPE account under JEV No. 21-02-018 dated February 20, 2021.

	

b)		BJMP R.O. IV-B RA reclassified the completed projects to its appropriate PPE account under JEV No. 2021-01-0002 dated January 21, 2021 and JEV No. 2021-04-0033 dated April 21, 2021.



c)		BJMP R.O. VII Accounting Unit has already booked up the completed projects to its proper PPE account. The concerned completed projects namely; Balamban and Vallehermoso Municipal jail buildings were properly recorded and reclassified from CIP to Building account under JEV 2021-001-008 dated January 15, 2021. The corresponding depreciation expenses were properly recorded starting January 2021.

	

2)	Jail facilities already completed or undergoing construction in NCR and R.O. I were constructed in a parcel of land for which the BJMP has no record of absolute ownership; thus, may result to loss of properties/resources in the event that future claim of ownership or right is presented by third parties.   



	1)	BJMP NCR and R.O. I have various jail facilities already completed or undergoing construction which are done in a parcel of land for which BJMP has no record of absolute ownership; thus, may result to loss of properties/ resources in the event that future claim of ownership or right is presented by third parties.  Details are as follows:

	2)	In NCR, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered into on March 20, 1996 and executed by and between the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) represented by then Secretary Rafael M. Alunan III and Public Estates Authority (PEA) represented by then General Manager Amado S. Lagdameo, Jr., provides the following:



Section 1. Upon signing of this Agreement, the DILG shall direct authorize and charge the PNP, in coordination with PEA and BJMP, to select, specify, segregate and provide a suitable area in Camp R. Papa in Bicutan, Taguig Metro Manila, to serve as the site for the permanent jail to replace the City Jail of Manila and for the temporary detention facilities if needed;



Section 2. Within sixy (60) days from execution of this Agreement, the DILG and PEA shall agree in writing as to the specific land areas and location within Camp R. Papa where the aforesaid temporary detention facility and permanent jail shall be situated in acccordance with the agreement reached among PNP, PEA and BJMP pursuant to Section 1 hereof;



Section 3. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 and 7 of this Agreement, the DILG shall direct, authorize and charged the BJMP to perfom the following:



3.1 Transfer and relocate the City Jail of Manila, including its inmates/prisoners, initially to the temporary detention facility and, thereafter, to the permanent jail at Camp R. Papa as soon as these facilities are operational and ready for occupancy;



3.2 Provide whatever personnel and forces as may be needed to secure and guard the detainees/prisoners while being transferred from the Manila City Jail;



3.3 The PNP shall provide additional personnel and forces as may be needed, upon request of the BJMP to secure and guard the detainees/prisoners while being transferred from the Manila City Jail.



xxxxx



	3)	Moreover, a Supplemental Agreement was made and executed on June 21, 1996 by and between the DILG represented by then Secretary Robert Z. Barbers and Public Estates Authority (PEA) represented by then General Manager Arsenio B. Yulo, Jr., states the following:



Whereas in a Memorandum of Agreement dated March 20, 1996, DILG and PEA agreed, among others, that the DILG/PNP shall provide as suitable area in Camp R. Papa, Bicutan Taguig, Metro manila where the Manila City Jail shall be transferred and relocated without, however, specifying the metes and bounds thereof;



Whereas, there is a need to delineate clearly the metes and bounds of the area where the new Manila City Jail shall be relocated;



NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, the parties have agreed as follows:



1)	DILG segregates from Camp R. Papa, Bicutan, Taguig, Metro Manila and grants unto PEA two (2) parcels of land with aggregate area of 58,631.11 sq.m., more or less, designated as Lot-1-a and Lot-1-b and more particularly described in the attched Annexes “A” and “B” and made integral parts hereof, to be used as the relocation site of the Manila City Jail.



2)	DILG authorizes PEA, its representatives, agents, contractors and assigns to put monuments on the boundaries of said parcels of land and in general to undertake, construct, build, develop and introduce any and all improvements on said properties which are necessary, desirable or useful for the jail and detention facilities for the City of Manila.



3)	DILG likewise grants PEA,  as well as the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), their successors-in-interest and assigns, a perpetual easement of right-of-way to and from said parccels of land through the existing and/or future roads at Camp R. Papa, Bicutan, Taguig, Metro Manila.”



	4)	The afore-mentioned MOAs were executed for the purpose of developing the Old Bilibid Prison Compound (OBPC) and to facilitate the transfer and relocation of the City Jail of Manila, including its inmates/prisoners, initially to the temporary detention facility and, thereafter, to the permanent jail at Camp R. Papa, Bicutan, Taguig. 



	5)	In BJMP R.O. I, the absolute ownership of the donated lot where San Carlos City Jail is situated cannot be established due to the absence of the Deed of Donation; thus, the indicator of control for recognition purposes is lacking.



	6)	We recommended that: 



a)	on the basis of the Presidential Proclamations, BJMP NCR obtain Patent and Original Certificate of Title (OCT) thru administrative proceedings from the Bureau of Lands and the Register of Deeds to process and complete documents for the parcels of land located in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City where various jail facilities are situated, in favor of the Bureau; and 



b)	R.O. I Logistics Division secure Deed of Donation from the Local Government of San Carlos City, Pangasinan and prioritize the transfer of ownership in the name of BJMP.



	7)	Management commented the following:



a)	In NCR, Management explained that there are three ongoing BJMP infrastructure projects at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City and presently has nine jail facilities in operation which includes the Regional Quarantine Facility and Satellite Treatment Center. Hence, losing possession of the subject land would immensely affect the overall operation of these existing facilities as well as on-going infrastructure projects.



Management added that they have requested the NHQ to endorse to the DILG Secretary the request for issuance of a Presidential Proclamation in favor of the Bureau relative to the parcels of land occupied by the Bureau inside Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City 



Management further commented that they will take all essential steps to ensure ownership of the subject lots where various jail facilities are erected.



b)	R.O. I Management has coordinated with City Government of San Carlos, Pangasinan and will secure Deed of Donation for the transfer in favor of the BJMP.



3)	The balance of the Cash in Bank – Local, Currency Account amounting to P36,161,546.63 as at year end is misstated by P28,654.25 due to non-reversion to the cash accounts of unreleased check amounting to P23,294.25 and stale checks totaling P5,360.00 in view of the: (i) non-preparation of schedule of unreleased check; and (ii) non-cancellation of stale checks. Moreover, preparation and submission of monthly bank reconciliation statements was delayed, contrary to the pertinent provisions of the GAM Volume I.



1)	

	1)	Section 56, Chapter 19 of Volume I of GAM provides that a schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit and all unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to cash accounts.



	2)	On the other hand, Section 44 of Chapter 6 of Volume I of GAM provides that commercial checks may be cancelled when they became stale, voided or spoiled and that the depository bank consider a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over three months from date of issued.



	3)	Moreover, Chapter 21 of Volume I of GAM requires the preparation of bank reconciliation statements for cash in bank accounts including the proposed adjusting journal entries within ten days from the receipt of the monthly bank statements together with the paid checks, orignal copies of debit and credit memoranda.



	4)	In R.O. XI, audit disclosed that there was an unreleased check as at December 31, 2020 covering payment for Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable amounting to P23,294.25 which was subsequently released for payment on January 5, 2021.

	7)	In ROs CAR, II, IV-B and XI, Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period contrary to Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of Volume I of the GAM. 



	8)	ROs CAR, II, IV-B and XI explained that they were not able to prepare the BRS on a timely manner because concerned depository banks failed to provide the bank statements or even their snapshots due to the imposed quarantine restrictions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



	a)	Finance Section of RO XI to prepare schedule of unreleased checks as at year-end and submit the same to the Accounting Unit for recording;



	b)	Regional Accountant of ROs IV-A and XI to restore and record the unreleased and stale checks as at year-end to its appropriate cash account; and



	c)	Regional Accountant of ROs CAR, II, IV-B and XI to expedite the preparation of BRS and submit the same to the auditor for verification and audit.



	10)	Management commented the following:



	a)	RO IV-A Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendation to review reconciling items in the BRS and examine items that have been outstanding for more than 30 days.  The Regional Accountant made the necessary adjustments to record the stale check per JEV No. 21-02-0041.



	b)	ROs IV-B and CAR Management attributed the late preparation and submission of BRS to the delayed issuance of bank statements (BS) by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP). Management of RO IV-B already sent letter request for copies of BS while CAR will henceforth ensure that they prepare and submit the BRS on time.



	c)	RO II Regional Accountant completed the submission of BRS for CY 2020 and commits to the timely submission of the BRS in CY 2021.



	d)	RO XI Regional Accountant already prepared and submitted all BRS for CY 2020 and commits to prepare and submit all BRS as required on a timely manner. The Management further commits to submit the required list of unreleased checks for CY 2021 and the years thereafter.  JEV #20-12-0295 dated December 30, 2020 was made to take up the unreleased checks as at year-end.







COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Receipt and Utilization of Covid-19 Funds 



4)	Receipt and utilization of Covid-19 Funds were in accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) Nos. 11469 and 11494 also known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act as well as with Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020, respectively.



	1)	The effects brought about by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic to the health, safety, security and livelihood of the Filipinos became a driving force to declare a state of national emergency to enable government agencies to reprogram, realign or reallocate government funds to mitigate, if not contain, the transmission of Covid-19. 



	2)	While certain amount of leniency is allowed to expedite efforts to respond to challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, government transactions should remain properly accounted for. Information on the funds and their use should be reliable, accurate and transparent to enhance accountability.



	3)	R.A. No. 11469 also known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act was approved by the President on March 24, 2020 and effective until June 25, 2020 granting the President additional authority to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in the Philippines.



	4)	Further, in view of the need for sustained Covid-19 response and recovery interventions by the government, R.A. No. 11494 also known as the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act was also approved on September 11, 2020, effective to date.



	5)	BJMP Jail Officers, Non-Uniformed Personnel as well as PDLs were no exception to the risks and effects of the outbreak of Covid-19. As such, health protocols and lock-downs were being implemented during this pandemic season to eliminate, if not contain, the transmission of Covid-19 in the NHQ, ROs and jail facilities under its jurisdiction.



	6)	In view of this, BJMP has received a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) amounting to P11,093,000.00 from DBM on April 1, 2020 and further realigned regular funds in the total amount of P389,089,376.31 for the procurement of various supplies and equipment necessary for the prevention/mitigation of Covid-19.

	7)	Moreover, in compliance with AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 on the granting of Covid-19 Hazard Pay to government personnel who physically reported for work during the period of implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) relative to COVID-19 outbreak, the BJMP-NHQ has disbursed P467,307,000.00 for the payment of hazard pay of 14,863 qualified BJMP personnel.



	8)	We commended the Management’s adherence to the Bayanihan Acts and Administrative Order No. 26 and recommended that BJMP Management continue to adhere to the provisions of the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act and other Covid-related provisions.



	9)	Based on the audit work performed, we found that the receipt and utilization of Covid-19 Funds of the BJMP NHQ, NCR and R.O. VI is compliant, in all material aspects, with the provisions of RA Nos. 11469 and 11494 also known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, respectively and AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020.



	10)	Management commented that the commendation exemplifies the Bureau’s commitment to excel in the implementation of its financial system and to perform at its best in rendering jail services to its clientele while ensuring the prudent, transparent and accountable utilization of public funds.



	11)	Management further commits that highest accounting standards will be maintained in the system and uphold their service pledge to guard the purse by continuously adhering to requirements and provisions of existing auditing rules and regulations.









Loss of government property 



5)	Existing regulations governing loss of government property were not strictly observed by the concerned Accountable Officer contrary to Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Section 73 of PD 1445; thus, notice of loss/request for relief from property accountability is either not filed or filed way beyond the reglementary period of 30 days.  



1)	

2)	

	1)	Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides for the accounting policies on loss of property which require the preparation of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) supported by a Notice of Loss in order that lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss can be derecognized in the books of accounts.



	2)	Section 73 (1) of P.D. 1445 specifically states that:



When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts.” (Emphasis supplied)



	3)	In addition, Section 105 (1) thereof provides that:  



Every officer accountable for government property shall be liable for its money value in case of improper or unauthorized use or misapplication by himself or any person whose acts he may be responsible.  He shall likewise be liable for all losses, damages or deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping or use of the property whether or not it be at the time in his actual custody.” (Emphasis supplied)



	4)	Moreover, BJMP Standard Operating Procedure No. BJMP-LSO-SOP-25 dated December 28, 2018 prescribes the policies, responsibilities and penalties in the proper safekeeping and maintenance of government issued firearms. 



	5)	Review of procedures undertaken in NHQ and NCR in case of lost firearms disclosed that Notice of Loss as well as the corresponding request for relief from property accountability for lost firearms were not filed at the Office of the Auditor contrary to the above-mentioned regulations.



	6)	In NHQ, review of records disclosed that there were two firearms reported as lost of which Notice of Loss as well as the corresponding request for relief from property accountability for lost firearms were not filed at the Office of the Auditor, as follows:

	7)	In NCR, evaluation of requests for relief from property accountability submitted to the Office of the Auditor revealed that all were reported ranging from seven to 14 years delayed, way beyond the reglementary period of 30 days. Details are as follows:

	8)	Further evaluation revealed that the submitted documents were incomplete and lacked some of the required documents in COA Memorandum No. 92-751. Among other lacking documents, all requests were not supported by satisfactory explanations on the delay of filing of the Notices of Loss.



	9)	Non-submission of complete and necessary requirements hindered the Audit Team from evaluating the extent of liability or charges of the concerned AO who may be liable in case of negligence; thus, an officer who fails to comply with the prescribed requirements shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts.



	10)	We recommended that Management require:



a)	all Accountable Officers (AOs) to:



i)	in case of loss of government property, file the basic Notice of Loss immediately to the Office of the Auditor and apply for relief from property accountability within 30 days from occurrence of the loss by submitting the required documents provided in COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992; and



ii)	furnish the Accounting Unit of the copy of the Notice of Loss together with the RLSDDP so that the value of the lost properties will be dropped from the books of accounts.



b)	Supply Accountable Officer (SAO) to: 



i)	exclude the lost property from the RPCPPE as well as in the respective Property Card (PC); and



ii)	closely monitor the immediate filing of Notice of Loss and/or require the concerned AO to file request for relief from property accountability and remind them of possible liabilities or charges in the future for failing to comply with the requirements due to negligence. 



c)	Regional and Chief Accountant to derecognize lost properties from the books of accounts and set-up a receivable from concerned AO upon receipt of RSLDDP.



	11)	Management commented the following:



a)	The Supply Accountable Officer (SAO) was directed to remind all AOs through the Regional SAO, to immediately file a Notice of Loss to the Office of the Auditor and to request for relief from property accountability in accordance with COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992, and to provide the Accounting Unit (AU) such notice together with the RLSDDP for the adjustment  in the books of accounts.



b)	Management further instructed the SAO to closely monitor the filing of Notice of Loss as well as the corresponding Request for Relief from Property Accountability and the subsequent exclusion of the lost property from the Report on Physical Count of Property and to submit status of lost firearms to the Directorate for Investigation and Prosecution Office and Legal Services Office for their appropriate action/resolution



c)	To strengthen accountability of BJMP officers and employees, a memorandum was issued reiterating strict compliance to Standard Operating Procedures No. BJMP-LSO-SOP-25 and COA rules and regulations on lost firearms. Said memorandum encourages the inclusion in the personnel information and education activity the dissemination of the existing policies, rules and regulations regarding issued firearms and AO’s obligation and liability in case of loss as well as the required submission of quarterly status report on lost firearms.



d)	Management will hold a capacity building webinar to be participated in by the Regional Chiefs of Logistics Division and Regional SAO on existing processes and procedures as well as rules and regulations relating to lost firearms and request for relief from property accountability.





Status of Infrastructure Projects 



6)	The delayed completion of 29 infrastructure projects with total contract cost of P2,302,773,885.04 hampered BJMP’s objective of providing a functional and responsive jail facility to PDLs contrary to Section 63 of R.A. 6975. Moreover, (a) four infrastructure projects with total contract cost of P56,237,630.03 were terminated in R.O. Nos. V and XII due to contractors’ incapacity; (b) non-utilization of 14 fully completed jail facilities in R.O. Nos. III and IV-A; and (c) non-imposition of liquidated damages (LD) in R.O. Nos. V, IX, XII and BARMM.



1)	

2)	

	1)	Section 63 of R.A. No. 6975 elucidates the BJMP mandate as follows: 



There shall be established and maintained in every district, city and municipality a secured, clean adequately equipped and sanitary jail for the custody and safekeeping of city and municipal prisoners, any fugitive from justice, or person detained awaiting investigation or trial and/or transfer to the national penitentiary, and/or violent mentally ill person who endangers himself or the safety of others, duly certified as such by the proper medical or health officer, pending the transfer to a medical institution.



	2)	Verification of the actual work accomplishment of various infrastructure projects implemented by R.O. Nos. V, VI, XII, BARMM and NCR disclosed that 23 on-going infrastructure projects with total contract cost of P2,250,661,562.59 were not completed within the stipulated construction period:

	6)	However, no single construction project has been completed as at December 31, 2020 and contract extensions were granted due to (i) suspension of works due to COVID-19 pandemic; and (ii) suspension of works by the PNP-NCRPO in the case of Metro Manila District Jail projects:

	7)	The issuance of Presidential Proclamation No. 929 dated March 16, 2020, declaring a State of Calamity throughout the Philippines due to Covid-19 pandemic greatly affected completion of infrastructure projects wherein strict quarantine protocols were implemented to prevent the spread of the disease. To emphasize, the BJMP-NCR Task Force Covid-19 issued Task Force Covid-19 Resolution No. 1 dated April 3, 2020 and Unnumbered Resolution dated June 3, 2020 pertaining to the establishment of a COVID-19 Isolation Center in Payatas, Quezon City and a quarantine facility for newly-committed PDLs in Camp Bagong Diwa, Bicutan, Taguig City (QC Jail Annex). 



	8)	In the case of the two Metro Manila District Jail infrastructure projects that are situated in Camp Bagong Diwa, Bicutan, Taguig City, 62 days were added to the delay of the projects due to the suspension of works by PNP-NCRPO. BJMP was required by PNP-NCRPO to submit documentary requirements such as the authority to construct and other permits.



	9)	Despite lifting of the strict quarantine protocols and the resumption of works as well as the continued strict monitoring of the implementation of the project by BJMP NCR Management, the contractor averred that it had difficulties in completing the projects due to required compliance to Covid-19 Safety Guidelines imposed by the government such as limited work force to maintain social distancing and work/travel time restrictions.



	10)	Actual work accomplishments for CY 2020 ranges from 5.07 percent to 43.11 percent.  The increased rate of accomplishment for some projects may be attributed to the efforts of BJMP NCR Management in the strict monitoring of the implementation of the projects towards their completion.

	11)	Despite granting of contract time extensions and work suspensions the contractor incurred negative slippages on all on-going projects, even before the Covid-19 pandemic.  These negative slippages may be attributed to the contractor’s failure to provide necessary resources to implement and complete all six projects awarded to him on schedule, all at the same time:

	14)	R.O. V Management averred that the lockdown imposed by National Government due to Covid-19 pandemic and the safety and health protocols implemented in jails contributed to delayed completion of the project. 



	15)	R.O. V Management added that the construction of the two Type A Buildings in Tigaon District Jail were suspended because it was used by residents of the municipality as a quarantine facility for almost five months during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.



	16)	It can be gleaned from the Table of Contract Schedule for R.O. V that, except for the Construction of Three-Storey Jail Building with Roof-deck at Aroroy District Jail, the original and/or revised completion date of the four projects should have been completed before the imposition of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown on March 16, 2020.

	18)	R.O. V Management commented that the project “Construction of Jail Building Annex Phase 2 at Naga City District Jail” has been terminated on September 8, 2020 per Termination Contract Order dated September 7, 2020 and they are in the process of negotiating with the fourth lowest bidder for the completion of the unperformed portion of the project. 



	19)	R.O. V Management added that the projects “Construction of Jail Building Annex at Pioduran Municipal Jail and the Construction of Jail Building Annex at Masbate City Jail” were also terminated on September 23, 2020 and September 7, 2020, respectively and the construction of the unperformed portions have been awarded to a contractor.  



	20)	Inquiry revealed however that all infrastructure projects except Masbate City Jail Annex (single calculated and responsive bid), the negotiations have failed with the next lowest eligible bidders and eventually with all the bidders who joined the opening and evaluation of bids in CY 2018 due to differences in the bid unit price compared to the current market price, thereby prompting the R.O. V Management to look for contractors. 



	21)	In R.O. VI, construction of seven jail buildings with total contract cost of P101,400,828.64 remained uncompleted despite the granting of contract time extensions with delays ranging from 60 to 302 days.  Details are as follows:

	22)	In R.O. VI, approved contract time extensions granted to contractors range from 60 days to 445 days.  Despite the considerable amount of contract time extensions granted, the contractors still failed to complete the projects within the revised completion date.  



	23)	R.O. VI, Logistics Division explained that the delayed completion of projects was attributed to the following:

		

--			Work suspension due to series of lockdowns brought about by Covid-19 pandemic;

--			Difficulty in the delivery of construction materials due to mandatory closures of warehouses and lockdown of borders and ports caused by Covid-19 pandemic; and

--			Re-design of plans and bad weather conditions.



	24)	In R.O. XII, seven infrastructure projects amounting to P30,388,426.89 were given contract time extension but remained unfinished as of December 31, 2020.  Details are as follows:

	25)	Causes of delay in the completion of jail buildings and perimeter fences are the following:



--	The implementation of lockdown due to pandemic starting March 16, 2020;

--	Unworkability in the area due to adverse weather conditions;

--	Lack of construction materials delivered/stocked at project site;

--	Lack of manpower that should be provided by the contractor at jobsite;

--	Not implemented as planned and/or late start of the project; and

--	Lack of monitoring and supervision by the contractor.

	30)	In R.O. IV-A, there are three unoccupied facilities constructed in CY 2018 due to pending installation of electricity and perimeter fence:





Project Description/Jail Facility



Status



1

Gumaca District Jail

Installation of water supply system was completed in November 2020.  Awaiting installation of electricity line by QUEZELCO.

2

Batangas City Jail

Construction of perimeter fence for funding by City Government of Batangas

3

Lipa City Jail

Perimeter fence constructed in August 2020.  Awaiting installation of electricity line by BATELEC



	31)	R.O. III Management explained that the location of the five out of 11 newly completed jail buildings were far from the existing jail facilities; thus, there is a need to provide perimeter fence before these jail buildings become operational for security purposes. However, the construction of perimeter fence was not considered in the preparation of the Approved Budget for the Contract due to non-allocation of funds for the purpose.



	32)	In addition, the 11 jail buildings in R.O. III have no electricity and water that are essential in the operation of jail facilities. The electric/power supply of six jail buildings (used as quarantine facilities) were temporarily connected to the existing building because there are no funds allocated for utilities (water and electricity) connection.   



	33)	R.O. III Management commented that they will request funds from the NHQ for the purpose. Representations with LGUs have been made to facilitate their application for utilities (water and electricity) connection. 



	34)	Annex I of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 otherwise known as “Government Procurement Law” provides the guidelines on termination of contracts as follows:



Grounds for termination of Contracts



A)	Termination for Default



1)	In contracts for Goods:



Xxx



2)	In contracts for Infrastructure Projects:



The Procuring Entity shall terminate a contract for default when any of the following conditions attend its implementation: 



a)	Due to the Contractor’s fault and while the project is on-going, it has incurred negative slippage of fifteen percent (15%) or more in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 1870; 



b)	Due to the Contractor’s fault and after the contract time has expired, it has incurred a negative slippage of ten percent (10%) or more in the completion of the work; or 



c)	The Contractor: 



i)	abandons the contract works, refuses or fails to comply with a valid instruction of the Procuring Entity or fails to proceed expeditiously and without delay despite a written notice by the Procuring Entity; 



ii)	does not actually have on the project site the minimum essential equipment listed on the Bid necessary to prosecute the Works in accordance with the approved work plan and equipment deployment schedule as required for the project; 



iii)	 does not execute the Works in accordance with the contract or persistently or flagrantly neglects to carry out its obligations under the contract; 



iv)	neglects or refuses to remove materials or to perform a new work that has been rejected as defective or unsuitable; or 



v)	sub-lets any part of the contract works without approval by the Procuring Entity.



	35)	Further, GPPB Resolution No. 05-2019 dated March 8, 2019 provides guidance on contract termination due to fifteen percent negative slippage by the contractor and discussed that:

To ensure the timely implementation of infrastructure projects and effective management of the performance of contractors the following calibrated actions in response to delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects are hereby adopted:

xxx.

1.3. Negative slippage of fifteen percent (15%) – The implementing unit shall initiate termination of the contract or take-over of the work by administration or contract in accordance with Section 53.3 of the 2016 revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and the Revised Guidelines for the Implementation of Infrastructure Projects by Administration. It shall likewise take proper transitory measures to minimize work disruptions, e.g., take-over by administration while negotiation or rebidding is on-going.

	36)	Annex A – Detailed Engineering for the Procurement of Infrastructure of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides, among others, the following:



	No program of work for any project shall be approved without detailed engineering.  The program of work shall include among other things, estimates of work, items, quantities and costs and a PERT/CPM network of the project activities.  The program of work shall cover at least a usable portion of the project and no construction shall be started for portions of the project that are less than usable, except projects requiring stage construction, in which case continuity of construction up to the completion of a usable portion must be assured

	Xxx…

	

For projects to be implemented by phases, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that there is a clear delineation of work for each phase, which must be usable, and structurally sound.  It shall also ensure the conduct of the detailed engineering activities for each phase as provided for in Item 2 of this Guidelines.



	37)	It can be said that delays in the implementation and completion of jail facilities is not mainly due to restrictions and/or limitations brought about by Covid-19 pandemic but rather due to deficiencies in different stages of the infrastructure project implementation.



	38)	Planning and procurement activities play a vital role in the completion of infrastructure project.  The lack of provision for perimeter fence and utilities connection led to non-utilization of completed projects which could have been prevented if proper planning was conducted by R.O. III Regional Engineers and Technical Working Group (TWG).



	39)	Inadequate planning of these projects resulted in non-utilization of jail facilities as intended and defeated the objective of the Bureau in providing functional and responsive jail facility that promotes PDL.



	40)	On the other hand, inefficiencies in the conduct of post-qualification of prospective contractors were imminent as there are contracts that were terminated due to incapacity of the winning contractors to complete the projects.



	41)	If only BJMP’s Regional Engineers and TWG meticulously planned the project details and evaluated the capacity of contractors, delays in the implementation, completion and utilization of these projects may have been minimized if not prevented.



	42)	Likewise, had the Regional Engineers and Regional Logistics Division strictly supervised and monitored implementation of all infrastructure projects, deficiencies would have been detected earlier and appropriate measures may have been introduced early on.



	43)	Moreover, in R.O. Nos. V. IX, XI and BARRM, the delayed completion of infrastructure projects was not subjected to imposition of LDs or the imposed LDs were incorrectly computed contrary to Section 8 of Annex E of the Revised 2016 IRR of R.A 9184.



	44)	Section 8, Annex “E” of the Revised 2016 IRR of RA 9184 provides that where a contractor fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extensions duly granted and is in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay LDs an amount provided in the conditions of the contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one percent of the cost of unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.



	45)	In R.O. V, the computed LDs for the Design and Build of Two Storey Jail Building with Roof deck at San Andres City Jail amounting to P71,884.04 was only based on a 60-day delay in the completion of the project.  However, the recomputed delays per latest Statement of Work Accomplishment (SWA) submitted should be 166 days with LDs amounting to P198,879.18 or a difference of P126,995.14. 



	46)	On the other hand, for three delayed projects, no LDs were imposed and deducted against the claims of contractor for progress billings pertaining to the incurred delays ranging from 76 to 115 days based on the submitted SWA.  Details are as follows:

	50)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



a)	Regional Engineers  and TWG to meticulously plan the details of the projects in an efficient and effective manner to ensure proper impementation, timely completion and immediate utilization of all infrasturcture projects;



b)	Regional BAC and TWG to strictly and properly check technical and financial capability of contractors prior to award to ensure their full compliance to stipulations in the contract;



c)	Regional Engineers and Regional Logistics Division to properly supervise and monitor implementation/construction of all on-going infrastructure projects and enforce contract stipulations in the completion of the project within the agreed period and/or time specified in the contract;



d)	Regional Directors to ensure that contract extension shall be granted only on conditions provided under Annex E of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184;



e)	R.Os concerned to evaluate all on-going infrastructure projects and consider termination of contract pursuant to (i) GPPB Resolution No. 05-2019 dated March 8, 2019 and the 2016 Revised IRR and (ii) the provisions in the general and special conditions of the contract, without prejudice to the suspension; blacklisting, and/or filing of appropriate charges against the erring contractors; 



f)	R.O. Nos. III and IV-A expedite installation of electricity and perimeter fences pertaining to 14 newly-completed jail facilities necessary for their immediate utilization; and



g)	Regional Accountants to:  



i)	assess and/or initiate computation of liquidated damages or forfeit performance security, if warranted, on contracts with delayed implementation; and 



ii)	demand from contractors the unpaid LDs and/or deduct from their claims the correctly computed LDs.

	51)	Management commented the following:



a)	BJMP Management in its desire to improve and/or refine existing processes and procedures relating to construction implementation, supervision and monitoring in order that delays are mitigated and/or prevented towards the efficient and timely completion of all infrastructure projects, the Chief BJMP issued unnumbered Memorandum dated July 23, 2020, enjoining compliance to exiting rules and regulations relative to the following:



i)	conduct of detailed engineering study and the inclusion of the administrative costs in the  computation of the total project costs (BJMP-DL-MC-89 dated January 7, 2020); and



ii)	project monitoring - BJMPDPRM-Letter Orders Number 2020-572 dated July 17, 2020.



With strict project monitoring conducted by the National Project Monitoring Team created under BJMPDPRM-Letter Orders Number 2020-572 dated July 17, 2020, various infrastructure projects were completed and the numbers of delayed on-going projects were reduced from 49 as of December 31, 2019 to 23 as of December 31, 2020, despite the imposition of community quarantine and strict health protocols nationwide.



b)	BJMP NCR Management commented that since this has been the first time for the BJMP-NCR and even the whole Bureau to handle such an immense budget for Capital Outlay without much experience on the specifics and technicalities on these undertakings coupled with the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bureau continues to take appropriate measures to improve/refine its existing processes and procedures towards the timely completion of the projects.



With strict supervision and monitoring, BJMP-NCR’s infrastructure projects have reported work accomplishments as much as 43.11 per cent for CY 2020 alone despite the imposed community quarantine and strict health protocols being implemented in the NCR. 



c)	R.O. V Management commented that corresponding LDs were imposed and that they continue to coordinate with contractors for the successful negotiations for the completion of the infrastructure projects. 



d)	R.O. VI Regional Engineers and Logistics Jail Non-Officer Rank were tasked to closely monitor the implementation of infrastructure projects regionwide. All contractors were also informed that all delayed projects should be completed by June 2021 and request for the issuance of NTCA from BJMP-NHQ shall be only acted upon until June 30,2021.



e)	R.O. IX Management will implement the imposition of liquidated damages on every progress billing on projects that incurs a negative slippage of 10 percent or more as of billing date and agreed to carefully evaluate requests for work suspensions/time extensions and their corresponding supporting documents before issuing any order.



f)	R.O. XII Management is deploying and reassigning additional technical personnel to oversee the projects and requiring them to extensively supervise the implementation of the projects and to regularly render reports on its status.  



The Regional Project Monitoring Team (RPMT) was created and tasked to inspect and regularly monitor the projects. The RPMT will also be in charge of informing and reminding the contractors of their findings relative to the proper implementation of the projects in conformity with the contract.  Further, the NHQ already directed the R.O. to come up with a better strategy to expedite the completion of the projects. Moreover, and as advised by NHQ, all unfinished projects must be completed before June 30, 2021.



Management has already called the attention of all contractors with delayed projects and informed them of their imposable LDs prior to the release of their final billing. Further, the R.O. has also initiated the termination procedures to projects with 10 percent incurred LDs and 15 percent negative slippage.



g)	BARMM Management explained that the delay in the construction of jail building at DOS Maguindanao was brought about by (1) failure to start immediately upon receipt of NTP due to adverse claimants that came up and settled; (2) re-survey of the donated lot due to change of the actual lot donated; (3) additional earth fill brought by the change of the actual location made by the done; and (4) suspension of work caused by the Enhanced Community Quarantine. Despite several contract time extensions, the contractor still failed to complete the project on time. The Management was precluded from rescinding the contract since it will only cause additional cost to the government and additional delay in the completion of the project. As a result of the delay, the Management decided to impose penalties to the contractor on top of the Suspension Order made by the BAC and as approved by the Head of the Agency to bar for two years the contractor from participating in any future project to be procured by the Region.



Management added that they have granted contract time extensions relative to the completion of the two projects recently completed at WAO Municipal Jail and Malabang District Jail and have imposed LDs for the delays incurred after the granted contract time extensions.





Congestion of Jails



7)	The total jail population of 115,336 as of December 31, 2020 exceeded the total ideal capacity of 34,893 with a variance of 80,443 or a total average occupancy rate of 403 percent, precluding the Agency in attaining its objectives of: (a) improving the living conditions of inmates and (b) enhancing the safekeeping and development of inmates in preparation for their eventual reintegration into the mainstream of the society upon their release due to unhealthy environment affecting the morale and health conditions of Persons Deprived of Liberty contrary to Rule 10 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners



1)	

2)	

	1)	The BJMP aims to enhance public safety by providing humane safekeeping and development of inmates in all district, city and municipal jails.  To attain this mission, the following objectives should be achieved:



--	Improved living conditions of inmates in accordance with accepted standards set by the United Nations;

--	Enhanced safekeeping and development of inmates in preparation for their eventual reintegration into the mainstream of the society upon their release; and

--	Professionalized jail services.----footnote1----

	2)	Rule 10 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners states that: All accommodation provided for the use of prisoners and in particular all sleeping accommodation shall meet all requirements of health, due regard being paid to climatic conditions and particularly to cubic content of air, minimum floor space, lighting, heating and ventilation.



	3)	Paragraph 4 Chapter I of BJMP Manual on Habitat, Water, Sanitation and Kitchen in Jails provides:



--	   Cell Capacity: 



Ideal Habitable floor area per inmate - 4.7 square meters

Maximum number of inmates per cell - 10

Maximum number of bunks beds - 5 units two level

Wash area (for utensils, hand washing) - 1 unit

Water closet (toilet bowl) - 1 unit

Bath area – unit

	4)	The capacity of a prison is the total number of detainees that it can accommodate. The occupancy rate also known as the population density in the prison is determined using the following formula:



	                                                    Number of detainees present at date “t”

	              Occupancy rate =                                                                                     x 100

	                                           Number of detainees specified by the official capacity   



	5)	When the ratio obtained exceeds 100 (100 detainees per 100 places), the situation is one of overpopulation or “over occupancy.” Conversely, if the figure is lower than 100, the prison is “under occupied.”



	6)	Congestion in jails resulted in health and sanitation problems as well as increased gang affiliation of inmates. To sustain survival, inmates hold on to gangs or “pangkat” where they find protection, network of social support and most important, access to material benefits, which are scarce in highly congested facilities.



	7)	The BJMP jails comprise of District Jails (DJ), City Jails (CJ), Municipal Jails (MJ), Extension Jails (CJ-Annex), and Female Dormitories (FD). Each jail has different lot area, floor area and cell area. As of December 31, 2020, the BJMP has a total jail population of 115,336 which exceeded the total ideal capacity of 34,893 having a variance of 80,443 or has a total average of 403 percent of congestion/overcrowding or clogging.

	8)	R.O. IV-A topped the most overcrowded jails followed by R.O. III, and NCR. The jails in CAR are the least congested jail for the whole year. 



	9)	While the Agency has been continously professionalizing the jail services as well as unceasingly provides for the basic needs of PDL such as food, drugs and medicines, rehabilitation supplies, etc., congestion has always been one of the biggest challenges in carrying out its mandate in humane safekeeping and development of PDL under its care.  



	10)	We noted that total jail population decreased by 15,331 PDL from CY 2019 to CY 2020, congestion rates likewise decreased by 35 percent from 438 percent in CY 2019 to 403 percent in CY 2020 in view of the suspension of commitment due to the current pandemic, speedy disposition of drug cases in relation with the adoption of Plea-Bargaining Framework in Drug Cases, application of R.A. No. 10592 and continuous paralegal interventions.



	11)	While congestion rate decreases by 35 percent in CY 2020, 403 percent congestion rate is still way beyond the accepted standards set by the United Nations that may have precluded the Agency in attaining its objectives in: (a) improving the living conditions of inmates; and (b) enhancing the safekeeping and development of inmates in preparation for their eventual reintegration into the mainstream of the society upon their release due to unhealthy environment affecting the health, morale and disposition of PDL.



	12)	In BJMP NCR, jail population likewise decreases by 8,436 from 35,574 in CY 2019 to 27,138 in CY 2020 in view of the Bureau’s swift action to decongest the jails in support to the government’s decongestion program in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.



	13)	Various Supreme Court Guidelines were issued to decongest jails such as the following:



--	Administrative Circular (AC) No. 33-2020 supplemented by Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Circular No. 89-2020, which allowed the electronic filing of information and transmission of release orders;



--	OCA Circular No. 91-2020 which reiterated the guidelines on the release of qualified PDLs through self-recognizance and provisional dismissal;



--	AC No. 37-2020 which allowed pilot testing of video-conference hearings of urgent matters in criminal cases involving PDLs; and



--	OCA Circular Nos. 121-2020 and 149-2020 to suspend the issuance of commitment orders for newly arrested PDL to the BJMP committing new PDL for August to September 2020.



	14)	The swift action by BJMP NCR in the implementation of the aforementioned Supreme Court Guidelines in the release of PDL and its efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through the establishment of isolation and quarantine facilities have significantly decrease the jail population in the National Capital Region.



	15)	While jail population decreases, congestion rate remains high in the Region and BJMP NCR admitted that jail congestion leads to the following:



--	Health and sanitation problems resulting to wide spread of diseases, especially during these times due to the COVID-19 pandemic;



--	Increased gang affiliation in order to sustain survival and gain access to material benefits which are scarce in highly congested facilities; and



--	Demoralized and/or mentally-ill condition due to an unhealthy environment.



	16)	These conditions greatly affect the morale and disposition of PDLs considering that they are not yet convicted and are presumed innocent.



	17)	To further address the pressing issues on congestion of jail facilities, the BJMP has received appropriation in the amount P1,775,588,000 and P2,890,159,371.55 for CY 2018 and CY 2019, respectively intended for the construction of jail facilities for implementation and completion in CY 2020.  However, 29 on-going projects in the total amount of P2,302,773,885.04 that are implemented by the BJMP have been delayed as discussed in Item No. 5 of this report.



	18)	In addition to the infrastructure projects being implemented by BJMP to address congestion, funds were transferred to LGUs amounting to P325,225,000.00.  Details are as follows:

	20)	The MOA with LGUs provides for the following Roles and Responsibilities of both parties, among others:



	a)	BJMP Regional Offices shall:



--	Monitor prompt liquidation of funds transferred and see that the required documents are submitted within the period of thirty (30) days after the completion of the projects.

--	Review and approve the Scope of Work and ensure that the cost estimates is commensurate to the Fund Transferred.

--	Conduct periodic monitoring, inspection and evaluation of the progress of the Scope of Work, utilization of funds, and compliance with the MOA and project documents.



	b)	LGUs shall:



--	Ensure the completion of the project, in accordance with the approved Scope of Work.

--	Submit pre, during and post project implementation, digital photos/videos of site work and accomplishment and ensure that the requirements are implemented according to the plan, programs and priorities of BJMP Regional Office.

--	Within thirty (30) days after project implementation, submit the Fund Utilization Report certified by its accountant and approved by both parties.

--	Turn-over the Scope of work to BJMP Regional Office with corresponding Certificate of Completion, Certificate of Acceptance and copies of the Warranty Security issued by the Contractor.











	21)	We recommended that Management:



a)	include in its budget appropriation a provision for capital outlay for the purchase of lots and/or construction of additional jail facilities to address the continued and increasing jail population; 



b)	continue its effort making representations with different LGUs and other NGAs for possible lot donations and/or construction/expansion of jail facilities giving priority to those extremely crowded jail facilities;



c)	instruct the Regional Directors to:



i)	impose the provisions/stipulations in the general and special conditions of the contract specifically on the construction schedule and project completion; and



ii)	enforce provisions/stipulations in the MOA subject of the transferred funds to LGUs specifically on the approved scope of works and construction schedule.



d)	enhance and intensify the GCTA process and give more emphasis on the Recognizance Act for detainees' early release without necessarily completing their sentence which could significantly reduce jail population and congestion.



	22)	Management commented the following:



	a)	BJMP Management commented that the current congestion rate does not imply that all BJMP jail facilities are operating in sub-normal conditions as there are jails which meet the minimum occupancy rates and able to provide PDL with health and sanitary surroundings.



	b)	The BJMP-NCR’s persistently reiterating and monitoring the implementation of various Supreme Court Guidelines to decongest jail facilities. At present, they are currently upgrading their technical capability to facilitate the requirements in the “new normal”, that is, videoconference hearings for PDL. Based on their assessment, the region is capable and is willing to facilitate a pilot test for the procurement of Information and Technology (IT) equipment. Procurement in the regional level will reduce the burden of the BJMP top management and will ensure better control, supervision and fast implementation. Improved technical capability will facilitate the requirements related to PDL hearings and will ensure no delay on urgent matters involving PDL criminal cases. 



	c)	On-going infrastructure projects, continuous coordination and collaboration with all offices concerned is being conducted in employing strict measures towards its completion in order to ease jail congestion. Frequent on-site inspections and evaluation to assess progress of all on-going constructions are being done by their engineers.



	d)	Moreover, as a result of the recently conducted Regional Development Council Budget Consultation for FY 2022 on February 19, 2021 thru videoconferencing, the board of panelists will be endorsing the proposed construction of New Marikina City Jail and the New Muntinlupa City Jail. Similar recommendation was likewise given as to the lobbying of the proposed jail expansion and improvements to their counterpart LGUs.



	e)	R.O. IV-A Management commented that the newly constructed jail facilities namely; GMA Municipal Jail, Nasugbu Municipal Jail and Carmona Municipal Jail have been occupied to decongest the jail facilities in the region. Management continuously making all efforts and coordination with different LGUs for lot donation pursuant to “OPLAN Decongestion”.



	f)	R.O. X Management commented that the congestion rate in the Region as at year-end decreased to 121 percent from 237 percent and that four jail buildings and one rehabilitation center have been completed in April 2021 that will significantly reduce the congestion rate in the region.  





Gender and Development (GAD)



8)	The BJMP NHQ and its nine R.Os allocated funds and implemented programs and projects related to Gender and Development.   However, in R.O. Nos. IV-B, V, IX, X, XI and BARMM there was insufficient fund allocation, deficient and/or unsubmitted/delayed submission of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report (AR), contrary to Section 31 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465 or GAA of FY 2020.



1)	

2)	

	1)	Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that all Agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets.



	2)	The preparation and submission of annual GAD Plans and annual GAD ARs shall be guided by Joint Circular (JC) No. 2004-01 dated April 5, 2004 issued by the DBM, NEDA and PCW or Philippine Commission on Women (formerly the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women) as well as other guidelines on GPB that may be issued by the appropriate oversight agencies.



	3)	R.O. V had appropriated a total of P6,086,080.00 for GAD programs and activities. The amount however, represents only four (4) percent of its annual budget of P152,152,152.00 or below the minimum requirement, which is five percent of the budget. Had the agency budgeted and utilized at least five (5) percent of its appropriations per CY 2020 GAA equivalent to at least P7,607,607.60, more GAD activities could have been implemented and the desired outcome for the GAD budget to influence the entire agency program, plan and budget may have been attained.



	4)	The gender responsiveness of reported programs and activities in the GAD AR of R.O. IV-B for CY 2020 could not be ascertained due to absence of PCW-endorsed or Central Office (CO) reviewed GPB. 



	5)	In R.O. Nos. IX and XI, evaluation of the agency’s GPB and GAD AR for CY 2020 disclosed that the reports were not prepared in accordance with the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. Details as follows:
