OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger (SL) 

  

1. Non-maintenance of SLs to supplement the details of the controlling accounts 
appearing in the general ledgers (GL) prevented the timely reconciliation of 

relevant records, which is not in accord with Section 49, Chapter 19, Volume I 

of the GAM.  

 

Section 49, Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM requires that the Trial Balance shall be 

supported with the schedule of SL balances of the controlling accounts.  

 

We observed that the SLs intended to support the accounting balances of the assets 

of the agency (Supplies Ledger Cards, PPE Ledger Cards) have not been updated 

for years despite the previous audit recommendations to update the same. Thus, the 

Team reviewed all existing SLs to confirm the compliance by the Accounting 

Section, and noted the following:

According to the Accountant III, the SLs were not prepared due to lack of 

manpower who will also monitor the movement of the related accounts. Whenever 

he encounters any un-reconciled balance, he reviews the related journal entry to 

trace the discrepancy. 

 

We emphasize that the said process is only helpful in detecting recent accounting 

errors, while the maintenance of SL minimizes errors and increases efficiency in the 

reconciliation of records, which is necessary in keeping accurate records. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant III to 

maintain SL for each controlling account. 
 

 

Outputs/deliverables and payment schedules were not indicated in the TOR 

  

2. The timeline for the submission of outputs/deliverables and the payment 
schedules were not indicated in the TOR for consultants; hence, the monthly 

payments to the consultants may not correspond to the outputs delivered.  



28 

 

The agency hired consultants to fill the gap on the lack of expertise in the field of 

Archeology, Electronic Records Management, Infrastructure Projects, Spanish 

Language, and others. The TOR for consulting services sets the background/ 

objectives/duration of the project, professional requirements, required outputs/ 

deliverables, milestones that will trigger contract payments, and others.  

 

Our review of the Term of Reference for the consultants showed that the timeline 

for the submission of outputs/deliverables, and the payment schedules were not 

indicated therein, instead the payments to the consultants were made equally per 

month.

The contract was

outputs. 

 

Since the hiring of consultants is to address the gap on the lack of experts and that 

their services are cost-prohibitive, their services in the agency should result in 

clearly defined outputs at a certain period of time. Thus, it is of importance that the 

timeline for the submission of outputs/deliverables and the payment schedules 

should be indicated in the TOR. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the members of the 

Bids and Awards Committee to indicate in the TOR the timeline for the 

submission of outputs/deliverables and the payment schedules in hiring 

consultants. 



29 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management commented that there was no timeline for the submission of 

outputs/deliverables for said consultants. The underlying factors such as 

management’s activities, schedules meetings with other stakeholders and other 

government agencies and to some degree, specific instructions were considered in 

the delivery of outputs/deliverables. Some outputs/deliverables were dependent 

upon these factors and were vital in performing their works. In addition, the 

pandemic, which started in early 2020 disrupted the NAP’s schedules and targets. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team maintained the need to specify in the TOR the required 

outputs/deliverables, and the timeline of submission that will trigger the payment to 

the consultants. Said underlying factors should have been considered during the 

preparation of the TOR so that required outputs are clearly defined and time-

bounded. 

 

 

Incomplete supporting documents 

  

3. The payments to consultants, appraiser and security provider totaling 
₱3,246,362.31 were not adequately supported with necessary documents such 

as accomplishment and appraiser reports, approved final report and daily 

time records, in violation of Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445; hence, propriety of 

transactions was not completely ascertained. 

 

Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 requires that claims against government funds shall 

be supported with complete documentation.

The noted deficiency indicated lapses in the Accounting Section during the 

lockdown as they failed to check the completeness of the supporting documents and 

propriety of transactions before payment. The Accomplishment Reports are 

necessary in verifying whether the outputs/services required from them have 

actually been done or achieved in a particular period. The absence of the required 

documents casts doubts on the validity and propriety of the expenses. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned payees 

and agency personnel to submit the lacking documents to the Audit Team. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management explained that limited transportation and logistics caused by the 

community quarantine contributed to the deficiency, however, it will submit the 

required documents. 

 

 

Payment of salaries of contractual personnel through cash advances (CAs) 

  

4. Payment of salaries for contractual personnel totaling ₱2,943,483.43 was made 
through CAs, inconsistent with DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16. 

 

DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-016 dated December 23, 2013 requires that, starting 

January 1, 2014, Accounts Payable due to creditors/payees of all national 

government agencies, which included employees of the department/agency, shall be 

settled thru Expanded Modified Disbursement System, a payment procedure 

whereby Government Servicing Banks shall pay the creditor/payees listed in the 

List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable with Advice to Debit Account 

(ADA) through direct credit to the payee’s current/savings/Automated Teller 



31 

Machine (ATM) account. Said requirement was reiterated in the updated guidelines 

under DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018. 

 

The Audit Team noted that CAs were granted to Special Disbursing Officers 

(SDOs) for the payment of the salaries of contractual personnel, as follows:

Cash payment runs counter with the DBM issuances and does not promote sound 

internal control system in cash management. The payment through CA has 

drawbacks, such as increased cash accountability on the part of the disbursing 

officer, risk of loss or misuse of funds, inconvenience on the part of the payees as 

they still need to personally get their salaries from the disbursing officer, and loss 

of man-hours due to physical distribution of cash. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, Finance and 

Administrative Division (FAD) to strictly comply with the DBM Circular in 

the payment of salaries. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management commented that normally it pays the contractual personnel 

through the NAP payroll account, from which the respective salaries are directly 



32 

credited to their bank accounts. It prompted to pay their salaries through CA mainly 

due to the community quarantines, which disrupted transportation and logistics. 

The accomplishment reports and daily time records could not be delivered on-time 

and newly hired personnel had no bank accounts and could hardly enroll/open bank 

accounts because of the pandemic. In this manner, they were able to get their pay in 

due time amid the difficulties and in times of adversity. 

 

 

Overpayment in security services 

  

5. The agency paid the security provider twice for the same man-hours rendered 
by the same security guards, resulting in overpayment of ₱6,672.22. 

 

The recorded transactions in the account Security Services amounted to 

₱9,698,179.67 representing billings by Arm Corporate Security Services, Inc. to the 

agency for the security services that were rendered in CY 2020. 

 

The payment arrangement is bi-monthly basis and more or less consistently applied 

during the year. There was a distinct payment in July 2020 in the amount of 

₱95,876.92 for the services rendered from November 8-30, 2019 and January 1 to 

March 15, 2020 to escort the transfer of Spanish documents. We noted an 

overpayment of ₱6,672.22 since this payment included billings by the security 

provider for the same man-hours rendered by the same security guards, as follows:

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant III to 

deduct from the subsequent billing of the security provider the overpayment of 

₱6,672.22. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management already informed the security service provider of this error and 

requested them to deduct the overpayment from the incoming billing. 

 

 

Lack of accountability 

  

6. Recurring audit observations that remained unresolved for years such as (a) 
non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), (b) cash balances 



33 

were not reverted to the General Fund (GF), and non-reconciliation of 

property records manifest lack of accountability among the concerned officers 

and employees. 

 

The Philippine Constitution emphasizes the importance of accountability in the 

government. Section 1 of Article XI reminds every Filipino that: 

  

“Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must, 

at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost 

responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency . . .” 

  

As part of its responsibility to monitor and ensure accountability in government 

operations, COA prepares the AAR and is issued to report on the results of audit on 

the operations and transactions of an agency during the year. 

 

We reviewed the AARs of NAP from CYs 2017 to 2019 and noted that the 

following audit observations were recurring, and that the concerned agency officers 

and employees continuously failed to implement the audit recommendations: 

 

a) non-submission of BRS 
 

Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM requires that the Chief Accountant 

shall submit to the Audit Team the BRS within 20 days after receipt of the monthly 

Bank Statement. 

 

In CY 2018, the Accountant III incurred delays in the submission of the BRS, while 

in CY 2019 it failed to recognize the valid reconciling items in the books of 

accounts immediately after the preparation of the BRS. While for CY 2020, the 

Accountant III did not submit any BRS during the year; thus, the cash in bank 

balance totaling ₱142,217.12 as of December 31, 2020 could not be verified. 

 

b) cash balances were not reverted 
 

Since CY 2017, the Audit Team has recommended to the NAP Management to 

revert to the General Fund (GF) the following balances as required in Section 98 of 

PD No. 1445 and Section 6 of DBM Circular No. 2004-5A: 

 
Year Description Amount (₱) AAR Reference 

Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust Account

2019 65,000.00 CY 2019 

2020 81,000.00 - 

          Total 272,480.00  



34 

 

The Accountant III commented that the above amounts are still for reconciliation. 

We disagreed at is remained unreconciled until today and that this observation has 

been recurring each year. 

 

c) non-reconciliation of property records 
 

Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually for Inventories and 

annually for PPE is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of 

property custodianship. 

 

For each category of asset, the Accounting Section shall maintain ledger cards 

(Supplies Ledger Cards, PPE Ledger Cards), while the Property and Supply Section 

shall maintain property records (Stock Cards, Property Cards). The balances per 

ledger card and property record shall be reconciled on a regular basis. They shall 

also be reconciled with other property records, such as the report on physical count, 

property acknowledgement receipts and others. 

 

We noted that since CY 2017, both the Accounting Section and Property and 

Supply Section were not able to reconcile their records as they continuously failed 

to update the ledger cards and the property records. 

 

On one hand, the Inventory Committee did not complete the physical count of 

inventories that would report the physical count and condition of Inventories and 

PPE in CY 2020. We were informed that the different Heads of the NAP Divisions 

composed the Inventory Committee to aid in the conduct of the physical count. We 

noted that the last physical count for inventories was in CY 2019, where the 

reported balance differed by ₱187,830.12 against the book balance. In the case of 

PPE, the complete physical count was conducted for CY 2017 but there was a 

material difference of ₱21,533,216.66 when it was compared with the book balance. 
 

The non-completion of physical count and non-reconciliation of the property 

records cast doubt on the validity of the reported balances of the agency’s assets. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) Accountant III to: 
 

i. submit at once the BRS for CY 2020; and 
ii. prepare JEV to take up the reversion of unused funds to the General 

Fund; 

 

b) Accountant III and the Property and Supply Officer to update their 
records, to facilitate the reconciliation with the physical count; and 

 



35 

c) Inventory Committee to prioritize in CY 2021 the conduct of physical 
count of all the assets of the agency. 

 

Moreover, we recommended and the Executive Director agreed to investigate 

and as warranted, hold officers and employees accountable for continually 

failing to act on the reported observations. 

 
 

Annual target of 15 government offices with approved/updated RDS is too few 

  

7. The agency’s annual target of 15 government offices with approved/updated 
RDS is deemed too few considering that 409 agencies still have no RDS, 

resulting in the absence of guidelines for the retention and disposition of their 

substantive records. 

 

Section 16 of RA No. 9470 dated May 31, 2007 states that all government offices, 

including Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations shall prepare and 

submit RDS in the prescribed form, which upon approval by the Executive Director 

shall govern the disposition of all the records of that government office. 

 

In addition, Section 17 of the same Act provides that the NAP shall develop a 

general records disposition schedule (GRDS) that shall prescribe the disposal of 

public records common to all government offices. 

 

Our verification disclosed that based on the latest Matrix of Government Agencies 

with or without RDS on December 19, 2020, 552 agencies have already an 

approved RDS, while 409 agencies still have no RDS. 

 

Our inquiry disclosed that each Records Management Analyst has specific 

assignments for technical assistance on the establishment/revision of RDS. Since 

2018, the Records Management Services Division (RMSD) has a target of 15 

government offices with approved/updated RDS every year. Hence, with the current 

annual target, it will take about three decades to attain the requirement of the law 

that all government agencies must have its own RDS (409 agencies / 15 annual 

target = 27.30 years). Further, it takes about a year to establish and approve an RDS 

due to several coordination between the NAP and its client-agencies. 

 

We were informed that the smaller/attached agencies without RDS can utilize the 

GRDS and the approved RDS of the bigger/parent-Department, for the management 

and disposal of the common records. The RMSD, however, did not receive any 

request for disposal of valueless common records from any attached agencies. This 

facility could not be utilized in disposing the substantive records, or those records 

created internally because of different agency functions; hence, the need for the 

establishment of the agency RDS. 

 



36 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, RMSD to 

continue making representation with the heads of government agencies with no 

RDS and to set a considerable increment of yearly target of agencies. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management invited all the different departments for a consultative meeting 

held on February 17, 2021 where part of the agenda is to set-up/update RDS. 

Likewise, an RDS drive on a rotating regional basis for local government units will 

be launched in 2021. 

 

 

Records management audit every five years not conducted 

  

8. Absence of operational guidelines prevented the Inventory and Scheduling 
Section (ISS) to conduct the records management audit every five years, which 

is not in accord with Section 29 of RA No. 9470 of 2007, resulting in non-

determination of the adherence by government agencies to policies on records 

management. 

 

Section 29 of RA No. 9470 provides that the Executive Director shall conduct a 

periodic inspection of the records holdings of the NAP and of other government 

offices, whether national or local. In relation to this, the NAP Standard Operating 

Procedures Manual provides that the ISS of the RMSD shall conduct records 

management audit every five (5) years to determine whether government agencies 

are complying with the records keeping requirements of the government, and 

monitor the adherence of government agencies to policies, rules and regulations on 

records management. 

 

Our inquiry with the Chief, RMSD disclosed that the records management audit has 

not been conducted due to the sudden change of administration and its priorities. It 

was also mentioned that the said audit is a very broad process, which includes all 

the aspects of records and archives management of all government agencies in the 

entire country and should not be interpreted as a regular function of the ISS. 

 

Records management audit is a huge task, which will be very impossible for ISS to 

implement and to monitor apart from the regular functions of the RMSD. Presently, 

the RMSD conducts files audit but is limited only to the appraisal and 

recommendation of records for disposal of government agencies, identification and 

classification of records, which is included in NAP Form No. 1 (Inventory and 

Appraisal Form), being one of the requirements for the establishment/revision of 

agency RDS. They also assist government agencies to comply with the 

requirements stipulated in NAP General Circular No. 1, such as the establishment 

of File Classification Guide and policies related to filing, and the Creation of 

Records Management Improvement Committee, which will serve as the decision 



37 

making and advisory body for the records management programs of each 

government agency. 

 

The Audit Team recognizes the above-mentioned activities (e.g., files audit, 

identification/classification of records), but such actions are the regular functions of 

the RMSD. The records management audit is an oversight function by the NAP to 

determine the compliance with the prescribed records management and 

administration of their client-agencies and to recommend improvement 

opportunities, if necessary. The problem is that the ISS could not conduct the audit 

in the absence of operational guidelines, which should have been established from 

the promulgation of RA No. 9470. Said guidelines should set the objectives, scope, 

timeline, audit procedures, selection criteria, audit risk prioritization and others. 

 

We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to create an audit 

committee to formulate the operational guidelines for the records management 

audit that shall be conducted by the ISS. 
 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management commented that on top of the establishment of RDS of different 

agencies, they will come up with the audit guidelines within this year to 

operationalize the records management audit. 

 

 

Records not sorted out for disposition 

  

9. The lack of concrete transfer and disposal plan in the Records Center Division 
(RCD) resulted in accumulation of (a) permanent records that should have 

been transferred to the Archives Collection and Access Division (ACAD) for 

their preservation, (b) records from abolished/defunct agencies for re-

appraisal, and (c) records for safekeeping and/or with referrals which could 

not be disposed of. 

 

The RCD serves as the central repository of inactive/non-current public records of 

different government agencies, including abolished ones, that provides economical 

and efficient storage, timely retrieval, facility security, document processing, and 

proper documentation of potential archives materials. The Pre-Archivage Section of 

RCD is tasked to do the following: 

 

1) screening, segregating of non-current public records for retention, disposal, 
or transfer to the ACAD for permanent preservation; and 

 

2) determination and recommendation for disposal of records that passed the 
prescribed retention period for agency’s concurrence and approval of the 

Executive Director. 

 



38 

We noted in the records holdings of RCD as of November 30, 2020 that there are 

permanent records not yet transferred to ACAD, huge inventory of records from 

abolished agencies for re-appraisal, and accumulation of records for safekeeping 

and/or with referrals. 

 

a) permanent records not transferred to ACAD for preservation 
 

The GRDS and RDS identify permanent records for preservation and temporary 

records, which could be disposed after the retention period. As of November 30, 

2020, there are permanent records, which are overdue for transfer to ACAD. 

Inquiry from concerned personnel of ACAD revealed that said permanent records 

could not be accommodated due to lack of storage space. 

 

We emphasized that the main objective for the transfer is to preserve the permanent 

records; hence, further delay may increase the risk of possible loss, damage and/or 

deterioration of historically valuable records. Both the RCD and ACAD should 

have earlier planned for the transfer. 

 

b) huge inventory of records from abolished agencies 
 

There are 48 accession records from abolished/defunct agencies that occupy about 

73.70 cu. m. in the RCD storage area. We were informed that in most cases, the 

abolished/defunct agencies do not have RDS that sets the retention and disposition 

period of the records. However, the NAP’s RDS, which was approved on March 1, 

2019 already incorporated said records of abolished/defunct agencies. The 

authorized retention period is 15 years; thus, after the retention period, the RCD can 

recommend the disposal of said records after re-appraisal and have no referrals. 

 

We noted that there were also permanent records that are still to be transferred to 

ACAD. Likewise, since RCD is undermanned, further appraisal and re-appraisal 

could not be done for a lot of records. Some Archivists were detailed to other 

Divisions, newly hired Records Management Analysts and Archivists still need 

proper monitoring and guidance before they can appraise records, especially the 

201 files of personnel and accounting records. 

 

c) accumulation of records for safekeeping and/or with referrals 
 

There are 48 accession records from existing agencies that occupy about 78.12 cu. 

m. in the RCD storage area. We noted from the records holdings that they were 

labelled as for safekeeping and/or with referrals; hence, the RCD was restricted to 

recommend it to be disposed even after the retention period. Also, the owner-

agency did not issue its concurrence to dispose the records since they still need or 

refer to some of the document. 

 

The policy that owner-agency needs to concur to dispose its records stands. Hence, 

the RCD must come up with supplemental policy for the records for safekeeping 



39 

and/or with referrals (e.g., final retention period in the storage area and immediate 

removal of records from the storage area) to avoid accumulation of records. 

Presently, the storage area in RCD is limited, resulting in reduced number of 

accessions every year. 

 

The RCD serves government agencies with limited storage capacity. But with the 

existing conditions as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the RCD could not 

likewise provide enough storage for them. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) instruct the Chief, RCD to: 
 

i. immediately transfer the permanent records to ACAD; 
ii. prepare an action plan that includes the timeline and 

prioritization of appraisal activities of all records from 

abolished/defunct agencies; and 

iii. propose a supplemental policy on records for safekeeping and/or 
with referrals (e.g., final retention period in the storage area and 

immediate removal of records from the storage area), for the 

approval of the Executive Director; and 

 

b) require the Chief, ACAD to augment the existing storage area for 
permanent records from the RCD. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Chief, RCD commented that additional personnel is needed to carry out the 

appraisal of the records holdings. While the Chief, ACAD magnified the existing 

limitation in their storage area since it currently houses 121,490 bundles of notarial, 

civil, and other agency records and additional repository of 107,232 bundles. She 

suggested to acquire/rent an off-site storage facility to accommodate the records 

since the existing storage facilities are no longer capable of accepting additional 

records, and the newly-acquired property at the Otis Building is yet to be retrofitted. 

Further, both the Chiefs, RCD and ACAD will prepare the plan of action to 

expedite the transfer and/or disposal of the records from various government 

agencies. 

 

The Executive Director explained that by law, all notarial records must be 

transferred to NAP since they are considered permanent records. Hence, a plan to 

change the legislation on notarial records such as allowing disposal after a certain 

period. Also, they need to target more warehouses for RCD and ACAD. 

 

 

 

 



40 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team recognized the limitations in RCD (manpower, storage area) and 

ACAD (storage area), however, we believe that at this time, both should have 

already identified their priority activities and the schedule of implementation in 

order that they will be able to effectively carry out one of their core functions, i.e., 

proper disposition of government records.
