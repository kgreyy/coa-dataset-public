EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Archives of the Philippines (NAP) was created by virtue of 

Republic Act (RA) No. 9470 dated May 21, 2007, an Act strengthening the system 

of management and administration of archival records. It is mandated to plan, 

develop, prescribe, disseminate and enforce policies, rules and regulations and 

coordinate government-wide programs governing the creation, general protection, 

use, storage and disposition of public records including the acquisition, storage and 

preservation of public archives and providing facilities for reference, research or for 

other similar purposes. 
 

NAP was first established as the Office of Archives under the Treaty of Paris 

dated December 10, 1898 and later the Bureau of Archives under the Philippine 

Commission Act No.  273 dated October 21, 1901. The Bureau of Archives was 

reduced to a division which was later integrated with the Philippine Library and 

Museum as the Bureau of Records Management and later renamed as Records 

Management and Archives Office (RMAO) in 1972. RMAO was re-established as 

a cultural agency attached to the Department of Education, Culture and Sports 

under Executive Order (EO) No. 285 dated July 25, 1987 but subsequently 

transferred to the Office of the President, attached to the National Commission for 

Culture and the Arts (NCCA) under EO No. 80 dated March 15, 1999. 
 

At present, NAP is an independent agency attached to the NCCA for 

budgetary purposes. It is headed by Executive Director Victorino M. Manalo who 

is assisted by a Deputy Executive Director. It has six divisions namely: 1) Training 

and Information Division (TID); 2) Archives Collection and Access Division 

(ACAD); 3) Records Center Division (RCD); 4) Records Management and 

Services Division (RMSD); 5) Finance and Administrative Division (FAD); and 6) 

Archives Preservation Division (APD). As of December 31, 2020, NAP had a total 

workforce of 142 composed of 128 plantilla positions, 10 contracts of service and 4 

consultancy services.

The Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB) as of December 31, 2020 is shown in Annex A. 
 

 

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of NAP for the 

period January 1 to December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain 

the level of assurance that may be placed on the Management’s assertion on the 

financial statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of 

compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency 

improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior 

year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance 

with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 
 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of NAP as at December 31, 2020. 
 

  

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned 

during the exit conference on April 22, 2021, details of which are further discussed 

in the report. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, 

where appropriate. 

 

1. Non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers (SL) to supplement the details of the 
controlling accounts appearing in the general ledgers (GL) prevented the 

timely reconciliation of relevant records, which is not in accord with Section 

49, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting manual (GAM). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant III to 

maintain SL for each controlling account. 

 

2. The timeline for the submission of outputs/deliverables and the payment 
schedules were not indicated in the Terms of Reference (TOR) for 

consultants; hence, the monthly payments to the consultants may not 

correspond to the outputs delivered. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the members of the 

Bids and Awards Committee to indicate in the TOR the timeline for the 

submission of outputs/deliverables and the payment schedules in hiring 

consultants. 



iv 

 

 

3. The payments to consultants, appraiser and security provider totaling 
₱3,246,362.31 were not adequately supported with necessary documents such 

as accomplishment and appraiser reports, approved final report and daily time 

records, in violation of Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445; hence, propriety of 

transactions was not completely ascertained. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned payees 

and agency personnel to submit the lacking documents to the Audit Team. 

 

4. Payment of salaries for contractual personnel totaling ₱2,943,483.43 was 
made through cash advances, inconsistent with DBM Circular Letter No. 

2013-16. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, FAD to 

strictly comply with the DBM Circular in the payment of salaries. 

 

5. The agency paid the security provider twice for the same man-hours rendered 
by the same security guards, resulting in overpayment of ₱6,672.22. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant III to 

deduct from the subsequent billing of the security provider the overpayment 

of ₱6,672.22. 

 

6. Recurring audit observations that remained unresolved for years such as (a) 
non-submission of bank reconciliation statements (BRS), (b) cash balances 

were not reverted to the General Fund (GF), and (c) non-reconciliation of 

property records manifest lack of accountability among the concerned officers 

and employees. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) Accountant III to: 
 

i. submit at once the BRS for CY 2020; and 
ii. prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to take up the reversion of 

unused funds to the General Fund; 

 

b) Accountant III and the Property and Supply Officer to update their 
records, to facilitate the reconciliation of said records with the physical 

count; and 

 

c) Inventory Committee to prioritize in 2021 the conduct of physical count of 
all the assets of the agency. 

 



v 

 

Moreover, we recommended and the Executive Director agreed to investigate 

and as warranted, hold officers and employees accountable for continually 

failing to act on the reported observations. 

 

7. The agency’s annual target of 15 government offices with approved/updated 
RDS is deemed too few considering that 409 agencies still have no RDS, 

resulting in the absence of guidelines for the retention and disposition of their 

substantive records. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, Records 

Management and Services Division (RMSD) to continue making 

representation with the heads of government agencies with no RDS and to set 

a considerable increment of yearly target of agencies. 

 

8. Absence of operational guidelines prevented the Inventory and Scheduling 
Section (ISS) to conduct the records management audit every five years, 

which is not in accord with Section 29 of RA No. 9470 of 2007, resulting in 

non-determination of the adherence by government agencies to policies on 

records management. 

 

We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to create an audit 

committee to formulate the operational guidelines for the records management 

audit that shall be conducted by the Inspection and Scheduling Section. 

 

9. The lack of concrete transfer and disposal plan in the Records Center Division 
(RCD) resulted in the accumulation of (a) permanent records that should have 

been transferred to the Archives Collection and Access Division (ACAD) for 

their preservation, (b) records from abolished/defunct agencies for re-

appraisal, and (c) records for safekeeping and/or with referrals which could 

not be disposed of. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) instruct the Chief, RCD to: 
 

i. immediately transfer the permanent records to ACAD; 
ii. prepare an action plan that includes the timeline and prioritization of 

appraisal activities of all records from abolished/defunct agencies; 

and 

iii. propose a supplemental policy on records for safekeeping and/or 
with referrals (e.g., final retention period in the storage area and 

immediate removal of records from the storage area), for the 

approval of the Executive Director; and 

 

b) require the Chief, ACAD to augment the existing storage area for 
permanent records from the RCD.

G. Summary of Audit Suspension, Disallowances and Charges at year end.  
 

As of December 31, 2020, there was no unsettled suspension, while unsettled 

disallowances totaled ₱102,417.91. 
 

 

H. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 54 audit recommendations contained in the Annual Audit Report 

(AAR) for CY 2019, 47 were implemented and seven (7) were not implemented. 

The details are presented in Part III of this report.
