Thus, the Auditor rendered an Unmodified Opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of Nueva Vizcaya State University for the year ended December 31, 2020.



E)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations



The observations and recommendations were discussed with the management through the issuance of Audit Observation Memorandum.  Management comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.  The most significant findings and recommendations are as follows:

1)	The reliability and correctness of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account totaling P932,386,490.26 could not be ascertained due to unreconciled PPE Account balances in the Financial Statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Property Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) amounting to P108,760,188.80 and  no records/ documents available for some PPEs located in Bambang Campus, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445 and Section 15, Chapter 2 of  Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs).



We recommended that Management require the University Accountant and other concerned Accounting personnel to maintain PPE Ledger Cards and the Supply/Property Officer to update the Property Cards pursuant to Chapter 10, Section 42 of the GAM for NGAs.

We also recommended that personnel from each of the accounting and property offices to exert more efforts in order to closely coordinate, and on a regular basis, to make necessary reconciliations and adjustments between the Accounting Records and Property Records to come up with the correct and up to date balance of the PPE. 



2)	Unexpended Fund Transfers from other National Government Agencies (NGAs) amounting to P1,268,914.21 was not yet remitted or returned to the Source Agency after the completion of the intended project or expiration of period of implementation, contrary to the terms and conditions stated in the Memorandum of Agreement and provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13,1994.



We recommended that Management:



a)	require the concerned Project Managers to submit their terminal reports for the preparation of the Final Liquidation Reports and to refund/return immediately the unexpended balance of the funds received from Source Agencies; and



b)	adhere strictly to the provisions set forth in Executive Order No. 87, s. 2019 and COA Circular No. 94-013 pertaining to fund transfers.



3)	The Unreconciled Intra-Agency reciprocal accounts Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds of the University showed a discrepancy of P752,264.35 contrary to the Revised Chart of Accounts under COA Circular No. 2020-001, thus, rendering the balances reflected in the Financial Statement unreliable.



We recommended that the Management instruct the Accountant to:



a)	review the entries made on the reciprocal accounts in the five (5) funds: General Fund, Revolving Fund, Auxiliary Fund, Special Trust Fund and Trust Fund particularly on the previous years to uncover the discrepancies noted;



b.	prepare necessary adjusting entries to bring both accounts in agreement; and 



c.	always ensure the correctness and accuracy of the Intra-Agency reciprocal accounts - Due from Other Funds and Due to Oher Funds accounts to be reported at year-end.



4)	Valuation of the Biological Assets amounting to P1,075,544.90 was understated by P110,481.80 due to non-compliance with the prescribed valuation thereof cited in Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards 27 and COA Circular No. 84-239 dated August 15, 1984.



We recommended that: 



a)	Management constitute an Appraisal Committee to determine the fair values of each kind and each classification of the animal stock for proper valuation, in accordance with PPSAS;



b)	The Project Leaders/Projects-In-Charge/Caretakers maintain complete and accurate logbooks, and submit the required quarterly and annual inventory reports to the Accountant, Property Officer, copy furnished the Auditor, to facilitate the proper valuation and recording of birth/production and mortality of animal stock of the University, in consonance with COA Circular 84-239 and GAM; and



c)	The Accounting Unit adopt and implement the rules and guidelines in the proper costing of the Biological Assets of the University in order to ascertain the correctness in the presentation and reporting of the Biological Assets account in the financial statement.  Adjust the corresponding Biological Asset Accounts to present the correct balance and to maintain ledger cards for the same.



5)	Proper procedures in the approval of Variation Orders amounting to P1,906,049.97 for thirteen (13) awarded projects of the University were not in accordance with the provisions of Annex “E” of Government Procurement Reform Act 9184.



We recommended that Management ensure strict adherence of the provision of RA 9184 with regard to the preparation and submission of variation orders. Failure to follow the rules in the issuance of variation order and failure to submit the required documents shall constitute a waiver by the contractor for any claim.
