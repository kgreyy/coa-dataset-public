PART II - DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial and Compliance Audit



1)	The reliability and correctness of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account totaling P932,386,490.26 could not be ascertained due to unreconciled PPE Account balances in the Financial Statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Property Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) amounting to P108,760,188.80 and no records/documents available for some PPEs located in Bambang Campus, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445 and Section 15, Chapter 2 of  Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs).



1.1	Section 111 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the “State Audit Code of the Philippines” provides that: 



“1. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



 The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.”



1.2	Section 15, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that: 



“The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”



1.3	Section 42 of Chapter 10, Volume I Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) the same Chapter states that:



“The Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledge Receipt (PAR).”



 1.4	Sound property management dictates that the conduct of annual physical inventory count, as well as the preparation of physical inventory report, are indispensable procedures for checking the integrity of the property custodianship and confirm the accuracy of book balances.  Any discrepancies between physical and book inventories must be investigated, cleared and reconciled immediately.  If necessary, written explanations shall be required from accountable persons.



1.5	As at December 31, 2020, the University’s PPE accounts had a total historical cost of P932,386,490.26 in the Statement of Financial Position while the balance of the RPCPPE for Bayombong and Bambang Campuses show a total of P823,626,301.46 (ANNEX “E”) showing a  difference  of  P108,760,188.80 comprising  12% of the total reflected PPE balance at the end of the year.



1.6	The unreconciled amount of P108,760,188.80 was traced in previous year which remained not acted upon or unadjusted in 2020. The computation is presented below:

(P108,760,188.80)

	

1.7	Moreover, review of the RPCPPE of Bambang Campus disclosed that several PPEs were found to have no records as to its acquisition cost and acquisition date. 



1.8	Furthermore, some PPEs listed in the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 totaling to P1,418,805.00 were not reflected  in the Statement of Financial Condition  presumed  to be one of the causes of the discrepancy between the Accounting and Property  records, presented below:

1.9 	Although PCs were prepared and kept by the Property Office, these are incomplete and not updated likewise, the Accounting Office did not maintain PPELC. 



1.10 The non-preparation of PPELCs, un-updated PCs and absence of other available references/records had caused difficulty in reconciling the records between the Accounting and Property Office to come up with a reliable and correct balance of PPE Account appearing in the Financial Statements. 



1.11	We recommended that Management require the University Accountant and other concerned Accounting personnel to maintain PPE Ledger Cards and the Supply/Property Officer to update the Property Cards pursuant to Chapter 10, Section 42 of the GAM for NGAs.



1.12	We also recommended that personnel from each of the accounting and property offices to exert more efforts in order to closely coordinate, and on a regular basis, to make necessary reconciliations and adjustments between the Accounting Records and Property Records to come up with the correct and up to date balance of the PPE. 



1.13	Management committed to comply with the audit recommendation as an initial activity prior to the conduct of inventory taking.  They committed to address the perennial issue of enormous amounts of discrepancies in the PPE account balances. 



2)	Eight (8) out of twelve (12) copies of government contracts awarded through public bidding and their supporting documents amounting to P39,130,035.91 were not submitted to the Commission on Audit as required under COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thereby, precluded the Auditor to conduct auditorial and legal review and communicating the audit results thereof.



2.1	Sections 3.1 and 3.2, COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 (restatement with amendment of COA Circular No. 87-278 and COA Memorandum 2005-027) require that:



“3.1 Contracts 



3.1.1	Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.  In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company, as the case may be.



 xxx 



 3.2.1 A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from the issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.  Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to Management defects and/ or deficiencies, if any in the same manner provided in the second and third sentences of the item 3.1.4 hereof”



2.2	Records show that the Audit Team were not furnished a copy of the contracts and their supporting documents for projects being implemented within the University.  Out of twelve (12) contracts entered into by Management for 2020, only four(4) were submitted for contract review (ANNEX“F”), thereby impeding the timely validation and complete evaluation as to compliance and observance with existing procurement regulations affecting the validity of these transactions. Copies of the documents required to be submitted shall include but not limited to the following. (Section 3.2.1 of said Circular):



  		      “a.	    Invitation to bid

a)	Letter of Demand

b)	Eligibility Documents and eligibility data sheet

c)	Eligibility requirements

d)	Results of eligibility Checks/screening

e)	Bidding Documents (Sec 17.1, IRRA –A, RA 9184)

f)	Minutes of Pre-bid conference if applicable

g)	Agenda and/or Supplemental Bid Bulletins

h)	Bidders Technical and Financial Proposals

i)	Minutes of Bid Opening

j)	Abstract of Bids

k)	Post qualification report of TWG

l)	BAC resolution declaring winning bidder

m)	Notice of Post Qualification

n)	BAC Resolution recommending approval

o)	Notice of Award

p)	Contract Agreement

q)	Performance Security

r)	Program of Work and detailed estimates

s)	Certificate of Availability of Funds, obligation request

t)	Notice to Proceed

u)	Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the audit review and technical evaluation.”



2.3	 Thus, the Audit Team reiterate the following provision in Section 4.0 of said Circular, which provides that:



       “4.0 Penalty Clause



4.1 Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees    concerned to comply with the requirements of the herein imposed shall be subject to administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.”



2.4	The submission of all perfected contracts together with the supporting documents within the prescribed period is necessary to implement a systematic and effective contract review process to generate timely and relevant audit results. 



2.5	We recommended that Management require the officials responsible to strictly adhere with the afore-cited COA Circular 2009-001 and observe compliance through submission of copies of contracts entered into by the University together with the required supporting documents.



2.6	Management committed to submit the perfected contracts and assured us the early submission of copies of contracts.



3)	Paid disbursements vouchers and liquidation reports in an aggregate sum of P13,142,451.69 were  not submitted for audit within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), thus, hampered the audit team to render timely audit decisions, which could have improved the operations of the University.



3.1	Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 states that:



“Disbursing officers in particular shall faithfully comply with Section 100 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 which require them to render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to existing auditing regulations not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned.”



3.2	Also, Item 7.2.1 of COA Circular 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribing the use of the rules and regulations on settlement of accounts state that:



“The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that:



a)	the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.”



3.3	Further, GAM for NGAs prescribed the following deadlines on the submission of reports:





Statement/Report

3.4	Despite these provisions, the Accounting Office and the Cashier’s Office, and other concerned officials still incur delays in the submission of Disbursement Vouchers and Liquidations Reports. The table below presents the percentage of unsubmitted disbursement vouchers which ranges from 10-37% of the total vouchers to be submitted within the prescribed period:

3.6	The detailed list of disbursement vouchers is attached as ANNEX “G”. 



3.7 Delayed submission of disbursement vouchers with supporting pertinent documents together with the financial reports precluded the Audit Team from timely audit examination, verification and analysis to determine the propriety, validity, legality and completeness of the transactions, including the accuracy and integrity of financial reports of the University causing domino effect in the issuance of Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) to Management for comment/s.



3.8	We recommended that the University Accountant, Cashier and all other concerned personnel must observe the prescribed submission dates of mandatory reports for the timely conduct of audit and final custody.



3.9	Management directed the concerned personnel to submit the documents pertinent to the request. However, with the implementation of strict quarantine protocols and   lockdown at NVSU to protect the employees from wide spreading of the COVID 19 Virus in the Campus, the submission of the documents could not be done immediately.  In addition, Management committed to exercise due diligence in retrieving some documents still missing at the moment. 



3.10	As of this date, the submission of DV had improved of which total unsubmitted DVs went down to  P3,118,018.42 consisting of   P2,943,039.07  for  2020 and  P174,979.35 pertaining to previous year.



4)	Advances for Payroll, Advances to Special Disbursing Officer and Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P1,196.01, P8,129,632.56, and P32,210.63, respectively, remained unsettled at year-end contrary to Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 and COA Circular 97-002 dated February 5, 1997.



4.1	Section 89 of PD 1445 otherwise known as the “Government Auditing Code of the Philippines” provides limitations on cash advance which states that:



“No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.”



4.2	Provisions of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 5, 1997 which provides for further guidelines in the liquidation of cash advances states that:



“5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



5.9 At the start of an ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash advance is submitted. However, when no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO's salary.”



4.3	All cash advances must be liquidated upon the purpose for which it was granted is served. And in case the purpose has not been served or a balance is unutilized thereof, the same must be refunded also at the end of the year, whether intended for salary, wages, etc., petty operating expenses, current operating expenses, or official travels. In other words, at the end of the year, all cash advances must have been liquidated or refunded.



4.4	Review of the financial statements disclosed that unliquidated cash advances as at year-end totaled to P8,163,039.20 (ANNEX “H”). Comparison of figures between 2019 and 2020 showed that there was an increase of P3,718,570.11 despite prior year’s recommendation of strict compliance on liquidations of cash advances where management ensured the adherence thereto.

4.5	Despite of strict monitoring thru the issuance of Demand Letters by Management on a quarterly basis and the Demand Letters issued by the Audit Team on the outstanding balances of cash advances, the amount of unliquidated cash advances at year-end is still alarming. A careful perusal of the submitted Schedule of Cash Advances and inquiry with the Management lead to the following:



4.5.1	Advances to Officers and Employees ending December 31, 2020 disclosed that these accounts are prior years, dating 2005 and 2008. And that these employees are no longer connected with the University, thus, the non-settlement on their accounts. COA Circular No. 2016-005,dated December 19, 2016 which prescribes, among others, the general guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning of the books of accounts of dormant unliquidated cash advances, provides that these accounts may be categorized as those which could already be requested for write-off.



4.5.2	Advances to Special Disbursing Officer remained unliquidated are the result of accumulated cash advances granted mostly during the last quarter of the year. These comprises of financial assistance and stipends of students which was released as a Cash Advance to Special Disbursing Officer at year-end to secure the fund from automatic reversion of unspent fund to the Bureau of Treasury that eventually may deprive the grantees from the  benefits they could have received.



4.5.3	The recording of expenses to their proper account classifications could not be attained as a result of non-settlement by the concerned accountable officers of their cash advances, which affects the reliability of the related accounts. 



4.5.4	It was also observed that some cash advances were granted to accountable officers whose previous cash advances were not yet liquidated, which contributed to the accumulation of the unliquidated cash advances.



4.6	The delayed or non-liquidation of cash advances, most especially during year end, resulted to the following:



4.6.1	Overstatement of the Equity Account, and understatement of the corresponding Expense Accounts;



4.6.2	It affects the reliability of the respective financial reports of the corresponding funds since the expenses or disbursements were recorded later than when they were actually incurred;  



4.6.3	The unspent balances which the Accountable Officers (AO) failed to refund immediately are exposed to possible misappropriation or misuse; and



4.6.4	The University was deprived of any income or benefit which these may have earned if these were redeposited in the bank or if utilized for any legal purpose which these are authorized to be used.



4.7	We recommended that Management require all the Accountable Officers concerned to immediately liquidate or refund their outstanding cash advances as at December 31, 2020 pursuant to Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 and COA Circular 97-002 dated February 5, 1997. Appropriate charges shall be filed against erring officials for failure to settle their cash advances if warranted.



4.8	We also recommended that Management request for the write-off of the dormant accounts eligible under COA Circular No. 2016-005.



5)	Proper procedures in the approval of Variation Orders amounting to P1,906,049.97 for thirteen (13) awarded projects of the University were not in accordance with the provisions of Annex “E” of Government Procurement Reform Act 9184.



5.1	Annex E of the Republic Act (RA) 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act states that:

	

“1.1. Variation Orders may be issued by the procuring entity to cover any increase/decrease in quantities, including the introduction of new work items that are not included in the original contract or reclassification of work items that are either due to change of plans, design or alignment to suit actual field conditions resulting in disparity  between the preconstruction plans used for purposes of bidding and the “as staked plans” or construction drawings prepared after a joint survey by the contractor and the Government after award of the contract, provided that the cumulative amount of the positive or additive Variation Order does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the original contract price.  The addition/deletion of works under Variation Orders should be within the general scope of the project as bid and awarded.  The scope of works shall not be reduced so as to accommodate a positive Variation Order.  A Variation Order may either be in the form of either change order or extra work order.”

		

5.2	Furthermore, the same Annex obliges that:

		

“1.5. In claiming for any Variation Order within seven (7) calendar days after such work has been commenced pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof; or, within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after the circumstances or reasons justifying a claim for extra cost shall have occurred, deliver a notice giving full and detailed particulars of any extra cost in order that it may be investigated at that time. Failure to provide either of such notices in the time stipulated shall constitute a waiver by the contractor for any claim. The preparation and submission of Variation Orders are as follows: 

		

a)	If the procuring entity’s representative/Project Engineer believes that a Change Order or Extra Work Order should be issued, he shall prepare the proposed Order accompanied with the notices submitted by the contractor, the plans therefore, his computations as to the quantities of the additional works involved per item indicating the specific stations where such works are needed, the date of his inspections and investigations thereon, and the log book thereof, and a detailed estimate of the unit cost of such items of work, together with his justifications for the need of such Change Order or Extra Work Order, and shall submit the same to the Head of the Procuring Entity for approval. 

		

b)	The Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative upon receipt of the proposed Change Order or Extra Work Order shall immediately instruct the technical staff or office of the procuring entity to conduct an on-the-spot investigation to verify the need for the work to be prosecuted and to review the proposed plans, and prices of the work involved. 

		

c)	 The technical staff of appropriate office of the procuring entity shall submit report of their findings and recommendations, together with the supporting documents, to the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative for consideration.

		

d)	The Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative, acting upon the recommendation of the technical staff or appropriate office shall approve the Change Order or Extra Work Order after being satisfied that the same is justified, necessary, and in order

		

e)	The timeframe for the processing of Variation Orders from the preparation up to the approval by the procuring entity concerned shall not exceed thirty (30) calendar days. 

		

5.3	Audit of various infrastructure projects conducted disclosed that there are thirteen (13) projects implemented by the Nueva Vizcaya State University (NVSU), with variation orders, presented in the table below:

5.4	Review on the documents submitted (ANNEX “I”) revealed the following:

		

Documents to support variation orders

Present

Absent

--	Notice from contractor justifying claim for variation order



--	

--	Proposed Order





--	Plans with detailed computation of quantities indicating specific station

--	



--	Date of inspection/ logbook



--	

--	Justifications for the need of such change order/extra work



--	

--	Report from technical staff the findings and recommendations



--	

--	Approval from Head of procuring entity after being satisfied that variation order is justified, necessary and in order. 

--	





5.5	It can be inferred from the above table that the required documents before processing the variation orders were not submitted.  Inquiry with the Physical Plant and Site Development Office disclosed that the request for variation orders were made verbally by the contractor. The Management did not maintain a logbook to support the on spot inspection and investigation, hence, we could not verify the date of the inspection and investigation thereon.  Only the approved Variation Orders were attached to the contract submitted to the Audit Team.  



5.6	Absence of these documents signified that the proper procedure in the preparation and approval of Variation Orders prescribed in RA 9184 is not being adhered to by the concerned personnel of the University.



5.7	We recommended that Management ensure the strict adherence of the provision of RA 9184 with regard to the preparation and submission of variation orders. Failure to follow the rules in claiming variation order and submit the required documents shall constitute a waiver by the contractor for any claim. 



5.8	Management committed to adhere to our recommendation.



6)	Unexpended Fund Transfers from other National Government Agencies (NGAs) amounting to P1,268,914.21 was not yet remitted or returned to the Source Agency after the completion of the project intended to or expiration of period of implementation, contrary to the terms and conditions stated in the Memorandum of Agreement and provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994.



6.1	Due to NGAs account is used to lodge the fund transfers from other National Government Agencies as Source Agencies (SA) in pursuit of their programs/projects in cooperation with the University as Implementing Agency (IA).  The balance represents the liability of the University to the said source agencies and is subject for liquidation.



6.2	Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies (COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provide the following guidelines:



“4. General Guidelines



4.9	The Implementing Agency (IA) shall return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance upon completion of the project.



            xxx



6.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Implementing Agencies

	

6.7	return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.”

	

6.3	The University received fund as a joint partner of the national agencies such as: DOST, DOH PITAHC, DA, etc., for the implementation of various research undertaking/training for the development of new programs/projects, covered by a memorandum of agreement. In the implementation of these undertakings, the funds received from the Source Agencies shall be managed by the designated Project Team headed by a Project Team Leader.



6.4	Audit of the Due to NGAs Account disclosed that the University has unexpended fund transfers from other national government agencies amounting to P1,268,914.21 which remained in the books for more than two years and not yet remitted to the SA upon  completion and/or expiration of the period of implementation, presented in the table below:

6.6	As shown in the above table, not all SAs mandated that the University has to remit the unexpended balance of the fund received from them upon project completion and to submit the Project Terminal Report with an Audited Financial Reports. However, the provision of COA Circular 94-013 explicitly asserts the IA obligation to return or remit the unused balance of the fund transfers from other national agencies to the SA. 



6.7	Interview disclosed that the required Project Managers’ Terminal Reports were not submitted to the Accounting Office hindering the preparation of the Final Liquidation Reports of the funds received. The unjustified  delay of the terminal reports   attributed to failure  to remit  the unexpended balance of the fund transfers  amounting to  P1,268,914.21 to concerned SAs considering that any unspent balance of government funds are to be    remitted   to the Bureau of Treasury pursuant to Executive Order No. 87,s. 2019.



6.8	This is a reiteration of prior year audit observation of which the University did not implement the recommendation. 



6.9	We recommended that Management:



6.9.1	require the concerned  Project Managers to submit their terminal reports for the preparation of the Final Liquidation Reports and to refund/return immediately  the unexpended balance of the funds to the  Source Agencies; and



6.9.2	adhere strictly to the provisions set forth in Executive Order No. 87, s. 2019 and COA Circular No. 94-013 pertaining to fund transfers.



6.10	Management informed the Audit Team that the Project Managers have started submitting Terminal Reports for the preparation of the Final Liquidation Reports as a pre-requisite in returning/refunding the unexpended balances to the Source Agencies. The proof or evidence of refund to the Source Agency shall be submitted to the Audit Team for monitoring purposes.



7)	The reliability and accuracy of the Inventories Accounts totaling P1,621,509.61 could not be ascertained due to the un-reconciled Inventory account balances in the Accounting and Supply Records amounting to P812,442.70 and non-maintenance of Supply Ledger Cards by the Accounting Office, contrary to Sections 9 and 13 (par. 3), Chapter 8, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.



7.1	Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM states that:



“Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.”



7.2	As at December 31, 2020, the Inventories accounts had a total cost of P1,621,509.61 while the balance reflected in the submitted RPCI was only P809,066.91, showing a disagreement of P812,442.70 or 50% of the total reflected Inventory balance.

	

7.3	It was observed that the Accounting Office did not maintain SLCs as required by GAM.  Such non-maintenance hampered the verification of the movement of Inventory accounts such as deliveries, issuances to ascertain the correct balances at year-end.

7.4	Furthermore, comparison of the submitted RPCI and balance per Financial Statements revealed that Inventories for Revolving Fund and Auxiliary Fund in the amount of P211,757.30 and P603,818.20, respectively, were not found in the RPCI. The unreconciled balance of the Revolving Fund may be attributed to previous years’ findings relating to Agricultural and Marine Supplies Inventory with missing documents. Such discrepancy remained unaccounted in the University Books of Accounts affecting the reliability and correctness of the reported balance at year-end.



7.5	We recommended that the University Accountant require the concerned personnel in the Accounting Office to maintain Supplies Ledger Cards pursuant to Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs.



7.6	We also recommended that personnel from each of the two (2) Offices: Accounting and Property, closely coordinate with each other and on a regular basis, make necessary reconciliations and adjustments between the Accounting Records and the Supply/Property Records to come up with the correct and up to date balance of the Inventories.



7.7	Management agreed to comply with the recommendations and informed the Audit Team that reconciliation between Accounting and Property Office is now in progress.



8)	The Unreconciled Intra-Agency reciprocal accounts Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds of the University showed a discrepancy of P752,264.35 contrary to the Revised Chart of Accounts under COA Circular No. 2020-001, thus, rendering the balances reflected in the Financial Statement unreliable.



8.1	COA Circular No. 2020-001, dated January 8, 2020, prescribes the use of the updated Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) under Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs). The revised chart of accounts thereby describes Due from Other Funds as an account used to recognize transfers to other funds and/or receivables from other funds of the agency, while Due to Other Funds as account used to recognize transfers from other funds and/or payables to other funds.  Therefore, Due from Other Funds account is the amount of advance to other funds, while Due to Other Funds is the amount to be used to record receipt of funds from other one fund maintained by the same agency. Both accounts are classified as Intra-Agency reciprocal accounts which require a debit entry to one fund and the corresponding credit entry to another, thus, a zero effect upon consolidation of the financial statements.



8.2	Audit of the Detailed Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 showed that the balances of the reciprocal accounts have discrepancies in the amount of P752,264.35, breakdown as follows:

8.4	Based on the data presented above, the amount of discrepancy decreased by P30,754.27 at the end of the year. However, transfers made to different funds noted significant increases. Further verification disclosed that the increase in discrepancy was brought about by the following:



8.4.1	All UniFAST Scholarship Funds received from Commission on Higher Education (CHED) are entered in the Books of Account intended for Special Trust Fund (STF) of the University.  Income such as: Guidance Fee, Medical Fee, NSTP Fee, etc. were recognized under this fund as Due from Other Funds by the University Accountant to pay for the different expenses that are recorded under other funds, i.e. (1) Guidance Fee, Medical Fee NSTP Fee, etc. for Trust Fund (2) ID Fee for Auxiliary Fund

		

8.4.2	Taxes withheld from payment of procured goods from Department of Budget and Management (DBM) were also remitted using the STF, as recommended by Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and DBM that only one source of fund should be used to pay for the said expenses. Thus, other funds of the University were charged with the payments made through the STF thereby increasing the transfers between funds being made. These transactions are being closely monitored.



8.4.3	Due to the reclassification in the charging of school fees set by the CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, s. 2011 – Policies and guidelines for the use of income, special trust fund and program of receipts and expenditures of the State Universities and Colleges.  As such, the movement of all receipts and collections accruing to the general income for use in operations, fiduciary funds, income generating or self-liquidating operations or activities, and regular funds and the difference in the recognition of the Student Information and Accounting System (SIAS) of such receipts and collections caused the un-reconciled balance.



8.4.4	Erroneous/Double recording of collections in Revolving and Auxiliary Funds or other funds.



8.5	If not properly monitored, the difference in these accounts could result in more errors in the future.  Due to the discrepancies noted, the balances of the reciprocal accounts appearing in the financial statements are not reliable.



8.6	We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to:



8.6.1	review the entries made on the reciprocal accounts in the five (5) funds: General Fund, Revolving Fund, Auxiliary Fund, Special Trust Fund and Trust Fund particularly on the previous years to uncover the discrepancies noted;



8.6.2	prepare necessary adjusting entries to bring both accounts into agreement; and 



8.6.3	always ensure the correctness and accuracy of the Intra-Agency reciprocal accounts - Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds accounts to be reported at year-end.



8.7	Management admitted this observation. The Accounting Staff committed to trace the discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustments immediately, if warranted.



8.8	Submission of the related JEVs effecting the adjustments to the Audit Team is required for review purposes.



9)	Request for Relief from Accountability amounting to P230,809.85 was not filed by the concerned personnel which is contrary to Section 73 (1) of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24,1992.



9.1	Section 73 (1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) 1445 cites that:



“When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefor or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with available supporting evidence.   Whenever warranted by the evidence, credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts.”



9.2	COA Memorandum 92-751 dated February 24, 1992 provides the following documents in order to facilitate the evaluation and decision on applications for relief from accountability, among others: 



"1. The basic notice of loss to be filed immediately after the discovery of the loss and the request for relief from accountability which should be filed by the proper accountable officer within the reglementary period of 30 days from the occurrence of the loss, with the Auditor concerned or the Commission, as the case may be.

	1.1	In case of delay in the filing of the aforesaid notice and request, satisfactory explanation or the reason(s) for such delay should be submitted, after which the reasons/explanation given should be verified or confirmed by the Auditor concerned.

	1.2 If the occurrence of the loss has also been reported to other police agencies, like the N.B.I., C.I.S., etc., the progress/final investigation report thereon should be submitted.

2. Affidavit or Sworn Statement of the proper accountable officer on the facts and circumstances surrounding the said loss, supported by the Affidavit of two (2) disinterested persons who have personal knowledge of such fact of loss;



3. Comment and/or recommendation of the Agency Head concerned on the request;



4. Exact or accurate amount of government cash or book value of the property, subject of the request for relief;



5. Memorandum Receipts covering the properties subject of the request, if any.”



9.3	In addition to the afore-cited documents, these are further required for submission in cases of loss due to theft or death of livestock:







“THEFT OR ROBBERY/HOLD-UP:



1.	Progress and/or Final Police report on the theft or robbery case.

2.	Detailed list of government properties lost or destroyed as well as those properties retrieved after the robbery incident disclosing the book value of each item or exact amount of government money/cash involved, duly verified by the proper Auditor

3.	Authenticated picture(s) taken relative to the robbery or theft incident.



DEATH OF LARGE CATTLE AND OTHER LIVESTOCK:

1.	Certificate of Death of the large cattle issued by the proper official, duly verified by the Auditor concerned; and

2.	Autopsy report of the proper Veterinarian, if any.”



9.4	COA Memorandum 92-751 dated February 24, 1992 stresses the importance of submission of request for relief together with the supporting documents, to wit:



“It bears emphasizing that under Section 73 of PD 1445, the application for relief from accountability should be accompanied by" available supporting evidence"; that credit for the loss contemplated therein shall be allowed only "whenever warranted by the evidence"; and that non-compliance with such requirement is a bar to the grant of the relief applied for.”



9.5	During the conduct of inventory count on the property and livestock of NVSU, the Audit Team noted the following:

9.6	The nine (9) dead animals and missing three (3) projectors were not communicated to the Audit Team and there were no requests for relief   submitted filed for the conduct of investigation necessary in the granting of relief to the accountable officer/employee or to effect an audit decision as mandated by Section 73 (1) of PD 1445.   



9.7	Inquiry with Management disclosed that the death of these animals was included in their Monthly Inventory Report submitted to the Accounting to effect the changes in the financial statement, but the Bookkeepers confirmed that only Swine Production has submitted their monthly report.  They further disclosed that the accountable persons have already acknowledged their liabilities for the missing three (3) projectors.



9.8	However, it bears emphasizing the need to submit a satisfactory explanation or the reason(s) for such delay.  The requirements for the request of accountability which are expected to be regularly accomplished as basic documentation are important to determine the person/s liable and properly account the loss in the Book of Accounts if such loss was due to negligence of the accountable officer.  Outright admission of fault or negligence would not resolve the issue.





9.9	We recommended that Management require the concerned personnel to request for relief from accountability and submit the documentary requirements together with the written explanations/reasons for such delay for evaluation. Further, if the accountable person has admitted his fault or negligence for the missing projectors then the Audit Team shall make of recommendation to the Agency Head after due evaluation for the drawing of Journal Voucher to recognize a  Receivable Account for the amount  due them.





9.10	Henceforth, we recommended that Management must be strict in the implementation and observance of the guidelines and procedures in the request for relief from accountability in order to properly and timely account for such losses and deaths.



9.11Management adhered to our recommendations through an action plan presented below:

10)	Valuation of the Biological Assets amounting to P1,075,544.90 was understated by P110,481.80 due to non-compliance with the prescribed valuation thereof cited in Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards 27 and COA Circular No. 84-239 dated August 15, 1984.



10.1	Philippines Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) defines biological assets as a living animal or plant, while agricultural produce is the harvested product of the entity’s biological assets.  



10.2	Biological asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell, while agricultural produce harvested from an entity’s biological assets shall be measured at its fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest.  Particularly, the standards states the basis of fair value to which the animal stocks of the University may be applied, as follows:

	“If an active market exists for biological asset or agricultural produce in its present location and condition, the quoted price in that market is the appropriate basis for determining the fair value of that asset.  If the entity has access to different markets, the entity uses the most relevant one.  For example, if an entity has access to two active markets, it would use the price existing in the market expected to be used.”

10.3	Parallel to this, COA Circular No. 84-239 dated August 15, 1984 outlines the proper reporting of animal products acquired and produced as follows:

“1.6. x x x.  In the absence of such industry standards, each agency head shall constitute an Appraisal Committee to develop a cost 



system for each variety or specie of animal on the basis of prevailing market prices.

1.7. Upon reaching marketable or maturity age and once their purpose has been determined; the offsprings of animals shall be transferred to appropriate accounts.

1.8. Animals which perish or are issued for institutional use or consumption shall be supported by a properly approved Requisition and Issue Voucher (RIV) and dropped from the inventory account.  In case of loss, a request from relief from accountability shall be made.  Loss due to the negligence of the accountable officer concerned shall be chargeable against him and the amount to be refunded shall be based on the prevailing market value determined by an Appraisal Committee created by the Agency Head concerned.



	X x x.



1.12. Large animals should be appraised quarterly and/or at the time of disposal. A report on the appraised/ standard cost determined shall be submitted by the Appraisal Committee of the Agency Head. Copy furnished Property Officer.  The Chief Accountant shall prepare journal voucher to adjust the inventory/investment/fixed asset account for livestock to its appraised value.  The property officer shall likewise update the property ledger card based on the appraisal/standard cost report.



1.13. A Monthly Report of Inventory shall be prepared for animals and poultry products within 10 days after the end of the month, copy furnished the Chief Accountant.



1.14. In the case of death of offspring, the project manager shall likewise submit a report to the Agency Head within 2 days.  The report shall also state the value of the animal stating therein, causes/reasons of death and other necessary details.  The report shall also be accomplished in five (5) copies to be distributed as follows:

			Original	-	Agency Head

		 	Copy 1		-	Accounting

			Copy 2		-	Property Officer

			Copy 3		-	Cashier

			Copy 4		-	File of Project Manager”



10.4	Biological assets presented in the financial statements for the years 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

10.5	Analysis of the account showed that line items: Trees, Plants and Crops under Bearer Biological Assets; Consumable Biological Assets-Trees, Plants and Crops for Consumption/Sale/Distribution; and Agricultural Produce Held for Consumption/Sale/Distribution totaling to P489,753.20 remained the same compared to previous year denoting that increases in value brought by physical change and changes in prices as well decreases due to death or cost of sales were not accounted for in the books.  The actual breakdown of this amount cannot be determined due to absence of ledger cards to support the balances presented. 



10.6	In the conduct of physical count, the Audit Team noted the following deficiencies:



a)	Thirty-one (31) native pigs which consists of breeding, adult and small were not recorded in the book of accounts;



b)	No proper appraisal made on each class or kind and biological assets and these were still measured on its initial cost due to absence of gathered information on applicable fair values of the following:



--	Large Cattle

--	Olericulture/Pomology

--	Trees, Plants and Crops Held for  Consumption/Sale/Distribution

--	 Agricultural Produce Held for Consumption/Sale/Distribution



c)	Overstatement in the books were also caused by unrecorded death of Sheep and Goat amounting to P9,000.00 and P2,500.00, respectively, and by modification in the appraisal value of Cattles amounting to P22,000.00 ( ANNEX “J”).

10.7	Inquiry with the Bookkeeper assigned to handle Biological Assets Account revealed that no adjustments were made to reflect any increase or decrease of this account due to the non-submission of the quarterly report of Biological Assets by the Project Leaders. However, based on the information gathered, the Project Leaders/Caretakers do maintain logbooks to account for the inventory of the animal stocks, trees, plants and stocks but these were not submitted to the Accounting and Property mentioned in the afore-cited circular for adjustments. 



10.8	Likewise, gains or losses due to physical or price changes were not recognized through the year due to failure of the Caretakers’ or Project Leaders to prepare Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) containing, among others, the balances at the beginning of the quarter and the changes in fair value of the biological assets due to growth, degeneration, production, and procreation as prescribed by the Government Accounting Manual (GAM).  



10.9	The improper valuation of these assets, as well as the non-recognition of gains or losses due to death, consumption, production or growth of these assets reduces the reliability of the Biological Assets Account presented as at year-end. 



10.10	We recommended that: 



a)	Management constitute an Appraisal Committee to determine the fair values of each kind and each classification of the animal stock for proper valuation, in accordance with PPSAS;



b)	The Project Leaders/Projects-In-Charge/Caretakers maintain complete and accurate logbooks, and submit the required quarterly and annual inventory reports to the Accountant, Property Officer, copy furnished the Auditor, to facilitate the proper valuation and recording of birth/production and mortality of animal stock of the University, in consonance with COA Circular 84-239 and GAM; and



c)	The Accounting Unit adopt and implement the rules and guidelines in the proper costing of the Biological Assets of the University in order to ascertain the correctness in the presentation and reporting of the Biological Assets account in the financial statement.  Adjust the corresponding Biological Asset Accounts to present the correct balance and to maintain ledger cards for the same.



10.11	Management commented that they already instructed the Project Leaders/Projects-In-Charge/Caretakers to maintain documents that will support the property and determine the current FMV.  Management further commented that this is a continuing effort and assured the Audit Team of a regular updating on the entries in the book as soon as they were provided with the basis of valuation.



11)	Absence of University policy on the grant of communication expenses to project leaders and staff of the various special projects have resulted to excessive claims/reimbursements of communication expenses.



11.1	COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 provides the Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Illegal, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures. Section 5.1 thereof defines “Excessive Expenditures” as those unreasonable expenses or expenses incurred at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price.  It also includes expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses in excess of reasonable limits.



11.2	Post-audit of disbursement vouchers under the trust fund disclosed that a total of P313,780.00 gross of tax, (see ANNEX “K-1”) was disbursed for the payment of communication expenses from January 1 to December 2020 for special projects.   



11.3	It was observed that members of the project were given cell cards out of the project fund.  Likewise, even those who are neither members of the team nor directly involved in the project such as administrative personnel were granted from P100 to P500 cell cards. 



11.4	Furthermore, our observation on the grants of cell cards revealed the following:



a)	There were 17 project leaders/ members and even administrative staffs who are handling more than one special projects claimed communication expenses from each project (ANNEX “K-2”);



b)		There were 10 personnel who are receiving monthly communication expense of P600.00 from Special Trust Fund (STF)in relation to their function were also given cell cards from the project. (ANNEX “K-3”);



c)		Cell cards amounting to P45,485.00 were not duly acknowledged by recipients. (ANNEX “K-4”); and



d)		Cell card amounting to P23,655.00 was given only to a single project leader. 

 

11.5	The Project Leaders justified the grant to them due to close coordination needed in the processing of procurements and other financial transactions particularly financial reports preparation and processing of vouchers.  



11.6	Inquiry from the Management disclosed that the cell cards given to project Team Leaders/Members and administrative Staff were not supported by any resolution or guidelines authorizing such.  The University’s operating manual does not specifically provide policies on the grant of communication expenses to its personnel other than those granted to University Officers of P600 per month.  Due to absence of appropriate policies and guidelines on the grant communication expenses, distribution of cell cards rests in the discretion of the project leader.  The Management of NVSU was left with no valid or concrete basis for the determination and fixing of monthly rates and subsequent increases thereto. This practice may be prejudicial to the project and to other NVSU personnel, and there’s a possibility of abuse thereof. 



11.7	The two leading network providers, Globe and Smart, offers call and text plan packages, allowing unlimited communications to same and/or other network.  Based on our research, the minimum package can be availed ranging from P599.00 to a maximum of P2,999.00 per month. (ANNEX “K-5”). Also, it has to be noted that the University has upgraded its internet systems including installation of telephones in each office with the objective of improving communication and coordination among University personnel and its clientele.  These also covered the Research and Entrepreneur Business and Development and Extension Services offices to which the implementation of these projects are anchored with, thus communication and internet expenses charged to the projects should have been lessened as a result of the investment made by the University.



11.8	Considering the available packages, the Management may evaluate its reasonableness and propriety which can practically reduce expenses on cell cards.  Also, the plan requires the user to pay for a specific fixed amount and there are calling plans which allow the user to leave the network service anytime. 



	1)	 We recommended that Management:



11.9.1	establish clear-cut guidelines on the allowed communication expenses to be claimed by those assigned in special projects considering their degree of participation in the project and the number of projects they are handling; 



		1)	consider adopting the post-paid plans offered by the network providers for economical reasons;



11.9.3	review the possibility of granting reasonable value of cell cards to all NVSU administrative personnel and others whose functions require close coordination and communication to other offices or its clientele which may be proportionately charged to administrative costs of the projects, if warranted;



11.9.4	Recipients must affix their name and signature in acknowledging the cell cards they received for us to properly assess the validity of expenses; and



		1)	Adhere strictly with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



12)	Additional cash advance was granted to the Disbursing Officer without first settling/liquidating her previous cash advances totaling P1,470,213.64 and cash advances in the amount of P5,124,800.00 remained unsettled for more than months due to lack of monitoring and non-compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, thereby exposing government funds to risk of loss through theft or misappropriation.



12.1	COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides, among others, the following rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances:



“4.1 No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



 xxx



5.7 When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer.



5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for Petty Cash Fund, the accountable officer shall refund any unexpended balance to the cashier/collecting officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.”



12.2	During the audit of the accounts of the Disbursing Officer of Bambang Campus, it was found that she was granted additional cash advances even if her previous cash advances, as listed below, were not yet liquidated.

12.3	The grant of additional cash advance to a Disbursing Officer without first settling/liquidating the previous cash advances exposes government funds to risk of loss.



12.4	Additionally, it was noted that the cash advances granted to the Disbursing Officer were not regularly monitored. Audit found that seven (7) of her cash advances amounting to P5,124,800.00 remained unsettled as of cash date of which total disbursements amounting to P4,635,700.00, leaving undisbursed amount of P489,100.00.  As illustrated in ANNEX “L”, the amount P489,100.00 from the abovementioned cash advances of the disbursing officer remained unsettled for up to 216 days.  Failure of the Disbursing officer to liquidate her cash advance within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause of for the withholding of his salary and the institution of other sanction as provided under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 of COA Circular 97-002.  The unexpended cash advances, which were not immediately refunded, were exposed to theft, misappropriation and misuse.  Furthermore, since these were still in the hands of the Disbursing Officer, the University was deprived of any interest or benefit earned had these been redeposited to the authorized bank of the University.



12.5	We recommended that Management:



12.5.1	strictly comply with COA Circular No. 97-002 on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances;



12.5.2	stop granting additional cash advances to those with existing unliquidated cash advances; and



12.5.3	require the immediate liquidation/settlement of those cash advances which remained outstanding for more than two months and submit proof of refund or liquidation/settlement to this office.



13)	Documentary requirements for Petty Cash Fund disbursements were not strictly followed and non-maintenance of accounting books, records, forms and reports, contrary to guidelines set forth in Chapter 6 of the GAM Volume I for NGAs, indicating weak internal control and exposing government fund to possible risk of loss and misuse.



13.1	Documentary requirements for PCF were not strictly followed. Section 36, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) states that:



“The documentary requirements for PCF as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14,2012 amended by COA Circular No. 2013-001 dated January 10, 2013 and under this Chapter, are as follows:

       xxx



1)	Report on paid petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCV) (Appendix 49);

2)	Approved purchase request with certificate of Emergency Purchase if  necessary;

3)	Bill, receipts, sales invoices;

4)	Inspection and acceptance report (IAR) (Appendix 62);

5)	Waste Material Report (WMR) (Appendix 65) in case of replacement/ repair;

6)	Approved trip ticket, for gasoline/ fuel expenses

7)	Canvass from at least 3 suppliers for purchases involving P1,000.00 and above, except for purchases made while on travel.

8)	Summary/ Abstract of Canvass

9)	PCVs duly accomplished and signed;

10)	OR in case of refund

11)	For reimbursement of toll receipts

i)	Toll receipts

ii)	Trip tickets

12)	Such other supporting documents that may be required.”



13.2	The Audit Team had observed that most of the attached documents supporting the disbursements of Petty Cash Fund were not properly accomplished denoting weak internal control.  Among the documents are the following:



13.2.1	Purchase Requests (PR) were not prepared covering numerous Petty Cash disbursements.  PR should be accomplished for each purchase made.



13.2.2	Each purchase was not accompanied with Inspection and Acceptance Reports.



13.2.3	Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs) were prepared covering various purchases at different dates, instead of one PCV for each purchase made. PCVs were not pre-numbered.



13.2.4	No canvass was made for purchases amounting to P1,000 and above.



13.2.5	These documents can be simply accomplished with simple procedures. They function as precautionary measures to ensure proper utilization of government funds and improve transparency and accountability on government transactions.



13.2.6	Non maintenance of accounting records, forms and reports.



13.3 Section 37 of Government Accounting Manual, Volume I states that:



“Petty Cash Custodian shall prepare the Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCV) and maintain the Petty Cash Fund Record (PCFR) (Appendix 50) to monitor and control the granting and utilization of the fund.  The RPPV shall be the basis in the preparation of the Disbursement Voucher to replenish the PCF.”



13.4	The audit disclosed that the Petty Cash Custodian did not prepare and maintain PCF records, and reports were not accomplished such as Petty Cash Fund Report and Report on Paid PCVs on every disbursement made from the fund. A duly approved PCV ensures that funds were granted with the knowledge and approval of the PCFC and were expended for valid purposes. Payment of petty expenses despite the absence of approved PCVs therefore, carried the risk that disbursements were processed without authority. Consequently, no system of numbering was adopted for disbursements which are also necessary for reference and control purposes.

	

13.5	The aforementioned circumstances are indications that the University failed to institute adequate internal control on handling of petty cash, thus exposed the government funds to unnecessary risk of loss and unauthorized use. 

	

13.6	We recommended that the PCF Custodian ensures that Petty Cash Vouchers submitted for processing have complete documentations.  We also recommended that the concerned Accounting personnel and the Cashier must not process petty cash transactions unless the pertinent supporting documents are completely accomplished to ensure that only regular, legal, necessary and authorized transactions are being paid out of government funds.

	 

13.7	Moreover, we recommended that the PCFC prepare and maintain the required reports, forms and records prescribed in Section 37 of Chapter 6 of the GAM Volume 1.



	Gender and Development



14)	The Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) in the GAD Plans and Budgets (GPB) may not properly identify and address gender-related issues existing in the University due to the failure to fully implement the GAD related activities in their GAD Plans and Budget which was not adjusted/revised to address gender issues and concerns related to the effects of the Pandemic caused by COVID 19, and absence of readily available registry/record to monitor the utilization of the fund.



14.1	Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01 or Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta of Women stated that all government departments including State Universities and Colleges shall formulate their GAD Plan and Budgets (GPBs) within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects, and that  GAD Planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies.



14.2	In prescribing gender mainstreaming as a strategy for implementing Section 36 (c) of RA No. 9710, or the Magna Carta for Women (MCW) which mandates that all government agencies shall develop and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated, and subjected to gender analysis for planning, programming, and policy formulation.



14.3	Despite the guidelines set forth under PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and RA 9170, the University submitted to the Office of the Auditor a GPB for 2020 which contains the details that are similar with the GPB submitted for 2019. Our audit of the GPB showed unimplemented and discontinued PPAs similar to the prior year. Consequently, the allocated amount to implement planned PPAs was not utilized as of year-end as per the GAD Accomplishment Report.



14.4	Moreover, given the effect of the Pandemic on the implementation of PPAs, the PCW issued Memorandum Circular 2020-03 dated 27 April 2020 providing guidelines on the Adjustment and/or Implementation of the FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget in view of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation. The University Focal Person did not consider this Memorandum Circular and made no revisions to the original GPB that was formulated before the Pandemic which involved PPAs that are impossible to implement due to health safety measures and/or quarantine that limit the movement of stakeholders. Thus, depriving intended beneficiaries of the PAPs the benefits therefrom.



14.5	We recommended that Management instruct the GAD Focal Person to properly establish and maintain a GAD database in compliance with the above mentioned guidelines in order to ascertain the alignment of the GAD Plan and Budget with PAPs which are realistic and doable within the year.



15)	Only P215,000.00 was utilized for GAD due to partial or non-implementation of the Programs, Activities, and Projects (PAPs) in the GAD Plan and Budget, thus, depriving the intended beneficiaries of the PAPs the benefits therefrom, contrary to Section 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465.



15.1	Section 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and Section 31 of the general provisions of RA No. 11465, the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020, provides that: 



	15.2	Section 6.1, PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01:

	 

	“At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs.  The GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), Capital Outlay (CO), and Personal Services (PS).  It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.”

	

	15.3	Section 31, GAA FY 2020:

	

	“All agencies of the government shall formulate a [GAD] Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).

	 

	 The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by the agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human rights and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.

	

	The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies concerned.”



15.4	The University submitted to the Office of the Auditor the University’s annual GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) which does not include some of the identified GAD Activity found in the annual GAD Plan. A review of the GAD AR further revealed that the actual cost/expenditure was only P215,000.00, not even at 1% of the total budget.



15.5	The underutilization of the GAD Fund is an indication that the University is not committed to support the objectives of the government in incorporating GAD in the regular activities of the agencies pursuant to the abovementioned provisions.



15.6	In depth analysis of the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 of the University shows that, among others, the total budget appropriation for gender and development was not at least five percent (5%) of CY 2020’s total budget based on the General Appropriations Act. Thus the GPB for CY 2020 is under budget. The GPB indicated as basis a total GAA of P375,000,000.00 which should be P477,907,000.00. Therefore, the budget which should be at 5% of the total GAA is P23,895,350.00.



15.7	It was also noted that out of the proposed GAD activities, only three activities were considered partially implemented, to wit:



GAD ACTIVITY

APPROVED BUDGET

ACTUAL EXPENDITURE

REMARKS

Conduct of GAD responsive extension services in coordination with the colleges such as Munting Paaralan: Habang-buhay na Kaalaman, Skills Trainings, Tulong Pangkabuhayan Program

Continuous attendance/participation of GAD Focal System members to GAD related seminars, trainings and workshop summits

300,000.00



Budget was not utilized because most of the seminars was conducted online



15.8	Another possible reason for failure to utilize GAD Budget on PPAs responsive to identified priority gender issues and concerns is the change in the GAD Focal Person on the utilization of fund, non-coordination with the Budget Officers and Planning Department. It should be noted that the University fails to take GAD reports seriously for the past years. Hopefully with the change in GAD Focal Person, there can be better accounting and reporting for the ensuing years.



15.9	We recommended that Management support activities that promote gender awareness and sensitivity, in realization of the objectives of the Magna Carta for Women, and instruct the GAD Focal Person to:



15.9.1	be kept informed of the latest issuances pertaining to the implementation of GAD;



15.9.2	establish and maintain a GAD database; and



15.9.3	exert efforts in implementing or accomplishing the GAD activities indicated in the GPB.



Remittance of GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth Premium Contribution



16)	The University has complied with the rules on the proper deductions of GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth premiums from the salaries of employees and the timely remittance of these premiums to the GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, in accordance with Republic Act Nos. 8291, 9679, and 7875, respectively.



Compliance With Tax laws  

  

17)	The University has complied with tax laws and appropriately withheld taxes from the payment of goods, services and contracts, in accordance with tax laws.
