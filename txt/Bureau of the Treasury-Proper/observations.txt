OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

 
Accounting errors  

 

1. Various accounting errors in the keeping of the accounts had resulted in the 
misstatements in some assets, liabilities and equity accounts. 

 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1, Paragraph 27 

provides that Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the 

faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in the IPSAS.  IPSAS No. 1, Paragraph 29 b, also states that a 

fair presentation also requires an entity to present information, including accounting 

policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable, and understandable 

information.   

 

Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires the agency, among 

others, to keep its accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 

and to observe the highest standards of honesty, objectivity, and consistency in the 

keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

Analysis of the accounts and the related Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and 

supporting documents revealed accounting errors arising from erroneous accounting 

entries, and computation/measurement affecting various accounts, as shown in Table 

1.

i. CO Other Payables 1,875,901.56 COA Circular No. 
2015-007  Accumulate Surplus/(Deficit) (1,875,901.56) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require the concerned 

personnel of the Bureau Accounting Division (BAD) and Accountants of 

Regional Offices (ROs) to prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to 

correct the aforementioned errors; and (b) henceforth, observe the 

proper/correct recognition of accounts and transactions in accordance with the 

GAM for NGAs and other applicable rules and regulations. 

 

a. Erroneous recognition of transactions under Training Expenses - P17,064.00 
 

In RO XI, disbursements for meals during meetings and conferences, as 

well as the payment for a token to a retiree totalling P17,064.00 were recognized 

under Training Expenses and not under Representation Expenses.  However, the 

Bureau was not provided with a budget for representation expenses. Therefore, 

the officials concerned could have charged the said expenses against their 

Representation Allowance intended for the performance of their official 

functions. As a result, the balance of the Training Expenses was overstated by 

P17,064.00. 

  

We recommended that Management: (a) direct the Accountant to 

recognize expenses related to official meetings/conferences and other official 

functions under Representation Expenses and use Training Expenses for 

training-related activities as described in the RCA; and (b) facilitate the 

request for a budget for official meetings/conferences and other official 



52 

 

functions; otherwise, charge such expenses against the representation 

allowances of the officials. 

 

 

b. Non-setting up of payables - P1.876 million 
 

As at December 31, 2020, Other Payables has a balance of P5.762 

million. However, examination of SL balances of the account in the BTr Central 

Office (CO) revealed that there were five subsidiary ledgers (SLs) with negative 

balances, as shown in the Table 2.

Total       P1,869,111.16  P6,790.40 P1,875,901.56 

 

Analysis of the transactions recognized in the subject SLs showed the 

following: 

 

a) The negative balance of P1.100 million in the SL-Employees Loan 
Amortization/Contribution is mostly attributable to remittance made to the 

National Treasury Multi-Purpose Cooperative (NATCOCU) for the amount 

deducted from the salaries and allowances of the Bureau’s employees (regular 

and Without Leave payroll) without setting up the corresponding payable for 

the deductions made on the salaries and allowances in the regular payroll. 

 

b) The negative balance of P34,244.13 in the SL-Employees Loan Amortization 
is due to the recognition of the remittance to the NATCOCU without setting 

up the corresponding payable. 

 

c) Under SL- BTr Employees - Retired/Separated (2019), the payment of 
Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentive (CNAI) for CY 2018 of 

P12,500.00 was recognized without setting up the corresponding payable. 

Also, there was a difference of P0.01 between the amount set up as payable 

for Subsistence and Laundry Allowance of P1,454.36 and the payment of 

P1,454.35. 

 

d) For SL- Employees Loan Amortization, the negative balance of P0.726 
million was due to the recognition of the remittance of P0.726 million to the 



53 

 

BTr Provident Fund for loan amortizations without setting up the 

corresponding payable.  

 

e) The negative balance of P3,725.43 in the SL-Dormant Accounts pertains to 
the difference between the total SL balance and General Ledger (GL) balance 

of Other Payables during the transition from the manual National 

Government Accounting System to the electronic National Government 

Accounting System (eNGAS) in CY 2014. This SL had remained dormant 

since CY 2014. 

 

Due to the negative SL balances, the year-end balances of Other 

Payables and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) were understated and overstated by 

P1.876 million, respectively.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, 

BAD to ensure that payables, where necessary, are set-up prior to 

recognizing payments for transactions to preclude the existence of negative 

SL balances. 

 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. The completeness, accuracy, and existence of several assets and liabilities could 
not be readily ascertained due to variances between books and related records, 

non-compliance with accounting standards (GAM for NGAs) and other relevant 

issuances, and dormancy of some accounts, among others. 

 

Analysis of the accounts revealed accounting deficiencies arising from 

misclassification, unreconciled balances and/or not properly documented 

transactions affecting the accounts, as shown in Table 3.

  The lack of necessary documents to support the disbursements made in 

the CO and the concerned ROs precluded the determination of the accuracy of 

the balances of the affected accounts, as well as the regularity and validity of the 

transactions recognized in the books. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

officials of the BTr CO and ROs NCR, III, IV-A, VI and XIII to submit 

immediately all the lacking documents to establish the accuracy, regularity 

and validity of the payments made.  

 

We also recommended that Management require the Chief, BAD and 

the Accountants of the ROs to process payments/claims only when supported 

with the minimum documentary requirements for all types of disbursements 

prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

   
b. SL balances under Other Payables outstanding for two to six years- P5.492 

million 

 

As at December 31, 2020, Other Payables had a balance of P5.762 

million. Analysis of the account disclosed that it is composed of, among others, 

personnel benefits of retired/separated/deceased BTr employees, employees’ 

contributions/ loan amortizations, wages of Job Order (JO) personnel, wages and 

overtime pay of janitorial personnel. The SLs under the account had balances 

totaling P5.492 million or 95.32 per cent of the balance, which have been 

outstanding for two to six years as shown in Table 5.

 Total P5,492,307.38 

 

In spite of the length of time the payables have been outstanding in the 

books, the same were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the 

General Fund of the NG.   

 



57 

 

The existence of long-outstanding account balances in the books affected 

the accuracy of the account balances of Other Payables and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit), undermining the fair presentation of the financial statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, BAD, 

to revert the long outstanding SL balances under Other Payables to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund of the National 

Government.    
 

c. Discrepancies between the balances per books and per RPCPPE 
 

Comparison of the PPE account balances per books against the RPCPPE 

as at December 31, 2020, in the BTr CO and RO XIII, disclosed a discrepancy of 

P365,281.24 which can be attributed, among others, to the following:

computer sets.

the books but not reported in 

the RPCPPE 

550,495.97 ICT equipment already transferred in the 

ROs but were not yet derecognized in the

With the discrepancies between the balances per books and per RPCPPE, 

the completeness and accuracy of the balances of Information and 



58 

 

Communication Technology Equipment and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) were 

not determined.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, 

BAD/Accountant to coordinate with the Chairperson, Inventory 

Committee/Property Officer, for the reconciliation of the accounting records 

and the RPCPPE and to make the necessary adjustments in the books. 

 

d. Undisposed unserviceable PPE - P3.087 million 
 

Review of the PPE accounts disclosed that the unserviceable properties 

of the ROs IV-B, V, and IX totalling P3.087 million remained undisposed 

because requests for disposals were not yet approved. Moreover, disposal through 

donation in RO IX were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

In addition, the PPE listed in the IIRUP of RO IX lacked details such as 

cost of the PPE, acquisition date, quantity, and property number. 

 

The non-disposal of the unserviceable PPE exposed the said PPE items to 

further deterioration, and decline in value, and consequently, deprived the 

government of the benefits of the most appropriate and advantageous mode of 

disposal. The absence of property number, costs and quantity, among others, may 

result in erroneous derecognition of PPEs and computation of income/loss, if any. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Chairperson, Disposal Committee of ROs IV-B, V and IX to expedite the 

disposal of the reported unserviceable properties to prevent further 

deterioration. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Supply Officer in RO IX to prepare the IIRUP with complete details of the 

properties. 

 

e. Unreconciled discrepancies in the books, FARs and FSs. 
 

Review of FARs and comparison with the related FSs revealed the 

following: 

 

e.1 Unreconciled balances of disbursements in the FSs 

 

Although the BTr NCR did not have its own budget appropriation in the 

General Appropriations Act (GAA) and receives its budget from the BTr CO by 

way of sub-allotments and Notices of Transfer of Allocation, the sub-allotted 

budget was presented under “Budgeted Amounts-Original and Final” columns 

instead of  under the “Final Amounts” column of the Statement of Comparison 

of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA).  



59 

 

Review of the submitted FSs also revealed that the balances presented in 

the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) and SCBAA did not tally as presented in 

Table 7. 

 

Table 7- Discrepancies between the SCF and SCBAA 

Particulars 
Balance 

Per SCF Per SCBAA Discrepancies 

Personnel Services (PS) P20,700,900.90  P20,627,132.94  P73,767.96

Total P23,798,271.14  P23,698,483.86  P99,787.28  

 

The differences between the totals for PS and MOOE in the cash outflows 

of the SCF and SCBAA were due to erroneous classification of PS accounts as 

MOOE and vice versa, exclusion of paid tax refund to retired employees and 

remitted Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) contribution in the 

SCBAA.  In addition, the differences between the final budget and actual amount 

in the SCBAA were not also disclosed in the Notes to FSs. 

 

The noted discrepancies between the PS and MOOE in the SCF and 

SCBAA, due to human error, rendered the FSs unreliable. Also, the non-

disclosure in the Notes to the Financial Statements of the differences between the 

final budget and actual amounts in the SCBAA did not provide readers of the FS 

adequate information on the said differences. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting 

Accountant to (i) analyze and verify discrepancies in the FSs, make the 

necessary adjustments in the related books of accounts and FSs; and (ii) 

include in the Notes to FSs an explanation on the material differences 

between the budget and actual amounts.  

 

e.2 Discrepancies in obligations between FAR No. 3 and Statement of Financial 

Position (SFP)  

Review of payable transactions in the BTr NCR revealed that the 

obligations presented in the Aging of Due and Demandable Obligations 

(ADDO)–FAR No. 3 had a discrepancy totaling P196,847.72 against the total 

liabilities in the SFP. According to the Acting Accountant, the total obligations 

in the ADDO–FAR No. 3 included obligations of P5,904.50 incurred in CY 2020 

and excluded those beyond 366 days. 

 

Moreover, the submitted format of ADDO–FAR No. 3 did not include the 

columns for aging of obligations for more than 1 year but less than 2 years and 

more than 2 years.   

 



60 

 

The discrepancies and incomplete information in ADDO-FAR No. 3 

affected the accuracy and completeness of the said FAR.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting 

Accountant to: (a) revise the ADDO–FAR No. 3 accordingly to reconcile with 

the balance presented in the SFP; (b) ensure that the current and prior 

years’ obligations are included in the FAR No. 3; and (c) to prepare the 

ADDO-FAR No. 3 in accordance with the prescribed template under COA-

DBM JC No. 2019-01. 

 

e.3 Discrepancies between the Check Disbursement Journal (CkDJ) and 

Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements, and 

Balances by Object of Expenditure (SAAODBOE)-FAR No. 1-A - P62,986.44 

   

In the BTr NCR, review of the books of accounts and FARs revealed that 

there were discrepancies totaling P62,986.44 between the CkDJ and 

SAAOBDOE-FAR No. 1-A which were due to double posting of unpaid salaries, 

and  unposted adjustments under Salaries and Wages and Philhealth 

Contributions in the CkDJ amounting to P5,904.58 and P3,657.48, respectively. 

 

Moreover, Office Supplies Expenses had a net difference of P72,548.50 

between CkDJ and FAR No. 1-A due to  the inclusion of  the balance of Semi-

Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Books Expenses of P86,184.00 and 

erroneous recognition of issued office supplies of P13,635.50 under Other 

Maintenance and Operating Expenses, both in SAAODBOE-FAR No. 1-A. 

 

These discrepancies were due to human error since BTr NCR is maintaining 

manuals books of accounts and only has one personnel in the Accounting Section 

who performs all the functions of the said section, thus, affecting the 

completeness and accuracy of the balances of the affected accounts and FARs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting 

Accountant to: (i) analyze the transactions affected by the discrepancies and 

make the necessary adjustments to correct the balances presented in the 

CkDJ and (ii) revise the disbursements portion of  the SAAODB (FAR NO. 

1 and FAR No. 1-A) accordingly to correct the  misclassifications of 

transactions under Office Supplies Expenses, Semi-Expendable Furniture, 

Fixtures and Books Expenses and Other Maintenance and Operating 

Expenses; and (iii) observe  due care in the reporting  of transactions in the 

related FARs. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to consider the use of 

the eNGAS and eBudget to facilitate the maintenance of the books of 

accounts, generation of financial reports and statements, and budgetary 

reports. 

 



61 

 

f. Unreported disbursements in the RCDisb  
  

Review of the liquidated cash advances in the RO XI revealed that there 

were cash advances for the Year-End Assessment and Thanksgiving Day 

celebration of P225,000.00 and P54,000.00, respectively. Of total cash advance 

of P279,000.00, P21,816.00 was reported in the RCDisb.  However, the total 

amount of the cash advance was already liquidated under JEV No. 2020-12-196 

dated December 31, 2020. The difference of P257,184.00 was not reported in the 

RCDisb. 

 

Moreover, it was observed that the RCDisb used by the RO XI did not 

conform with the prescribed format in the GAM for NGAs as the report lacks 

details such as period covered, fund cluster, responsibility center code and UACS 

object code. 

 

The non-reporting of all the disbursements from the cash advances in the 

RCDisb did not provide the details and nature of all payments made out of the 

cash advances. Non-compliance with the required format of the RCDisb did not 

provide the necessary information for the Accountant to effectively monitor the 

cash advances and to ensure the correct recognition of the corresponding 

liquidations in the books of the accounts. 

 

We recommended and Management of the RO XI agreed to direct the 

Disbursing Officer to: (i) report all disbursements in the RCDisb; and (ii) 

adopt and use the prescribed format of the RCDisb and ensure that all the 

required details are presented. 

 

g. Outright recognition of inventories as expenses – P0.576 million 

 

Analysis of the Statement of Financial Performance of the RO XII for the 

period ending December 31, 2020 disclosed that the RO procured office supplies 

of P0.576 million from various suppliers.  The said purchases were not recognized 

as inventory but as outright expenses. Also, the Accounting Unit and 

Supply/Property Unit do not maintain the prescribed Supplies Ledger Cards 

(SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs), respectively. 

 

Accordingly, the outright recognition of inventory items as outright 

expenses did not reflect the actual status of inventory items as inventories still on 

hand and still available for use were already recognized as expenses affecting the 

accuracy of the balances of Office Supplies Inventory and Office Supplies 

Expenses. With the absence of the SLCs and SCs, there were no inventory records 

that supports the balances of inventories in the books and that would show 

whether all issued supplies and materials were already or yet to be consumed, 

among others. 

 



62 

 

We recommended and Management of the RO XII agreed to require: 

(a) the Accountant to: (i) prepare and maintain SLCs for each item of 

inventory; and (ii) show the amount of inventory on hand at all times based 

on the maintained SLCs; and (b) the Supply Officer to prepare and maintain 

SCs for each item in stock. 

 

h. Unreconciled balances of inventories -  P146,649.09 
 

In the RO XIII, comparison between balances per books of Office Supplies 

Inventory against the Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI), SLCs and 

SCs disclosed a discrepancy of P146,649.09. Review of pertinent documents 

showed that the discrepancy can be attributed, among others, to the following: 

 

 h.1 Discrepancies between the book and SLC balances 
    

A discrepancy of P95,364.89 between the GL balance and the aggregate of 

the SLC balances was noted since most of the inventory items reflected in the 

latter have zero balances. The zero balances were due to non-updating of the 

SLCs to reflect the actual balances of the inventory items. In addition, the SLCs 

were maintained by the Supply Officer and not by the Accountant as the latter 

was not aware that it was part of his responsibilities. 

 

 

 h.2 Discrepancy between the RPCI and aggregate balance of the inventory items 

in the SC 
 

The SCs for office supplies have zero balances as against the actual count 

reflected in the RPCI totaling P51,284.20. Further, the submitted RPCI has no 

indicated balance per card which should be based on the SCs, thus, defeating the 

purpose of comparing the balance per SC and per actual count conducted.  

 

The Supply Officer explained that the “Balance Per Card” column in the 

RPCI was not filled-up since there was already an issuance of the Report of 

Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) on December 31, 2020 and that, actual 

balance was reflected under the “On Hand Per Count” since the issued supplies 

were not yet consumed by the requesting party. The said process was done to 

ensure that the Supply Officer has still the control of the issued supplies.  

 

However,  the RSMI for the P51,284.20 office supplies on hand balance had 

been prepared by the Supply Officer and even without the duly received Request 

and Issuance Slips (RISs) by the requisitioning personnel and reflected the items 

as issued in the SCs, thus, causing the variances with the RPCI. 

 

As a result of the above-mentioned lapses, the existence and accuracy of the 

balance of Office Supplies Inventory could not be established. 

 



63 

 

We recommended and Management of the RO XIII agreed to require 

the Accountant and the Supply Officer to reconcile the discrepancies 

between their records and update the respective SLCs and SCs to reflect the 

actual inventory balance per physical count reported in the RPCI. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Supply 

Officer to (a) submit all the original copies of the RIS duly received by the 

requisitioning personnel for issuances of office supplies for CY 2020 to the 

Accounting Division to support the previously submitted RSMIs;(b) prepare 

the RSMI based on the duly accomplished RISs and submit both to the 

Accounting Division for recognition of issuances of office supplies; and (c) 

accomplish completely the RPCI for the physical count of inventories. 

 

i. Dormant accounts - P1.153 million  
 

In the BTr CO, the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges showed that 

balances for SL-Dormant accounts and SL-R. Gimeno have been dormant for 16 

and 26 years, respectively. 

 

The balance of the SL-Dormant accounts of P0.748 million pertains to the 

difference between the GL and SLs of the account during the roll out of the 

eNGAS in CY 2004, which had been carried forward to CY 2020 or for about 16 

years. 

 

The P404,285.85 balance of SL-R. Gimeno, a deceased employee, consists 

of disallowed representation and transportation allowance and salaries totaling 

P44,882.85 and P359,403.00, respectively. These were recognized in the books 

on March 18, 1994 and May 26, 1994, respectively, or  26 years ago.  In June 

2006, the Bureau requested the account’s write-off but the COA returned the said 

request due to the lack of supporting documents. 

 

The dormant accounts affected the existence and accuracy of the balance of 

Receivables-Disallowances/Charges as at year-end. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant 

to: (a) ensure the immediate settlement of disallowances and charges; and 

(b) clearance from money accountabilities of retiring/transferring employees 

are not signed unless their disallowances and/or charges are fully settled.  
 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

Delayed/non-submission of financial reports and/or documents 

 

3. Delayed/non-submission of reports and/or documents such as Disbursement 
Vouchers (DVs), trial balances (TBs), FSs, JEVs, Bank Reconciliation 

Statements (BRSs) and BFARs precluded the timely verification of financial 



64 

 

accounts and transactions, and the early communication of audit results to 

Management for corrective action, among others. 

 

One of the standards to achieve fair presentation and reliable information of 

the FSs is timeliness in the preparation and submission of reports. All needed reports 

should be provided promptly to be of maximum usefulness. 

 

COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 on the Rules and 

Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) requires the Chief Accountant, 

bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping 

functions of the audited agency to ensure, among others, that the reports and 

supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately 

recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first 10 

days of the ensuing month. The Auditor, on the other hand, shall enforce the 

submission of the receipt and disbursement records with all paid vouchers, ORs and 

supporting documents as prescribed by the Commission and the related laws, rules 

and regulations, and as necessary in the course of audit. 

 

 Further, COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-01 dated January 1, 2019 

provides the guidelines for the preparation of FARs which should be submitted to the 

DBM, COA Auditor and COA-Government Accountancy Sector.

    In the BTr NCR, the Acting Cashier disclosed that the Lists of Due and 

Demandable Accounts Payable – Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADAs) were 

forwarded to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to initiate fund transfer to 

different payees of the BTr NCR. The LBP received these LDDAP-ADAs by 

stamping the time and date of receipt.  The Acting Cashier maintains a file of the 

received copies of the LDDAP-ADAs. However, the validated copies of the LDDAP-

ADA were not requested from the LBP. The validated LDDAP-ADA is to support 

disbursements or charges to the Notice of Cash Allocations of the Bureau.  

 

Moreover, review of the Individual Performance Commitment and Review 

(IPCR) of the Acting Accountant in the BTr NCR revealed that the deadline for the 

submission of the reports to the Audit Team stipulated in the GAM was not indicated 

in the “Success Indicator” column. Therefore, the IPCR did not consider the 

timeliness in the submission of the above reports which should have an effect in the 

rating to be given to the Acting Accountant. 

 

The delayed/non-submission of the reports and documents were due to the 

skeletal working arrangement, which resulted in delays in the signing of supporting 

documents/reports to be attached to the reports. The Audit Teams fully understood 

the situation, thus, considerable grace period was given in the submission of the 

required reports. However, some of the necessary reports and supporting documents 

enumerated in Table 8 had not been submitted to the Audit Teams.  

 

As such, the delayed/non-submission of financial reports, JEVs and 

supporting documents did not enable the timely review by the Audit Teams of the 

financial operations, the performance of the appropriate audit procedures necessary 

under the circumstances and the timely communication of audit results to 

Management. 

 

  We recommended and Management agreed to require: (a) the Chief, 

BAD, Accountants of ROs II and III, and Acting Accountant of NCR to: (i) 

improve on the submission of the required financial reports, JEVs and 

supporting documents to reduce the delays in their submission to the Audit 

Team; and (ii) submit the JEVs with the monthly TB/FSs to facilitate the 

verification of the recognized transactions in the books.  

 

  We also recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Acting 

Accountant, NCR to include as performance indicator in the IPCR of the 

concerned Accounting personnel the timeliness of the submission of the assigned 

documents/reports. 



67 

 

  We further recommended that Management advise the Acting Cashier 

of  the BTr NCR  to obtain the validated copies of LDDAP-ADA from the LBP 

to support the disbursements from the Notices of Cash Allocations. 
 

 

Insufficient/Unsupported and unauthorized disbursements  

  

4. Disbursements totaling P7.562 million for various activities implemented and 
payments of grocery allowance and annual physical and medical examination in 

the amounts of P5.360 million and P265,200.00, respectively, made despite the 

lack of proper authorization and adequate supporting documents to support the 

claims unnecessarily increased the Bureau’s expenses and had not enabled the 

determination of the validity of the expenses incurred. 
 

 Item II of COA Circular No. 2013-03 dated January 30, 2013 states that 

government officials and employees shall be entitled only to allowances, incentives 

and other benefits expressly provided by law, and other statutory authority. 

 

In addition, Section 2 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 37 dated November 

21, 1998 provides that heads of NGAs, Local Government Units (LGUs) including 

Government Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Government Financial 

Institutions as well as their respective governing boards are hereby enjoined and 

prohibited from authorizing/granting Amelioration Assistance or any other similar 

benefit without prior approval and authorization via AO by the Office of the 

President. 

 

Moreover, Section 4, Item pp of Republic Act (RA) No. 11494 dated 

September 11, 2020 states “Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, directing the 

discontinuance of appropriated programs, activities or projects (P/A/Ps) of any 

agency of the Executive Department, including GOCCs, in the fiscal years (FYs) 

2019 and 2020 GAA, which cannot be utilized effectively as a result of the COVID-

19 outbreak, whether released or unreleased, the allotments for which remain 

unobligated, and utilize the savings generated therefrom to augment the allocation 

for any item needed to address the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the herein 

declared national policy. The P/A/Ps that may be discontinued shall include 

discretionary foreign travel, representation, mass events and those identified by 

government agencies prior to the effectivity of this Act.” 

 

Further, Section 11 (a) of RA No. 11949 provides that the funds for the 

authorized programs and projects related to COVID-19 recovery shall be sourced 

primarily from the unprogrammed funds and savings realized from modified, 

realigned or reprogrammed allocations for operational expenses of any government 

agency or instrumentalities under the Executive Department, including but not 

limited to travelling expenses, supplies and materials expenses, professional 

expenses, general services and other maintenance and operating expenses in the 2020 

GAA. 



68 

 

Section 4 of PD No. 1445 provides that claims against government funds shall 

be supported with complete documentation. Similarly, COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the documentary requirements for common 

government transactions. Included therein is the provision, among others, that claims 

against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

Examination of the transactions of the Bureau revealed that cash advances 

were granted for the payment of disbursements for various activities and benefits to 

its permanent employees totaling P13.187 million, as follows: 

 

Table 9 – Various year-end activities of the Bureau 

Particulars Total Amount 

Year-end Assessment P 5,216,000.00 

Grocery Allowance 5,360,000.00 

Thanksgiving Day 1,377,000.00 

Online Strategic Planning and Team Building Activity 969,000.00 

Annual Medical and Physical Examination 265,200.00 

Total P13,187,200.00 

 

Review of the cash advances granted for the said activities and benefits 

revealed the following: 

 

a. Insufficient/Unsupported liquidations for Year-End Assessment, Online 
Strategic Planning and Team Building Activity, and Thanksgiving Day – P7.272 

million 

 

The Year-end Assessment was a five-day year-end assessment conference 

between December 8 to 18, 2020. For the conference, the   accomplishments/ 

performance versus targets proposed by the Bureau’s offices/units for CY 2020 

were to be discussed and assessed. Meanwhile, the Online Strategic Planning 

and Virtual Team Building Activity was a five-day activity from November 16 

to 20, 2020 whereas Thanksgiving Day scheduled on December 16-17 and 21, 

2020 was declared to promote the solidarity and employee morale. The 

memoranda for these activities were approved by the Treasurer of the 

Philippines (TOP). 

 

Audit of disbursements in the ROs NCR, II, III, IV-B, VI, IX, and XIII 

revealed that the cash advances for the activities were to  cover the meals, 

venues, and other incidental expenses related to the said activities. However, the 

cash advances for these activities were distributed individually to the regular 

employees, either through payroll or signed acknowledgement receipts, instead 

of utilizing the same for the payments of expenses usually incurred in the 

conduct of training or similar activities. The allotted budget for each regular 

employees, per payroll/acknowledgement receipts, was P10,000.00 for Year-

End Assessment, P1,500.00 for Online Strategic Planning and Virtual Team 

Building and P2,000.00 for Thanksgiving Day. 



69 

 

 

Further, the liquidations made were supported with various ORs for 

groceries and meals purchased during the month of December 2020 along with 

the acknowledgement receipts/payrolls. However, there were liquidations that 

were not supported with related documents. 

 

Moreover, in the CO, the JEVs, LRs and supporting documents relative to 

the grant of  similar cash advances as well as the related liquidation reports for 

these activities were not submitted to the Audit Team and were included  among 

the unsubmitted reports/documents in Table 8.  

 

b. Grant of Annual Medical and Physical Examination – P265,200.00 
 

For CY 2020, the TOP issued a memorandum dated December 17, 2020 

for the 2020 Annual Medical and Physical Examination (AMPE) of all regular 

employees to monitor the health status of the Bureau’s employees by providing 

on-site services like routine diagnostic screening and other ancillary procedure 

to ensure early detection and adequate treatment of illnesses, if any.  

 

While the memorandum stated the provision of on-site services, the grant 

of the AMPE for ROs II, IV-B, VII, IX and XI were made either thru payroll for 

reimbursements of the expenses incurred for medical and diagnostic 

examinations instead of availing the services of a registered Medical and Dental 

Clinic.  

 

c. Grant of grocery allowance without proper authorization – P5.360 million 
 

The memorandum dated December 1, 2020 approved by the TOP granted 

the regular employees of the Bureau a cash subsidy in the form of grocery 

allowance of P10,000.00 to help mitigate the impact of the current global health 

emergency and support the needs of employees and other personnel during the 

COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

In the ROs NCR, II, III, IV-B, VI, XI and XIII, the grant of grocery 

allowance was initially given as cash advance and subsequently distributed to 

employees through payrolls/acknowledgement receipts. Further, some 

liquidations made were supported with ORs for groceries while others were not 

supported with documents. However, the grant of the grocery allowance was 

without prior approval from the Office of the President. 

 

For CO, the JEVs and supporting documents related to the grant and 

liquidation of cash advance for grocery allowance was not submitted and 

included in the Table 8. 

 

Moreover, being part of the Executive Department, the authority to grant 

additional benefits to the employees rests in the hands of the President of the 



70 

 

Philippines. Thus, any additional benefits to be given to the employees must 

have prior approval of the President, however, such approval was not sought 

prior to the grant of the grocery allowance. 

 

d. Disbursements related to discontinued P/A/Ps – P7.562 million 
 

Review of the transactions revealed that the Bureau conducted and 

disbursed payments for Year-End Assessment, Online Strategic Planning and 

Team Building Activity, and Thanksgiving Day despite the provision for 

discontinuance of P/A/Ps which cannot be utilized effectively due to COVID-19 

outbreak in RA No. 11494. The expenses for these activities were recognized 

under Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses for P6.593 million, and 

Training Expenses for P0.969 million. 

  

It was mentioned in RA No. 11949 that certain P/A/Ps related to various 

expenses were to be discontinued, however, the Bureau still conducted these 

activities. Also, the disbursements for these activities were made to the 

employees through payrolls/acknowledgement receipts, instead of availing of 

the services of qualified service/goods providers.  

 

Overall, the disbursements made for the above cited activities and grant of 

additional benefits in spite of the absence of adequate supporting documents for the 

liquidations of the related cash advances and necessary authority from the Office of 

the President had unnecessarily increased the Bureau’s expenses and had not 

provided evidences to determine the validity of the expenses incurred.  

 

We recommended that Management require the:  (a) concerned 

Accountable Officers to submit to the Acting Accountant/Accountants the 

required documents to support the liquidation of their respective cash advances 

for verification; and  

(b) Acting Accountant/Accountants to submit the Liquidation Reports and 

complete supporting documents to the Audit Team.  

 

We also recommended that Management refrain from granting 

additional benefits and/or allowances to its employees without prior approval 

from the Office of the President. 

 

 

Deficiencies in Receivable-Disallowances/Charges 

5. Non-deduction of disallowances resulted in the accumulation of unsettled 
disallowances totaling P1.252 million. 

 

Section 7.1.1 of the 2009 RRSA states that the head of the agency, who is 

primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency 

shall ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the 

prescribed period.  Section 7.1.4 of the 2009 RRSA further states that the head of the 



71 

 

agency shall ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other 

agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable.   

 

As at December 31, 2020, Receivables-Disallowances/Charges has a balance 

of P1.252 million. Analysis of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges disclosed the 

following: 
 

a. Unsettled disallowances by retired/resigned, deceased and transferred to other 
agencies - P94,982.44  

 

As a standard procedure, all employees who are about to retire/resign from 

the service or transfer to other agencies shall be cleared from all money and 

property accountabilities.  Likewise, deceased employees shall be cleared from 

their accountabilities. All properties issued shall be returned or replaced and 

money accountabilities including disallowances/charges shall be paid or deducted 

from the final claim of salaries and wages/terminal leave benefits. 

 

Verification of the employment status of personnel in the Schedule of 

Receivables-Disallowances/Charges with the Human Resources and 

Management Division (HRMD) showed that out of 58 employees indicated 

therein, 37 were retired/resigned from the service since CY 2002, four were 

deceased, three were dropped from the rolls, four transferred to other agencies 

and two with unknown status.  

 

According to the concerned BAD personnel, all liabilities of the retiring 

employees and officials of the Bureau are deducted from the final claims for 

salaries and wages or terminal leave benefits. Clearance from money and property 

accountabilities are secured from the Cash and Custodial Division, Property and 

Supply Management Division,  Management Information Systems Service, and 

the BAD prior to processing of the last salaries and terminal leave benefits.  

 

Further, the HRMD informed that the retiring employees and officials of 

the Bureau are required to execute an undertaking authorizing the BAD to deduct 

from the retirement benefits and terminal pay the disallowances and outstanding 

loan balances from the NATCOCU and other government lending institutions.   

 

However, despite the said processes being implemented by the HRMD and 

BAD, disallowances of retired/resigned/deceased/transferred BTr officials/ 

employees totaling P94,982.44 were not deducted from their last salaries and 

wages or terminal leave benefits.  

 

The non-deduction of disallowances from the last salaries and wages or 

terminal leave benefits of the retired/resigned, deceased and transferred 

employees resulted in the accumulation of unsettled disallowances and difficulty 

to collect the same from the persons liable. 

 



72 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, BAD 

to: (a) send demand letter to the retired/resigned/transferred employees to 

collect the disallowances/charges due to the Bureau and require immediate 

settlement thereof; and (b) ensure that disallowances/charges are deducted 

from the last salaries and wages or terminal leave benefits or fully collected 

in settlement of disallowances and charges  

  

b. Unsettled disallowances of various employees in service - P4,100.00 
 

Eight employees with total disallowances of P4,100.00 are still  in service 

at the Bureau.  However, only one employee had settled in CY 2015 P1,210.00  

of the outstanding disallowances while the  disallowances of the other BTr 

employees have not been settled since CY 2014.    

 

The employees with outstanding disallowances are assigned at the ROs. 

Since the disallowances were recognized in the BTr CO books, the ROs were 

unaware of the disallowances. Also, the preparation of the payroll and the release 

of the salaries and wages to the employees are decentralized.  Thus, the 

disallowances were not deducted from the salaries and wages of those liable for 

the same and had remained outstanding as at December 31, 2020.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, BAD 

to: (a) derecognize in the BTr CO books of accounts the outstanding 

disallowances of  BTr officials/employees assigned in the ROs; and  (b) 

furnish the concerned ROs of the copy of JEV of the derecognition of 

disallowances in the CO to be the basis in recognizing the same in the ROs’ 

respective books of accounts. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to instruct the 

Regional Accountants to recognize in their books of accounts the 

disallowances of the employees assigned to their regions and deduct the same 

from their salaries and wages or to fully collect the same. 

 

 

Deficiencies in property management and reporting 

 

6. Non-maintenance of PPELCs and PCs and non-preparation and issuance of 
PARs did not provide check and balance between the property and accounting 

records/reports and evidences of accountability for issued PPE.  

  

Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs requires the Chief 

Accountant to maintain the PPELCs for each category of PPE. For check and balance, 

the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Cards (PCs) for 

PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The 

balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 



73 

 

Division/Unit and with other property records like Property Acknowledgement 

Receipts (PAR). 

 

In the RO IV-A, review of the property records showed that the PCs and 

PPELCs were not maintained by the Property and Accounting Units, respectively, to 

monitor the receipts/acquisitions of PPE and issuances to end-users. Also, the 

Property Unit did not prepare and issue the corresponding PARs for the issuances of 

PPE as evidences of accountability for issued PPE. The said documents were not 

prepared because the Property/Supply Officer as well as the Acting Accountant were 

not aware that such records should be maintained. 

 

In the RO VII, the PCs were not also maintained by the Property Custodian. 

This was also done by the previous personnel who was designated in the same 

position.   

 

The non-maintenance of the said property records affected the reconciliation 

and validation of the balances of the accounts, thus, the existence and accuracy of the 

affected PPE account balances were not determined.  In the absence of the PARs, the 

accountability for PPE issued could not be established. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting 

Accountant of the RO IV-A to maintain the PPELCs to record 

receipts/acquisitions and issuances of PPE, for proper monitoring and 

reconciliation with the physical count of PPE and balances in the PCs. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the Acting 

Property/Supply Officer in ROs IV-A and VII to prepare and maintain PCs for 

reconciliation with the PPELCs and inventory report. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting 

Property/Supply Officer in RO IV-A to prepare and issue PAR for all PPE 

issued to end-users to define responsibility and accountability over the same. 

 

 

Non-Tagging of properties 

7. Non-tagging of PO Zamboanga City’s properties with property stickers resulted 
in the difficulty in identifying the properties maintained by the Property Section. 

 
 Paragraph 5.7 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 on the Guidelines and 

Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of PPE, Recognition of PPE Items 

Found at Station, and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items, for the One-

Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies provides that for 

easy identification, the property number of PPEs shall be prominently shown in the 

property sticker, in addition to description of the property, model number, serial 

number, acquisition date/cost, person accountable and space for the 

validation/signature of the Inventory Committee. 



74 

 

 

On December 11, 2020, during the physical count/inventory of properties and 

equipment in the Treasury Provincial Office of Zamboanga City of the RO IX 

witnessed by the Audit Team, most of the inspected properties were without property 

tag/sticker.  

 

The RO personnel explained that some property stickers naturally fell off over 

time or when the properties were being repaired. The stickers had not been replaced 

thereafter. The labeling of other properties and equipment was also overlooked.  

 

The non-tagging of the properties did not enable the easy identification of 

properties during physical count and did not facilitate verification against Accounting 

and Property records.  

 

         We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Supply Officer 

to properly tag all properties and equipment for easy identification of the 

agency’s properties and verification against the Accounting and Property 

records. 

 

Deficiencies in Fidelity Bond 

8. Insufficient and delayed renewal of fidelity bond of the Disbursing Officer of  
the RO X had placed the Bureau at risk of possible inadequate indemnification 

in the event of fraud or loss. 

 

Fidelity bond is an insurance of bondable public officer under the Fidelity 

Fund to assure that the Accountable Officer faithfully performs all the duties imposed 

by law upon him and that he faithfully accounts all funds and properties coming into 

his possession, custody or control. Bonding of Accountable Officers serves as a 

protection since the Fidelity Fund shall answer for defalcations, shortages and 

unrelieved accountabilities of the bonded employee who has current and existing 

bond up to the actual loss but not exceeding the amount of bond. 

 

Section 5.1, Treasury Circular (TC) No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 

provides that the amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability (cash, 

property and accountable forms) of the accountable public officer as determined by 

the Head of the Agency. Any increase in the amount of accountability, resulting to 

an increase in the amount of bond shall be subject to increase in premium. In addition, 

the TC also requires that the fidelity bond of an accountable officer shall be renewed 

before the expiration of the bond.  

 

In the RO X, there had been a total of 12 single transactions of P219,932.40 
to P0.549 million from January to June 2020 that were processed beyond the 
Disbursing Officer’s maximum accountability.  Clearly, the maximum accountability 

applied for is not representative of the actual accountabilities of the Disbursing 



75 

 

Officer as brought about by the yearly increase in budgetary requirements primarily 

due to salary increases and rising cost of prices. 

 

Further, comparative analysis of bond confirmation letters for the last five 

years revealed that the RO had committed two instances of delays, 18 and 23 calendar 

days, in the renewal of the fidelity bond under Bond Risk Nos. DIC-18-3354R on 

June 8, 2018 and D1Q-20-0767R on June 30, 2020 for its Disbursing Officer. 

Disbursements made by the Disbursing Officer in those two instances of delayed 

renewal of expired fidelity bonds had exposed the Bureau to the heightened risk of 

not recovering the loss of public funds from the Fidelity Fund. 

 

Ideally, an Accountable Officer has to renew the fidelity bond commensurate 

to accountabilities attached to the designation on or before the expiry date of the 

existing bond as a matter of sound internal control.  Based on the past data as 

summarized, it appears that the Bureau has overlooked the implementation of its own 

core operational process in terms of public bonding.  

 

Non-renewal of fidelity bond on time and renewal at amounts that do not 

cover the actual maximum cash accountability of the Disbursing Officer exposed the 

Bureau to the risk of non-recovery of public funds from the Fidelity Fund, in case of 

loss/misappropriation.  

 

We recommended that the Management of RO X (a) observe 

prompt/timely renewal of fidelity bonds for all its accountable officers; (b) 

review yearly the accountable officer’s maximum accountability and apply for 

the necessary increase/decrease in bond to cover the accountable officers’ 

accountabilities  as necessary. 

 

 

Non-maintenance of Index of Payments 

 

9. Non-maintenance of the Index of Payments resulted in the non-monitoring of 
payments made to employees and other creditors and the risk of multiple 

payments of claims.  

 

Appendix 38, Volume II of GAM for NGAs requires the Accounting 

Division/Unit to use an Index of Payment to record/monitor payments made to each 

creditor/payee.  

 

The Acting Regional Accountant of RO IV-A did not maintain the Index of 

Payments for each creditor/payee due to non-awareness of the requirement for its 

maintenance. Former accountants did not also maintain the Index of Payment.  

 

Thus, payments for salaries, allowances and other personnel benefits as well 

as expenses for MOOE such as travelling expenses, training expenses, supplies and 

materials, utilities and other operating expenses totaling P16.847 million and P6.483 



76 

 

million, respectively, were not posted in the Index of Payment resulting to non-

monitoring of payments made to employees and other creditors and the risk of 

multiple payments of claims. 

        

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Director, RO 

IV-A to direct the Acting Accountant to maintain the Index of Payments to 

record/post and monitor all payments made to employees, suppliers, and other 

RO creditors to reduce the risks of multiple payments of claims.  
 

 

Deficiencies in procurement implementation 

 

10. Incomplete information in the Purchase Orders (POs) and preparation of 
Request for Quotation (RFQ) prior to the submission of Purchase Request (PR) 

defeated the purpose for which the documents were officially designed for. 
 

Appendix 61, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs provides the form, description 

and instructions on filling up of POs which include the place and date of delivery, 

delivery terms and payment terms, among others. 

 
Moreover, Section V, Annex H of the Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations of RA No. 9184 provides specific guidelines on Shopping wherein (i) 

the end-user unit or the duly authorized official or personnel shall submit a PR to the 

Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) indicating the urgency to address an identified 

need of the Procuring Entity and the unforeseen contingency that caused its necessity; 

and (ii) the BAC shall immediately prepare the RFQ, indicating the specifications, 

quantity, Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC), and other terms and conditions 

of the contract. 

 

Review of the supporting documents for the procurement activities of the RO 

I for CY 2020 revealed that there were necessary information not provided in the PO, 

such as those presented in the Table 10.

The information such as the place and date of delivery, and delivery and 

payment terms were not presented in the 12 samples of POs totalling P147,305.79. 

These information are essential to provide the suppliers/contractors information on 

the terms of the PO which were to be complied with, to assess the suppliers’ 

compliance with the terms and conditions of the POs, and in ensuring that liquidated 

damages are imposed in case of delayed deliveries. As a result, enforceability of the 

PO was at risk. 

 

Moreover, it was observed that out of these 12 samples, five transactions were 

with RFQs prepared prior to the PRs, as shown in Table 11:

The preparation of the RFQ prior to the receipt of PRs might render the 

procurement process inefficient because the specifications presented in the RFQ may 

not be in agreement with those to be requested by the concerned offices/units and 

reflected in the PR. 

 

We recommended and Management of RO I agreed to require the 

Property Officer to: (a) ensure that POs are duly accomplished and with all the 

data needed in accordance with its official design to serve as a guide for the 

suppliers in complying with the terms and conditions of the contract and for the 

RO to have sufficient basis in demanding from the suppliers any liquidated 

damages or penalties, in case of delayed deliveries; and (b) ensure that PRs were 

received  and made the bases for the preparation of the RFQ.

Other Audit Issues 

11. Unfilled positions in the different divisions of the Accounting Service resulted in 
delayed submissions of various accounting and financial reports affecting the 

timely verification of the transactions and communication of the results thereof. 

 

EO No. 449, dated October 17, 1997 is an act realigning the organization of 

the BTr.  Section 2 of the said EO provides the organizational units of the BTr. Based 

on the BTr’s Organizational Chart, there are seven services that cater to specific 

operations and transactions, and one of which is the Accounting Service. 

 

The Accounting Service is composed of five accounting divisions, four of 

which as follows handle transactions related to the BTr’s management of the national 

treasury operations: (i) National Cash Accounting Division (NCAD); (ii) National 

Government Debt Accounting Division (NGDAD); (iii) Miscellaneous Accounts 

Accounting Division (MAAD); and (iv) Bank Reconciliation and Analysis Division 

(BRAD).  On the other hand, the BAD handles the financial transactions for the 

regular operations of the Bureau. 

 

For CY 2020, the HRMD submitted a report on the demographics of the BTr, 

showing the manpower complement of the Bureau as presented in Table 12: 

 

Table 12- Authorized Plantilla against filled position in the past five years 
Year Authorized Plantilla Filled Positions Filled Positions  

2016 1,283 694 54% 

2017 1,305 698 53% 

2018 1,305 674 52% 

2019 1,305 659 50% 

2020 1,305 622 48% 

Average Filled Positions (%) 51% 

 

As presented in Table 12, the number of filled positions in the authorized 

plantilla has been steadily decreasing for the past five years.  Additionally, 305 

personnel or 49 per cent of the 622 filled positions are in the age bracket of 51 years 

old and above. 

 

Analysis of personnel demographics in the Accounting Service disclosed that 

it has a total of 138 available plantilla positions, of which 63 positions or 46 per cent 

were filled up. Filled positions in the five Accounting Divisions ranged from 36 to 

58 per cent of available positions. 

 

Moreover, analysis of the Accounting Service’s age demographics showed 

that 43 per cent of its total manpower are in the age bracket of 50 years old and above 

as presented in Table 13.

Should the employees in this age bracket eventually retire or be separated 

from service and succession planning is not prioritized, it is likely to result to lack of 

manpower in the Accounting Service.  

 

The three Audit Teams under the COA-BTr Audit Group, through their 

respective validation of prior year audit observations and review of the CY 2020 

transactions and reports, have noted that there have been delayed submissions of 

financial reports, including the TB, FSs, JEVs, and FARs.  The delays in the 

submission of these reports and documents affected the timely verification of 

financial accounts and transactions and communication of the audit results to 

Management. The lack of manpower, coupled with the work arrangement during this 

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, has undoubtedly affected the 

Accounting Service’s performance. 

 

Consequently, in response to the said observations, Management has agreed 

to provide additional personnel to handle the organization of the JEVs and the 

preparation of related reports/documents to help improve the timeliness of the 

submission of the required reports to the Audit Teams.  

 

In its effort to fill up its manpower complement, the BTr has made numerous 

appointments for the past year. Based on information from the HRMD, hiring of 20 

new applicants, four transfers from other divisions, and 24 promotions for the BTr’s 

CO and ROs were processed. Despite such efforts, numerous positions in the plantilla 

remain unfilled. The inability to fill up the BTr’s plantilla may very well result in the 

inefficiency and inability of the BTr to deliver its products and services to its various 

stakeholders. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Chief, HRMD, in 

coordination with the various Accounting Divisions of the BTr, to fast track the 

processing and screening of qualified applicants, and their hiring.

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

12. COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, negative Special Allotment Release Orders totaling P112.111 

million were issued to adjust the appropriations of the Bureau pursuant to RA No. 

11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act for the COVID-19 response/recovery. 

Moreover, funds were not given for COVID-19 response and/or recovery. Instead, 

the Bureau utilized its own budget for the related expenses. The COVID-19-related 

expenses charged to PS and MOOE totaled P5.733 million. Details are presented in 

Table 14.

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of AO No. 2020-0015 of the Department of Health 

(DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides that at the 

minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings 

depending on their Risk Severity Grading. For each prescribed intervention, concrete 

examples of corresponding hazard controls [e.g. engineering control, administrative 

control, and personal protective equipment’s (PPE)] are provided. For administrative 

controls and PPE for offices/workplace, the list includes provision of tissue, masks, 

among others. On the other hand, engineering and administrative controls include 

placement of handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-

based solution in all entrances, exits and areas with high foot traffic and facilities. 

 

Review of Office Supplies Expenses, Other Supplies and Materials Expenses 

and Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses showed that the Bureau procured 

facemasks, face shields, and various health and safety protective and hygienic 

supplies and conducted the regular disinfection for a total cost of P1.559 million. 

Included in the total cost were expenses of P350,850.00 related to the conduct of 



81 

 

Rapid Test and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction for its employees 

and outsourced personnel to mitigate the spread of the virus.    

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the Enhanced Community 

Quarantine (ECQ)/Modified ECQ (MECQ) 

 

Section 1 of AO No. 26 of the Office of the President authorized the NGAs 

to grant COVID-19 hazard pay to personnel who physically reported for work during 

the implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantines in their respective work 

stations, in an amount not exceeding P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-

19 Hazard Pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 

Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the 

DBM, subject to the following guidelines and conditions:  

 

i. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are 
workers engaged through Contract of Service (COS), JO, or other similar 

schemes. 

 

ii. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work 
at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working 

hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of 

Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or 

work station. 

 

iii. The total rate of the COVID-19 hazard pay shall be based on the number of 
days an employee/worker physically reports for work during ECQ period 

using the formula under Section 1, which is P500 x No. of days physically 

reporting for work during the quarantine period. 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay, Other General 

Services, and Other Professional Services for CY 2020 disclosed that the Bureau 

granted COVID-19 hazard pay at P500/day to regular/plantilla officials and 

employees and JO personnel totaling P3.640 million and P0.534 million, 

respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ and Modified ECQ (MECQ) in 

the country. 

 

Verification of the relevant DVs on the grant of hazard pay showed that the 

payments were supported with office order/s of BTr employees authorized to work 

during the ECQ and MECQ DTRs and summary of all BTr personnel who actually 

rendered service as Skeleton Work Force during the ECQ and MECQ.

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

13. Unaccomplished GAD-activities had not supported the government’s effort, 
among others, in the empowerment of women and the practice of gender-

responsive governance, and had not ensured accurate reporting on GAD 

activities. 

 

The consolidated report on the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and the 

Accomplishment Report (AR) for FY 2020 submitted to the Audit Team showed that 

a total of 50 activities with a total budget of P7.528 million are to be implemented by 

the Bureau. Out of this, 23 activities were not implemented, among others, are as

The non-accomplishment of the planned activities is mainly due to the 

restrictions imposed by the government for mass gatherings in response to the 

COVID-19 pandemic and non-availability of resource persons to do online 

trainings/seminars. It had not also supported the government’s efforts in the 

empowerment of women and the practice of gender-responsive governance. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the GFPS 

Chairperson and GAD-TWG to prioritize the implementation of planned GAD 

activities for the Bureau to contribute to the achievement of the government’s 

GAD-related objectives.  

 

 

Information and Publicity on Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs) 

 

14. Signboard was not posted to inform the public of the project undertaken by the 
Bureau, thus depriving them of the full disclosure of all transactions involving 

public interest.  

 



84 

 

Section 1.1 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 provides, 

among others, that, subject to reasonable conditions provided by law, the State 

implements a policy of full disclosure of all transactions involving public interest and 

recognizes the right of the people to information on matters of public concern as 

enunciated in Section 28, Article II and Section 7, Article III, respectively, of the 

1987 Constitution. 

 

Consistent with the above policy and as provided under Sec. 2.2.1 thereof, all 

government agencies or the implementing unit, office or division as the case may be, 

shall notify the public of their PPAs through the posting of relevant information on 

signboards, blackboards, whiteboards, posters, tarpaulins, streamers, electronic 

boards or similar materials (collectively, “Signboards”) not exceeding 3 ft. by 2 ft., 

in conspicuous places within the Bureau premises, and in the venue where the PPA 

is located or carried.  This requirement applies to all government PPAs, regardless of 

amount or source of funds.  

 

Site visit on the project implemented by the RO IX in Pagadian City showed 

that the repair of the office building for a contract cost of P199,419.00 was without 

signage/signboard, thus, transparency and accountability in the implementation of its 

project and the right of the people to information on matters of public concern have 

not been assured.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

implementing unit to provide the signage/signboard for the posting of relevant 

and detailed information on the on-going government PPAs.  

 

 

15. Bayanihan Grant to Provinces, Cities and Municipalities  
 

Pursuant to RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, wherein the 

President of the Philippines was granted the power to adopt various temporary 

emergency measures to respond to the crisis brought about by the COVID-19, the 

DBM issued Local Budget Circular (LBC) Nos. 125 and 126 dated April 7, 2020 and 

April 13, 2020 to prescribe guidelines and procedures on the release and utilization 

of the Bayanihan Grant to Cities and Municipalities (BGCM) and Bayanihan Grant 

to Provinces (BGP), respectively.  

 

For BGCM, the transferred grants totalling P30.823 billion was equivalent to

interventions.

16. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) and Programs related 
to Youth 

 

Senior citizens, persons with disability, as well as pregnant women are given 

priority in their transactions with the Bureau. Comfortable waiting areas are provided 

to ensure their comfort while waiting for their concerns to be attended to. 

 

With regards to programs related to youth, the RO XI conducted various 

programs and activities which focused on youth development and empowerment. The 

said RO conducted  financial literacy trainings and awareness for the Sangguniang 

Kabataan (SK) Officials particularly on Public Bonding Laws, Treasury Guidelines 

on SK Fidelity Bonding, Guidelines on the Appropriation, Release, Planning and 

Budgeting Process for the SK Funds (NYC-DBM-DILG Joint MC 1-2019), and the 

use of  the Handbook on the Financial Transactions of the SK (COA Circular 2020-

003). 

 

 

17. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortizations, and  PhilHealth Premium Contributions 
 

The BTr had not fully complied with the withholding and remittances of 

taxes, and with the remittance within the prescribed period of the other mandatory 

deductions, such as premiums/contributions, and loan amortizations pursuant to the 

regulations issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), GSIS, Pag-IBIG and 

PhilHealth. Details are presented in Table 18.

Non-withholding of taxes on the hazard pay granted to BTr officials and employees 

 

Section 2.78.1(B)(13) of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98, as amended by RR 

No. 11–18 provides that hazard pay is only exempt from income tax if given to 

Minimum Wage Earners (MWEs) who “were actually assigned to danger or strife-

torn areas, disease-infected places, or in distressed or isolated camps, which expose 



87 

 

them to great danger or contagion or peril to life.” If the precondition is not satisfied, 

the hazard pay is deemed taxable. Thus, if the employee is not a MWE or the monthly 

salary is more than P20,833.00, any hazard pay given is taxable even if the employee 

works in areas that pose health risks due to unavoidable exposure to infectious 

diseases and the dangers of COVID-19, like hospitals, or other frontline work. 

 

Verification of the JEVs and DVs relating to the grant of hazard pay revealed 

that the corresponding taxes from the payments to the BTr officials and employees 

in the CO, NCR, and ROs I and VII, whose monthly salary exceeded the minimum 

wage of P20,833.00, were not withheld. Thus,  Due to BIR was understated by at least 

P361,763.33 and income taxes on hazard pay were not remitted to the BIR. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants 

to instruct the personnel handling the payroll and other benefits to withhold 

taxes on hazard pay and remit the same to the BIR. 

  

 

18. GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

In compliance with RA No. 656, all the insurable properties of the Bureau 

were insured with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS except for ROs 

NCR and III while  there were no information on the insurance of properties for  the 

ROs IV-B, VII, and X.  
 

In the BTr NCR, except for the motor vehicle, all other PPE items totaling 

P1.614 million were not insured with the GIF of the GSIS. Interview with the Acting 

Accountant disclosed that the BTr NCR assumed that the other PPE items were 

insured by the BTr CO. However, review of the PIF of the BTr CO revealed that no 

insurance was acquired specifically for the BTr NCR.  

 

In the RO III,  only the RO building, including some of its contents, and its 

service vehicle were insured with the GIF of the GSIS. All other properties of the RO 

particularly those items situated in the five Treasury Provincial Offices were not 

covered with any insurance protection against damage or loss.  Although the annual 

renewal of their insurance policy is consistently applied with the GSIS starting CY 

2017, the sum insured for the RO building and its contents remained the same. On 

that account, the costs of additional properties purchased/transferred to the Bureau as 

well as the capitalizable costs for the improvement/betterment of the building from 

CY 2018 to the present were excluded in the insurance coverage.  

 

Further, it was observed that the allocated budget or funds for the payment of 

insurance premiums is insufficient to cover all of their insurable properties. Additions 

and other adjustments to the properties of the Bureau were overlooked and left 

unnoticed during the renewal process, thus, the inadequacy of funds have contributed 

to the insufficiency of insurance coverage for the insurable PPE.   

 



88 

 

The non-compliance by the BTr NCR and RO III with the Property Insurance 

Law exposed the ROs to the risk of not being indemnified or compensated for any 

damage to the government properties, or destruction caused by fire, earthquake, flood 

or other casualty.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting 

Property Officer in the BTr NCR to secure insurance for all the RO’s PPE from 

the GSIS to ensure indemnification in case of loss or damages and thereafter, 

ensure prompt renewal of the insurance for continuity of coverage. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned 

officials in RO III to: (i) request budget/funds to cover the payment of premiums 

for the general insurance of all insurable properties and other assets including 

the contents of the TPOs and  the improvements/ betterments of the RO 

Building, as well as any additions/transfers of its contents based on their latest 

appraised value; and (ii) secure from the GSIS, the necessary insurance 

coverage of the RO  properties and cause the payment of total insurance 

premiums pertaining thereto. 

 

 

19. Hiring of Job Order and Contractual Personnel 
   

 Section 7.4 of Civil Service Commission (CSC)-COA-DBM Joint Circular 

No. 1 s. 2017 dated June 15, 2017 states that the services of the contract of service 

and job order (JO) workers are not covered by the Civil Service laws and rules, thus, 

not creditable as government service. The JOs do not enjoy the benefits enjoyed by 

government employees, such as leave, PERA, RATA and thirteenth month pay. 

 

For CY 2020, the Bureau hired a total of 128 JO workers to augment its 

workforce, in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s. 2020 dated 

October 20, 2020 on Updates Rules and Regulations Governing the COS and JO 

Workers in the Government, as amended. 

 

Audit of disbursements in the ROs NCR, II, III, IV-B, VI, VII, IX, XI and 

XIII revealed that the Bureau granted various allowances and benefits to its JO 

worker totalling P0.609 million as follows: 

 

Table 19 – Additional benefits and allowances 

Particulars Total Amount 

Year-end Assessment P        218,000.00 

Grocery Allowance 231,000.00

Thanksgiving Day 52,000.00 

Online Strategic Planning and Team Building Activity 40,500.00 

Total P        609,100.00 

 



89 

 

Granting of benefits enjoyed by government employees to the JO personnel 

had unnecessarily increased the Bureau’s expenses. 

 

We recommended that Management refrain from granting additional 

benefits and/or allowances to its job order personnel. 

  

 

20. Status of Settlements of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, the ROs II and IV-A issued Notices of Suspensions (NS) 

amounting to P0.896 million and P0.590 million, respectively, and the same were 

settled during the year.  

 

The status of NSs, Notices of Disallowances (NDs), and Notices of Charges 

(NCs) is shown in Table 20.
