EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
  

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) is mandated to perform, among others, the 

functions of management of cash resources and expenditures of the National 

Government (NG) and management of public debts under various laws and issuances.   

 

One of the many components of the BTr are the Regional Offices (ROs) which 

include all Provincial/District Offices (POs/DOs) that report directly to the Treasurer 

of the Philippines (TOP).  

 

These ROs are mandated to examine the books of accounts of national collecting 

officers and local treasurers; monitor the reports of POs; provide technical advice and 

support to government field representatives in the implementation of laws, rules and 

regulations governing Treasury operations; recommend Fidelity Bond claims to the 

TOP for payment, chargeable against the Fidelity Fund; and consolidate daily reports 

on national collections and disbursements submitted by the POs. 
 

The BTr is headed by the TOP and assisted by three Deputy Treasurers of the 

Philippines. 

 

For CY 2020, BTr has a total manpower complement of 772 personnel.  Permanent 

plantilla positions totaled 615 and 7 co-terminus appointment status. To augment the 

manpower needs, BTr hired job order personnel totaling 150, of which 61 were hired 

in the Central Office (CO) and 89 in the ROs.

The decrease in the appropriations, allotments, obligations and disbursements was due 

to the discontinuance of 35 per cent of the programmed appropriations under the FY 

2020 General Appropriations Act in response to Republic Act No. 11469 or Bayanihan 

to Heal as One Act for the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) response/recovery. 

 

 

C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of the BTr and its ROs, for 

the year ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on management's assertions on the financial statements; 

(b) determine the propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance with 

pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend measures to improve agency 

operations; and (d) determine the extent of the implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 
   
 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based approach in the audit of the FSs of the BTr-Proper and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others: (i) examined financial and accounting procedures 

adopted by the BTr and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls 

regulating financial operations; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a representative 

sample of selected transactions; (iv) carried out review, on test check basis, of a 

number of contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of assets, 



   
 

iii 

 

liabilities, revenues, and expenses; and, (v) conducted interviews and held discussions 

with the concerned officials and staff in the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of the Audit Observation Memoranda. 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the consolidated 

financial statements of the BTr-Proper for CY 2020 due to accounting errors affecting 

Trust Liabilities, Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable, Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit), Other Payables, Other Property, Plant and Equipment, Power 

Supply Systems, Accounts Payable, Advances to Special Disbursing Officers, 

Advances to Officers and Employees, Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses, 

Advances for Payroll, Buildings, Repairs and Maintenance-Buildings, Other 

Structures, Other Personnel Benefits, Terminal Leave Benefits, and Furniture and 

Fixtures, , as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail under 

Part II-Observations and Recommendations of this report. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors in the keeping of the accounts had resulted in the 
misstatements in some assets, liabilities and equity accounts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  (a) require the concerned 

personnel of the Bureau Accounting Division (BAD) and Accountants of 

Regional Offices (ROs) to prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to 

correct the aforementioned errors; and (b) henceforth, observe the 

proper/correct recognition of accounts and transactions in accordance with 

the GAM for NGAs and other applicable rules and regulations. 

 

2. Delayed/non- submission of reports and/or documents such as Disbursement 
Vouchers (DVs), Trial Balances (TBs), FSs, Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs), 

Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) and Budget and Financial Accountability 

Reports (BFARs) precluded the timely verification of financial accounts and 

transactions, and communication of audit results to Management, among others. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: (a) the Chief, BAD, 

Accountants of ROs II and III, and Acting Accountant, NCR to (i) improve 

on the submission of the required financial reports, JEVs and supporting 

documents to reduce the delays in their submission to the Audit Team; and 



   
 

iv 

 

(ii) submit the JEVs with the monthly TB/FSs to facilitate the verification of 

the recognized transactions in the books;  (b) Acting Accountant, NCR to 

include as performance indicator in the Individual Performance 

Commitment and Review  of the concerned Accounting personnel the 

timeliness of the submission of the assigned documents/reports; and  (c) 

Acting Cashier of BTr NCR to obtain the validated copies of Lists of Due and 

Demandable Accounts Payable – Advice to Debit Account from the Land 

Bank of the Philippines to support the disbursements from the Notices of 

Cash Allocation. 

     

3. Disbursements totaling P7.562 million for various activities implemented and 
payments made for grocery allowance and annual physical and medical 

examination in the amounts of P5.360 million and P265,200.00, respectively, 

despite the lack of proper authorization and adequate supporting documents to 

support the claims unnecessarily increased the Bureau’s expenses and had not 

enabled the determination of the validity of the expenses incurred. 

 
We recommend that Management require the: (a) concerned accountable 

officers to submit to the Acting Accountant/Accountants the required 

documents to support the liquidation of their respective cash advances for 

verification; and (b) Acting Accountant/Accountants to submit the 

Liquidation Reports and complete supporting documents to the Audit Team.  

 

We also recommend that Management refrain from granting additional 

benefits and/or allowances to its employees without prior approval from the 

Office of the President. 

4. Unfilled positions in the different divisions of the Accounting Service resulted in 
delayed submissions of various accounting and financial reports affecting the 

timely verification of the transactions and communication of the results thereof. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Chief, Human Resource 

Management Division, in coordination with the various Accounting Divisions 

of the BTr, to fast track the processing and screening of qualified applicants, 

and their hiring. 
 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

discussed with Management during the exit conference on June 2, 2021. 

Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspension, Disallowances and Charges 
 

There was no Notice of Charge (NC) issued in CY 2020. However, total Notices of 

Suspension (NS) and Notices of Disallowances (ND) issued during the year 

amounted to P1.486 million and P23,932.00, respectively, while the total issued 



   
 

v 

 

Notice of Settlement of Suspension/Disallowance/Charge) was P1.617 million, 

leaving a balance of P1.111 million as at December 31, 2020. The BTr also has prior 

years’ disallowances in the total amount of P247,381.98, which were appealed by the 

Management.  

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Out of the 110 prior years’ audit recommendations, 49 were implemented and 61 

were not implemented. The details are discussed in Part III of this report. 

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
