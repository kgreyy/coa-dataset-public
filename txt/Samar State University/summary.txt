EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



Samar State University (SSU) was first known as Samar Trade School upon its establishment in 1912, serving as laboratory shop of the Samar Provincial High School.  Made later as a purely secondary trade school, it had its first graduation exercise in 1932.  On June 21, 1959, by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2435, the Samar Trade School was converted to Samar School of Arts and Trades (SSAT).  It was authorized to offer a two-year technical curriculum in various vocational courses and later the school was given the leeway to offer the four-year teacher-education curriculum, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE); and the four-year technical education curriculum, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology (BSIT). 



Batas Pampanga Blg. 323 passed on September 7, 1982 converted the SSAT into Samar State Polytechnic College (SSPC).  From serving as a laboratory shop of a provincial school, it has metamorphosed into a training ground of not only secondary but also tertiary, masteral and doctoral students.  On August 7, 2004, by virtue of R.A. No. 9313, SSPC was converted into SSU.  The University now comprises four campuses, namely: Catbalogan (Main) Campus, Mercedes Campus, Paranas Campus and Basey Campus.



The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations of SSU for calendar year 2020.  The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with  applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

C)	Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



	The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of SSU for CY 2020.  As discussed in Part II of this Report, the year-end balances of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE); Inventory; Construction in Progress – Buildings and Other Structures; Accounts Receivable; Allowance for Impairment - Accounts Receivable; and  Due to BIR accounts were unreliable which affected the fair presentation of the financial statements.  Likewise, the reported net loss at year end from the University’s Income Generating Projects (IGPs) was unreliable due to the absence of financial statements, journals and ledgers for each  project. 





D)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



	The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)	The procurement of supplies to help prevent the spread of COVID 19 amounting to P743,000.00 was made through cash advances, which is not in accordance with Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 03-2020 dated March 09, 2020; GPPB Circular 04-2016 dated 20 December 2016; and the COA and GPPB Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 1 dated March 26, 2020.  

  

We recommended that the University President stop the practice of procuring supplies and materials for COVID-19 through cash advances, and instead follow the procurement methods recommended under GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020 dated March 09, 2020, GPPB Circular 04-2016 dated 20 December 2016, and COA and GPPB Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 dated March 26, 2020, and the guidelines enumerated under the GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020, so that government resources are utilized efficiently and safeguarded against misappropriation.  



2)	The GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) of SSU was neither submitted to the Audit Team on time nor properly accomplished.  Likewise, there were underutilized GAD Funds, contrary to Philippine Commission on Women-National Economic Development Authority-Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 and COA Circular No. 2014-001.  



We recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Person and other personnel concerned to: (a) ensure that the GAD AR is submitted to the Audit Team within the period prescribed in item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001; (b) ensure that the GAD AR is prepared in accordance with Annex B of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-1; (c) monitor the actual expenditures relative to GAD Funds and provide the summary of expenses with details of Check Date and Number, Disbursement Voucher Number and Payee to facilitate validation; (d) maximize the utilization of the GAD funds through the implementation of GAD-related programs and projects in order to attain the objective for which these funds were provided; and (e) strictly comply with item 6.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 in attributing GAD Funds.  

   

	The above audit observations and recommendations were communicated to management through Audit Observation Memoranda, and their comments are incorporated in the report, where appropriate.



	

E)	Compliance with Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Act of 1997
