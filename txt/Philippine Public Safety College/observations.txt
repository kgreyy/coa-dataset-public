PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial and Compliance Audit



Unliquidated Cash Advance 



1)	Cash advances (CAs) totaling P26,210,254.90 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 due to the failure of Accountable Officers (AOs) to submit liquidation reports, contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  



1)	Section 4.1 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the guidelines in the granting and utilization of CA. It states that:



  4.1.1      x   x   x;



    4.1.2  No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made;



4.1.3   A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.



2)	Section 5.1 and 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 requires full liquidation of CAs for salaries, wages, petty operating expenses, current operating expenditures and official travel within the period provided for in Paragraph 5 thereof, to wit:



5.1 The Accountable Officer (AO) shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:



5.1.1 Salaries, Wages, etc. – within 5 days after each 15 day/end of the month pay period.



5.1.2 Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses within 20 days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment during the year.



5.1.3 Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel.



Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of his salary and the institution of other sanctions as provided for under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 hereof.



5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund the unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



5.9 At the start of an ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash advance is submitted. However, when no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO’s salary.



3)	At year end, the total unliquidated CAs in the books of PPSC amounted to P26,210,254.90, broken down below:

4)	Advances for Payroll account represents CAs granted to disbursing officers intended to pay the honoraria and salaries and wages of key personnel which remained unliquidated at year-end due to failure of AOs to submit liquidation documents. 



5)	On the other hand, Advances to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) are intended for maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), while Advances to Officers and Employees are for local travels of the PPSC personnel. 



6)	Adjustment pertains to the reclassification of various unliquidated CAs of transferred/separated personnel pursuant to R.A. No. 11279 dated April 12, 2019.

8)	Based on the aging schedule, the past due accounts pertained to the unliquidated CAs of officers and employees who are still in the active service.



9)	Final Demand Letters dated December 21, 2020 were prepared and signed by the PPSC President and were sent to the AOs demanding the liquidation/refund of their unliquidated CAs. Demand letters dated January 25, 2021 were likewise sent by the Audit Team to various AOs, but the response has yet to be received by the COA-PPSC.  



10)	Management explained that the AOs encountered difficulties in the completion of liquidation documents due to the volume of transactions considering the current situation where movement of personnel is limited in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Moreover, these liquidation documents are submitted all together at the PPSC HO.



11)	Considering the length of time that has elapsed, these CAs should have been expended or utilized. However, due to failure of the AOs to submit the liquidation reports/documents, the corresponding expenditures could not be taken up in the books which tends to overstate the other assets accounts and understate the expenses accounts by as much as P26,210,254.90 as at year-end.



12)	On the other hand, Management was able to effect salary deductions to various accountable officers in active service to settle their outstanding CAs during the year. 



13)	We recommended that Management:



a)	direct the AOs to immediately submit liquidation reports together with the required documentations; 



b)	adhere strictly to the rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of CAs pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997;



c)	require the concerned officers and employees in active service to liquidate/refund their outstanding balances or effect deductions from their salaries until full recovery of the amount; and



d)	strictly implement the provision in the final demand letter directing the withholding of salary and endorsement of the same for the filing of appropriate charges in court should the AO failed to settle the said obligation on the date demanded.



14)	Management commented that they will strictly adhere to the existing rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of CAs pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  



15)	Withholding of salaries is being implemented for AOs who are in the active service. 



16)	Of the unliquidated CAs as of December 31, 2020, 33.41 percent or P11,201,776.50 was already liquidated as of February 28, 2021.



Unreliable Inventory balances



2)	The reported balances of the Inventory accounts totaling P111,475,421.92 as of December 31, 2020 are misstated by P110,197,447.08 due to inclusion of inventories already issued caused by delayed/non-submission of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) by the Regional Supply Officer of the Constitutive Units and Supply Officer of the PPSC Head Office. In addition, complete and updated Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) and Stock Card (SC) were not maintained contrary to Sections 13 and Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



1)	Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the Inventory Accounting System and the conduct of Physical Count of Inventory semi-annually, to wit:



Sec. 13. Inventory Accounting System.  The Inventory Accounting system consists of the system of monitoring, controlling, and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory. xxx



Physical count/inventory, which is required, semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.



2)	Likewise, Section 17 provides the prescribed records, forms and reports to be prepared and maintained for the accounting of Inventory, as follows:



The following records, forms and reports are prescribed for use:



a)	 Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 38) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time it shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock.  The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card. 



b)	 Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 37) – shall be used to record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials.  The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card. xxx 



c)	 Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the supplies and materials issued. Xxx 

	

d)	 Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any.  These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS.  The Inventory Accounting System consists of the system of monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory. Xxx

4)	Audit of the Inventory accounts revealed the following deficiencies:



a)	Verification of the submitted RPCI for the 2nd semester of CY 2020 and accounting records revealed a discrepancy amounting to P110,197,447.08 due to delayed/non-submission of RSMI duly supported with Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) by the Regional Supply Officer of Constitutive Units and the Supply Officer in the Head Office, ranging from one to two years.

b)	 No reconciliation of accounting and property records. The Accounting and Supply Sections failed to maintain an updated and complete SLC and SC due to lack of manpower to update and complete the same. 



5)	Inquiry with the Management disclosed that additional personnel were provided to Supply Section to expedite the updating and completion of SC while non-submission of RSMI was attributed to the delayed submission of RIS due to voluminous transactions.



6)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)	Chief Accountant, Supply Officer and Inventory Committee to account/investigate discrepancies between the accounting and property records and the RPCI and effect necessary adjustments to bring balances in agreement;



b)	Supply Officer and Regional Supply Officer to explain the delayed/non-submission of RSMI duly supported with RIS and expedite the immediate preparation and submission of the same to the Accounting Section to facilitate appropriate and timely recording of inventory issuances in the books of accounts; and



c)	Chief Accountant and Supply Officer to expedite completion and updating of SLCs and SCs for each type of supplies and materials and reconcile records regularly/periodically to establish the correctness of the inventory account balances.



7)	During the exit conference, Management acknowledged that the discrepancies noted between the balance per books and RPCI were due to the non-recording of issuances of supplies and materials in the books of accounts in view of the non-submission of RSMIs and doubtful existence of the reported inventory balances.



	1)	Supply and Accounting Sections are making follow ups on the submission of RSMI by Constitutive Units and training units. For PPSC-Head Office, Chief Supply Section is still gathering the RIS to facilitate the preparation of RSMI. Reconciliation of property and accounting records will be conducted regularly.



Unreliable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) balances



3)	The accuracy, existence and reliability of the PPE accounts totaling P1,434,598,042.11 as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained  due to: (a) non-reconciliation of the Property Card (PC) and the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC); and (b) incomplete annual physical count; hence, incomplete submission of  Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2020 and Prior Years, contrary to Section 38 and Section 42, Chapter 10 of the  GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



1)	The periodic physical count of PPE shall be done annually in compliance to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I which states that:



The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year.  This shall be submitted to the auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year.  Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



2)	Section 42 thereof provides the accounting and property records to be maintained for PPE.



The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.



The following are the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE: 



a)	 Property Card (Appendix 70) – this card shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the description, acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other information about the PPE. It shall be kept for each class of PPE. 



b)	 Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (Appendix 71) – this card shall be used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other information about the property. It shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting Office/Unit. 



c)	 Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.



3)	Further, Appendix 73 of GAM for NGAs Volume II provides that the RPCPPE shall be certified correct by the Inventory Committee Chair and Members, approved by the Head of Agency/Entity or his/her Authorized Representative, and verified by the COA.



4)	The reported balances of the PPE accounts as at year-end consists of the following:

5)	Audit of the PPE accounts revealed the following:



a)	Non-reconciliation of PCs and PPELCs with total discrepancy of P1,890,010,156.61 due to non-maintenance of complete and updated PCs by the Supply Section;



b)	Only RPCPPE - Transportation Equipment and Facilities for CY 2020 was submitted because inventory taking for other PPE accounts was not completed due to limitations brought about by the pandemic. Verification of the same revealed the following deficiencies:



--	The RPCPPE for Transportation Equipment and Facilities did not conform with the prescribed format in Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II;



--	Type of PPE was not properly identified/classified; and



--	Signatories of said report were personnel from General Services Section and not the members of the Inventory Committee and Head of the Agency or his/her Authorized Representative as prescribed in the above-mentioned regulations;



6)	Inquiry with the Agency’s Inventory Committee disclosed that preparation of RPCPPE for other accounts is on-going and completion of the same was delayed in view of the situations/limitations brought about by Covid-19 pandemic; thus, inventory report was not submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



7)	In view of the noted deficiencies, the accuracy and reliability of the year-end balance of the PPE accounts could not be ascertained.  

 

8)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)	Inventory Committee to:



i)	expedite immediate completion of the RPCPPE and facilitate subsequent submission to the Office of the Auditor; 



ii)	ensure compliance with the requirements of Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II on the preparation/accomplishment of RPCPPE and provide all required information/data;



b)	Supply Officer to:



i)	explain the non-maintenance of complete and updated PCs for each category of PPE; 



ii)	strictly adhere with the requirements under Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I on the maintenance of PCs and regular reconciliation with the accounting records; 



c)	Chief Accountant to regularly reconcile the PPELC with the property records to establish the correctness of reported balances.



9)	Management commented that the Inventory Committee is on the process of expediting the preparation of the RPCPPE.



10)	Supply Section is on the process of establishing the PCs since there was no turnover of property records from the previous Supply Officer. Reconciliation of property and accounting records will be conducted regularly.  







Due to PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and GSIS



4)	Government share and personnel contributions pertaining to PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and GSIS in the total amount of P11,435,236.50 for the period CY 2017 to CY 2019 remained unremitted as of December 31, 2020, contrary to the provisions of Republic Act No. 7875 (PhilHealth Law), Republic Act No. 9679 (Pag-IBIG Law) and Republic Act No. 8291 (GSIS Law).



1)	R.A. No. 7875 otherwise known as An Act instituting a National Health Insurance Program for all Filipinos and establishing the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation for the purpose provides the guidelines in the withholding and remittance of contributions pertaining to PhilHealth Fund.

5)	The afore-mentioned government shares and personnel contributions were previously recorded as Accounts Payable and was reclassified only to its appropriate liability accounts in December 2020 pursuant to the audit recommendation.  However, the same remained unremitted as of year-end.



6)	We recommended that Management instruct the Chief Accountant to facilitate the immediate remittance of government shares and personnel contributions pertaining to PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and GSIS for the period CY 2017-2019 which remained outstanding as of year-end and ensure that all mandatory contributions are remitted on time.



7)	Management explained that the non-remittance of the PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and GSIS government shares and personnel contributions came to their attention during the preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) when they discovered that there were stale checks in the possession of the liaison officer. The delayed preparation of BRS was due to the delayed receipt of Bank Statements.



8)	Management also commented that the former liaison officer prevented the early discovery of the non-remittance by issuing certificate of remittance using fake receipts. Management was able to recover the stale checks from the liaison officer prior to the termination of his service from PPSC in January 2021.



9)	The Management is coordinating with the concerned government agencies to effect the immediate remittance of the government shares and personnel contributions pertaining to PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and GSIS that are yet to be remitted.



Auditor’s Rejoinder

	 

10)	Per validation, 42 stale checks totaling P16,227,041.64 were recovered from the former liaison officer. Details will be further verified this CY 2021 and shall be prioritized in audit.  



Covid-19 Funds



5)	The effects brought about by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic to health, safety, security and livelihood of the Filipinos became a driving force to declare a state of national emergency to enable government agencies to reprogram, realign or reallocate government funds to mitigate, if not contain, the transmission of Covid-19. 



1)	Officials and personnel of the PPSC were no exception to the risks and effects of the Covid-19 outbreak.  As such, health protocols and lock-downs were being implemented during the pandemic to mitigate, if not contain, the transmission of Covid-19 in the Head Office and Constitutive Units under its jurisdiction.



2)	For CY 2020, the Agency has realigned funds for the procurement of various supplies and equipment necessary for the prevention/mitigation of Covid-19 since PPSC did not receive any additional fund related to the current pandemic. Details are as follows:

5)	Section 3 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020 provides the procedures to be undertaken in the procurement of various supplies and equipment thru emergency procurement under the Bayanihan Act.  Item 3.6 and Section 9 thereof provide the following:



Item 3.6   The BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post for information purposes the Notice of Award (NOA), contract, or purchase order in (i) the website of the PE or if none, any conspicuous place in the premises of the PE; and (ii) the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once it becomes operational.



Section 9. An online GPPB portal shall be established to promote accountability and transparency in the conduct of Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act. The PEs shall post in the GPPB online portal for information purposes the updated APP, NOA, and other information relative to the Procurement Projects undertaken pursuant to this Circular. This online portal shall be the source of data or information which shall be used by the GPPB and its Technical Support Office to comply with the reportorial requirements under the Bayanihan Act.



6)	As such, GPPB Advisory No. 04-2020 dated April 27, 2020 was issued for the establishment of GPPB Online Portal for emergency procurement under R.A. No. 11469 or the Bayanihan Act.



7)	GPPB Advisory No. 05 dated June 17, 2020 was likewise issued to reiterate that the posting of the foregoing information on the GPPB Online Portal for Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act is mandatory and all PEs are enjoined to observe strict compliance therewith.



8)	Inquiry with the Management disclosed that the mandatory posting requirement of emergency procurement documents such as Updated APP, Notice of Award (NOA) and other information relative to the Procurement Projects undertaken was overlooked in view of the volume of transactions taking into consideration the current pandemic where workforce is limited and in skeletal arrangement.



9)	We commended Management’s compliance to A.O. No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 relative to the payment of Covid-19 Hazard Pay to authorized government personnel who physically reported for work during the period of implementation of the ECQ.



10)	On the other hand, we recommended that Management require the BAC, PPSC-HO and NFTI, through its respective BAC Secretariat to: (i) explain the non-compliance with the mandatory posting of Updated APP, NOA and other information relative to the procurement projects undertaken that are required to be posted in the GPPB Online Portal; and (ii) facilitate the immediate posting of the emergency procurement documents in accordance with the afore-mentioned regulations and as part of the Agency’s commitment towards transparency and accountability.



11)	Management acknowledged the lapses relative to non-posting of emergency procurement documents in the GPPB Online Portal due to limitations/situations brought about by the current pandemic. 



12)	NFTI BAC informed the Audit Team that the mandatory posting of emergency procurement documents for procurement projects undertaken under the Bayanihan acts was already complied with while PPSC-HO BAC has already created an account at the GPPB Online Portal, pending approval, and will facilitate the immediate posting of the required procurement documents.



Gender and Development



6)	The Agency’s Gender and Development Plans and Budgets (GPB) for FY 2020 were not duly endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) due to non-submission of the revised/enhanced GPB taking into consideration the PCW’s requested revisions/recommendations contrary to the provisions of PCW-DBM-NEDA Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02 dated August 1, 2019. Moreover, the Agency expended only the total amount of P23,340,597.04 for GAD related activities which is equivalent to four percent of the Agency’s adjusted appropriations of P583,918,684.00 due to suspension of various activities caused by Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.



1)	Section 31 of the General Provisions of CY 2020 GAA states that all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development Plan (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).

PPSC was given 30 days to comply with the requested revisions/recommendations and required to resubmit the same to PCW for further review and endorsement, if warranted.



4)	However, the Agency was not able to resubmit the revised/enhanced GPB for FY 2020 for failure to comply with PCW’s recommendations due to time constraints and intended GAD training for PPSC personnel scheduled in April 2020 was cancelled in view of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) being implemented as early as March 2020 brought about by Covid-19 pandemic.



5)	For FY 2020, the PPSC allocated the amount of P34,728,759.60 or equivalent to 5.58 percent of the Agency’s appropriations of P622,829,000.00 for its client and organization-focused GAD activities.  However, the Agency expended the amount of P23,340,597.04 or equivalent to four percent of the Agency’s adjusted appropriations of P583,918,684.00 due to suspension of various activities caused by Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
