C)	SCOPE OF AUDIT



	The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PPSC for CY 2020. 





D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion in view of the misstatements to the total assets equivalent to 7.16 percent due to: a) overstatement of the Other Assets accounts by P5,544,308.70 attributable to unrecorded expenses caused by delayed submission of liquidation reports; and b) non-recording of issuances of supplies and materials amounting to P110,197,447.08 in the proper accounting period which affected the fair presentation of the FS.  Moreover, non-completion of physical count of PPE with book value of P1,434,598,042.11 and non-preparation/submission of RPCPPE affected the reliability of the PPE accounts.  The Matrix on the Analysis of Effects of Misstatements on the Financial Statements is presented in Annex B.





E)	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	Cash advances (CAs) totaling P26,210,254.90 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 due to the failure of the Accountable Officers (AOs) to submit liquidation reports, contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management: a) direct the AOs to immediately submit liquidation reports together with the required documentations; b) adhere strictly to the rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of CAs pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; c) require concerned officers and employees in active service to liquidate/refund their outstanding balances/obligations or effect deductions from their salaries until full recovery of the amount; and d) strictly implement the provision in the final demand letter directing the withholding of salary and endorsement of the same for the filing of appropriate charges in court should the AO failed to settle the said obligation on the date demanded.



2)	The reported balances of the Inventory accounts totaling P111,475,421.92 as of December 31, 2020 are misstated by P110,197,447.08 due to inclusion of inventories already issued caused by delayed/non-submission of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) by the Regional Supply Officer of the Constitutive Units and Supply Officer of the PPSC Head Office. In addition, complete and updated Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) and Stock Card (SC) were not maintained contrary to Sections 13 and Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. (Observation No. 2)

 

We recommended that Management require the: a) Chief Accountant, Supply Officer and Inventory Committee to account/investigate discrepancies between the accounting and property records and the RPCI and effect necessary adjustments to bring balances in agreement; b) Supply Officer and Regional Supply Officer to explain the delayed/non-submission of RSMI duly supported with RIS and expedite the immediate preparation and submission to the Accounting Section (AS) to facilitate appropriate and timely recording of inventory issuances in the books of accounts; and c) Chief Accountant and Supply Officer to expedite completion and updating of SLCs and SCs for each type of supplies and materials; and reconcile records regularly/periodically to establish correctness of the inventory account balances.



3)	The accuracy, existence and reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P1,434,598,042.11 as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained  due to: (a) non-reconciliation of the Property Card (PC) and the Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC); and (b) incomplete annual physical count; hence, incomplete submission of  Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2020 and Prior Years, contrary to Section 38 and Section 42, Chapter 10 of the  GAM for NGAs, Volume I. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management require the:  a) Inventory Committee to:                  (i)expedite immediate completion of the RPCPPE and facilitate subsequent submission to the Office of the Auditor; and (ii) ensure submission of the same on or before January 31 and compliance with the requirements of Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II on the preparation/accomplishment of RPCPPE and provide all required information/data; b) Supply Officer  to: (i) explain the non-maintenance of complete and updated PCs for each category of PPE; and (ii)  strictly adhere with the requirements of Section 42 Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I on the maintenance of PCs and regular reconciliation with the accounting records; and c) Chief Accountant to regularly reconcile the PPELC with the property records to establish the correctness of reported balances.



4)	Government share and personnel contributions pertaining to PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and GSIS in the total amount of P11,435,236.50 for the period CY 2017 to CY 2019 remained unremitted as of December 31, 2020 contrary to the provisions of R.A. No. 7875 (PhilHealth Law), R.A. No. 9679 (Pag-IBIG Law) and R.A. No. 8291 (GSIS Law). (Observation No. 4)
