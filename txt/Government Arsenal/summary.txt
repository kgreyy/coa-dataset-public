The mandates of the Government Arsenal are to (a) establish, operate and maintain the government arsenal; (b) formulate plans and programs to achieve self-sufficiency in arms, mortars and other weapons and munitions; (c) design, develop, manufacture, procure, stockpile and allocate arms, mortars, and other weapons and munitions without the necessity of obtaining any permits or licenses; and (d) devise ways and means for the efficient mobilization of the civilian industry to augment the production of the Arsenal in times of emergency. The key areas of the agency include the manufacture of small arms ammunition and the refurbishment of firearms for the AFP/PNP and other authorized agencies.

D.  Independent Auditor’s Report



		We rendered a qualified opinion  on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the Government Arsenal as of December 31, 2020 due to a)unreconciled difference of ₱579,129,088.41 in the Inventory account balance between the General Ledger (GL) and the inventory report; (b) non-derecognition of semi-expendable property already issued amounting to ₱90,197.31; (c) unreconciled discrepancy of ₱30,188,006.76 between the General Ledger (GL) Controlling Account for Property, Plant and Equipment and the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); (d)  inclusion to the PPE account of semi-expendable items of ₱1,728,688.25; (e) non-derecognition of disposed unserviceable properties amounting to ₱199,024.00 erroneously recorded as Other Assets instead of PPE; and (f) non-recognition as PPE of overhead tank and accumulated major repairs on structures amounting to ₱5,546,830.01 and ₱1,272,739.55, respectively.



For the above noted deficiencies, we recommended and Management agreed to instruct the:



a)			Accounting and Property Sections to prioritize the reconciliation of the results of the inventory count with the supply and accounting records; analyze the reconciling items; and prepare correcting entries, as warranted; and



b)			Agency Accountant to derecognize in the books of accounts those semi-expendable items already consumed/issued to end-users.



	We also recommended and Management agreed to:



a)			Instruct the Accounting and Property Sections to (i) prioritize the updating and reconciliation of Property Cards (PCs) with Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELCs); (ii) analyze the reconciling items; and (iii) prepare correcting entries, if applicable;



b)			Direct the Agency Accountant to (i) reclassify to their proper accounts PPE accounts below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00; (ii) derecognize unserviceable properties with no future economic benefits; (iii) provide for impairment loss for those with recoverable amount; (iv) verify the existence and accuracy of recorded fruit bearing trees and cause their reclassification from  Other Assets to their proper Biological Asset accounts; and (v) derecognize the unserviceable properties already disposed but still included as Other Assets; and



c)			Prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the misstatements in the accounts Buildings and Other Structures and Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) due to failure to treat as asset the cost of Overhead Tank and various construction materials issued aggregating to ₱6,819,569.56 in CYs 2019 and 2020. 





E.  Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



Summarized below are the other significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report.



1.	The accuracy and validity of the items comprising the Deposit on Letters of Credit (DLC) account amounting to ₱516,933,079.92 as at year-end were doubtful due to (a) presence of DLCs of ₱8,314,771.06 not reflected in the bank balance; (b) existence of dormant accounts, aged five to six years, amounting to ₱1,523,206.66; and (c) inclusion of  fully negotiated/utilized DLCs in the sum  of ₱5,048,746.06, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the Financial Statements contrary to Section 15, Chapter 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. Furthermore, the foregoing lapses are inconsistent with the transitory provisions in Item 5.2 of Treasury Circular No. 3-2019 dated May 10, 2019. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 



	(a) 	Accounting Section to reconcile and make a formal inquiry from the bank concerned regarding the unrecorded/non-existent DLCs; and



	(b) 	Planning and Logistics  Division and Accounting Section to (i) continuously coordinate in the immediate review of  the outstanding LCs; (ii) verify the applications of payment; (iii) cause the reversion of  any balances for those LCs already fully delivered/negotiated, without movement or activities, and those that are no longer valid in compliance with Treasury Circular No. 3-2019 dated May 10, 2019; and (iv) effect the necessary adjustments in the books, as applicable for the recorded balances of the Deposit on Letters of Credit account once their status are confirmed with the Banks concerned.



1)		The correctness and validity of the items comprising the Other Receivables account amounting to ₱89,036,236.59 were uncertain due to (a) failure of the Comptroller Division to substantiate with details the transactions and balances of accounts totaling to ₱23,865.47; (b) inadequate provision for impairment on dormant receivables of ₱129,597.12; (c) doubtful collectability of receivables arising from sale of scrap materials through barter in the sum of ₱88,882,774.00 owing to absence of a stipulation on the schedule of settlement/delivery, inconsistent with Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I,  and Section 6 of the Contract to Barter. (Observation No. 6)

	

We recommended and Management agreed to undertake the following remedial measures:



a)		direct the Chief Accountant to exhaust all remedies to determine the details and collectability of the Other Receivables account and exert more diligent effort to collect them. Otherwise, make a request to the Commission on Audit (COA) thru the Office of the Audit Team Leader for the de-recognition/write-off of the dormant, non-moving accounts following the procedures and requirements provided in COA Circular No. 2016-005;

	

b)		establish stricter policies on the collection of accounts, especially on the unpaid utilities of employees using the GA facilities to avoid the accumulation of uncollected Receivables;



c)		work out for the supplementary provision to the Contract to Barter stating the specific duration or timeframe for the delivery of the bartered items to protect the interest of the government; and



d)		require the immediate delivery of the goods exchanged by the second party under the Barter System. In case of continual non-delivery, enforce the necessary sanction as provided for under Section 6 of the Contract to Barter.



2)		 Due to weaknesses in internal control, it has been the customary practice of management to approve disbursements even without complete documentary requirements and benefit of proper procurement process, as exemplified in the purchase of medicines worth ₱569,197.00, inconsistent with the pertinent Sections of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184, R.A. No. 9502 or the Universally Accessibility Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act of 2008, and Administrative Order No. 2016-0034; thus, the principles of transparency and accountability in government transactions were compromised. Likewise, the validity and propriety of the disbursements were uncertain. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and management agreed to:



a)	require the Chief Accountant to (i) ensure the completeness of the supporting documents before the payment of transactions; and (ii) submit to the Auditor’s Office the required documents in compliance with the Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 to facilitate review and verification thereof; 



b)	properly plan the kind of medicines to be procured based on the PNF Manual in accordance with Administrative Order No. 2016-0034 and comply strictly with the policies and procedures prescribed thereto; 



c)	strictly enforce the use of the current DPRI in setting the threshold (ABC) of the medicines to be purchased in consonance with the directives of the Department of Health as per R.A. No. 9502; and 



d)	as an additional control over disbursements, require the supplier to issue the corresponding O.R. for the medicines paid for in compliance with existing BIR Regulations and DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14.





F.  Status of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



As of December 31, 2020, the Agency had no unsettled Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges.





G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Unimplemented Audit Recommendations



Of the 21 audit recommendations contained in the Annual Audit Report (AAR) for CY 2019, six or 29% were fully implemented, eight or 38% were partially implemented and seven or 33% were not implemented at all.
