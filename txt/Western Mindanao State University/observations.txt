PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



FINANCIAL AUDIT



Accounting Errors/Omissions and Deficiencies



1)	Book reconciling items remained unrecorded in the books of accounts as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), thereby understating Cash-in-Bank (CIB) balance by P110.747 million.  



	1)	Section 2, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs defines Bank Reconciliation as settlement of differences contained in the bank statement and cash account in the agency’s/entity’s books of accounts.



	2)	Section 6 further provides:



“Recognition of Adjustments.  The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.”



	3)	This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation. Verification of the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) as of December 31, 2020 showed that book reconciling items amounting to P110.747 million, remained unadjusted despite the previous year’s recommendation to require the officials/employees concerned to look into these reconciling items and ensure that these were properly adjusted. A summary of the aforementioned items is shown below in millions (Please see attached Appendix A for details):

	4)	These reconciling items need to be adjusted immediately to avoid stacking of reconciling items in the future BRS and to present the correct amount of CIB balance as of any given date. 



	5)	The non-recording in the books of reconciling items understated the CIB balance by P110.747 million as of December 31, 2020.



Recommendation



	6)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the Accountant to look into these reconciling items, obtain supporting documents, and prepare the necessary adjusting entries;



b)	Ensure that all reconciling items after the preparation of the BRSs are taken up in the books of accounts in consonance with Section 6, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; and



c)	Call the attention or make representation with the bank concerned about the errors discovered upon receipt of the monthly Bank Statements.



Management Comment



	7)	Management assured the Audit Team that the Cashier Office regularly monitors the deposits made in the Bank accounts. Upon receipt of the Bank Statement, the Accounting Section still has to identify and verify the payees/depositor, since most of the transactions reflected in the Bank Statements are fund transfers and deposits, whose details such as Payee/Agency name, are not provided, unless the Payee/Agency informs the University.



	8)	However, due to the pandemic and the restrictions it brought to all government transactions, there has been considerable delays on the verification of accounts especially on fund transfers and other online deposits made to the bank accounts of the University.



	9)	This has resulted in delayed confirmation from other government agencies of the fund transfer, such as the fund transfer from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) that was confirmed only on February 2021, which is one of the material amounts listed in the reported reconciling items as of December 31, 2020. Hence, issuance of Official Receipts (ORs) was also delayed, as well as the recording in the books of the University.



	10)	Furthermore, most of the reconciling items were already adjusted on January to February 2021. As of May 2021, 97 percent of the reported reconciling items as of December 31, 2020 were already reconciled while the rest of the items are still for verification. Management will provide the necessary documents, such as the journal entries to the Audit Team for proper disclosure of the said reconciling items.



	11)	Notwithstanding the above explanation, the University has currently completed the online enrollment with the Bank which allows real-time and on-time access to the reports generated by the Bank to avoid the same problem in the future.



Non-Recognition of Allowance of Impairment Loss



2)	No Allowance for Impairment Loss was provided for Loans Receivables - Others amounting to P2.154 million whose collectability remains uncertain, contravening Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, thus affecting Management’s assertion on proper valuation of account.



	1)	Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of GAM for NGAs on Impairment of Financial Assets- states:



“An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit.



In case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts.”



	2)	An adjusting journal entry to record the impairment loss is as follows:

	3)	Loans Receivables – Others account pertain to loans granted to students under the Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP) and Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) of the CHED.  A total of P2.347 million student loans were granted.  Of the total amount, only 8.22 per cent, or P193,031.50 was paid from the period of 2004 to 2020, leaving an uncollected balance of P2.154 million as of December 31, 2020. 



	4)	Moreover, analysis of the Loans Receivable account revealed that receivables from SAFE are aged nine to 10 years already for receivables granted in the year 2008 and 2009.  Whereas, Loans Receivables from the StuFAP were outstanding for more than 14 years since 2004. We had recommended to Management to exert effort and send demand letters to have the loan grantees repay their obligations so that other deserving students can avail of the loan privilege to increase the beneficiaries of the SAFE Loan Program. However, according to Management, significant numbers of demand letters were returned due to change of address of student borrowers.



	5)	This is a reiteration of last year’s Annual Audit Report (AAR) finding and Management still did not implement our recommendation to provide for Allowance for Impairment. The non-recognition of impairment loss for receivables whose collectability is doubtful affected the fair presentation of assets and expenses/ equity accounts.



Recommendation



	6)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Assess collectability of all receivables at the end of each reporting period where there is objective evidence that the receivable accounts are impaired and provide an Allowance for Impairment Loss;



b)	Consider requesting for the write-off of dormant receivables or non-moving receivables per COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



Management Comment



	7)	Management will comply with the recommendation. Necessary documentary requirements in accordance with the provision of COA Circular No. 2016-005 relative to the request for write-off of dormant accounts will be prepared by the Accounting Office and will be submitted to COA the soonest possible time.

Non-Writing-Off of Dormant Receivable Accounts



3)	The amount of P0.685 million forming part of Due from NGAs and Due from Local Government Units (LGUs) accounts as of December 31, 2020, has been dormant in the books for more than 10 years and no action was taken by Management to have the amount written off from the books pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides the Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivable Accounts, Unliquidated Cash Advances, and Fund Transfers of NGAs, LGUs, and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs):



“Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers are advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.”



	2)	Shown in the following table is the Agency’s Inter-Agency Receivables as of December 31, 2020 (in millions).

	3)	Interview with the Accountant disclosed that part of the balance of Due from NGAs and Due from LGUs included prior year’s fund transfers amounting to P0.670 million and P14,582.50, respectively, or a total amount of P0.685 million, which remained unliquidated for more than 10 years, in which no details have been provided by the previous administration.



	4)	We noted, however, that despite of having a basis to write-off these accounts as per COA Circular No. 2016-005, Management has not availed of this provision by filing with the competent authority a request for write-off of said dormant accounts.

	5)	The inclusion of these amounts whose collectability could no longer be possible affected Management’s assertion on proper valuation thus affecting the fair presentation of the receivables account in the Financial Statement (FS).



Recommendation



	6)	We recommended that Management file with COA a request for write-off in accordance with the guidelines for dormant accounts provided for under COA Circular 2016-005.



Management Comment



	7)	Management will comply with the recommendation. Necessary documentary requirements in accordance with the provision of COA Circular No. 2016-005, relative to the request for write-off of dormant accounts, will be prepared by the Accounting Office and will be submitted to COA the soonest possible time.

	

	Non-Recording of Completed Infrastructure Projects to its Appropriate Accounts

	

4)	Construction in Progress (CIP) – Buildings & Other Structures/Infrastructure Assets that were already completed and turned over to Management were not reclassified to appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) thereby, overstating the same and understating PPE by P11.964 million.



	1)	Volume III of GAM for NGAs, or the updated Revised Chart of Accounts provides the definition of CIP-Buildings and Other Structures as the accumulated cost or other appropriate value of buildings and other structures which are still in the process of construction or development and to be reclassified to the appropriate PPE account upon completion with recognition of the related depreciation in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS).



	2)	Management submitted to the Office of the Auditor a report regarding the status of infrastructure projects of the Agency including the actions that Management commits to take for on-going projects. It also shows therein the completed and turned-over infrastructure projects. However, upon review of the schedule of CIP account submitted by the Accounting Unit, it was noted that the balance of CIP account still included projects that were already completed and turned-over to Management as shown in the following table.

	

	Projects

	Contract Cost

	Remarks

	Repair/Renovation of Dietary Room

	P       2.219

	Completed & turned over last 08/25/20.

	Rehabilitation of Campus Drainage (Final Phase)

	9.745

	Completed. 

	Total

	P     11.964

	

	

	3)	As a result of the non-reclassification of completed projects, CIP account is overstated and Buildings and Other Structure account is understated by P 11.964 million. Consequently, it also affects the recognition of allowance for depreciation from the time the construction was completed and ready to use or available for occupancy by end-users, thus affecting the fair presentation of the FS. 



Recommendation

	

	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to effect the necessary adjustments in the books transferring completed projects from CIP account to the appropriate PPE account and provide the necessary depreciation.











Issued Semi-Expendable Inventory Recorded as PPE



5)	Books with individual cost of less than the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 were erroneously recorded as PPE thus, overstating PPE and equity accounts, and understating expense by P 11.648 million.



	1)	Section 4, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs states the application of the Capitalization Threshold of P15,000 as criteria for recognition of PPE.  



“The capitalization threshold of P15,000 represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial Position…

xxx

b. This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis.  Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment, will need to meet the capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE.”



	2)	Section 10, Chapter 8 of the same Manual states that items that are below the capitalization threshold shall be recorded as Semi-Expendable property and shall be recognized as expenses upon issuance, transfers, loss or other disposal and adjustments.



	3)	Review of the PPE account disclosed that it included the amount P11.648 million representing procurement of books with individual cost of less than P15,000.00. Under the abovementioned accounting standard, this amount should not have been recorded under PPE account considering that it did not meet the capitalization threshold of P15,000 but instead should have been recorded and classified under Semi-Expendable account. 



	4)	We also noted that despite the inclusion of this under the PPE account, depreciation has not been recognized in the books. We further noted that Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) did not include therein the list of books acquired by the University and accordingly, these books were already issued to end-users. 



	5)	The erroneous entry resulted in the overstatement of PPE account; understatement of expense account considering that the semi-expendable items have already been issued to end users and overstatement of equity account in the amount of P11.648 million.



Recommendation



	6)	We recommended that Management make the necessary adjustments in the books for the erroneous entry and henceforth, ensure that all tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 are appropriately recognized in the books using the Semi-Expandable property account.



Management Comment



	7)	Management will comply with the recommendation. The Accounting Section has been verifying the items under the Book account for reclassification. 



	8)	Furthermore, necessary adjusting entry has been made to reflect the corrections to Semi-Expandable and Equity accounts. Management also assures the Audit Team that the required supporting documents for reclassification shall be complete.



Overstatement of Advances to Contractors Due to Erroneous Adjusting Entries



6)	The Advances to Contractors (AC) account with a balance of P6.142 million as of December 31, 2020, is overstated by P2.102 million, with corresponding understatement of CIP and Government Equity accounts by P4.239 million and P2.137 million, respectively, as a result of erroneous adjusting entries.



	1)	"Annex E” of Contract Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 provides that the procuring entity can make an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding 15 percent of the contract price as mobilization fee, which shall be repaid and deducted from the periodic progress payments.  



	2)	Moreover, Volume III of GAM for NGAs or the updated Revised Chart of Accounts provides that the account Advances to Contractors shall be used to record the amount advanced to contractors as authorized by law and the same shall be credited upon recoupment.



	3)	Review of the schedule of AC account revealed that the AC and CIP balances of some infrastructure projects do not tally with the recomputed AC and CIP balances based on its status of infrastructure projects on the percentage of completion as of year-end. The analysis resulted in the identification of three infrastructure projects that have different balances of AC and CIP as recorded in the books and as when compared to the balances per audit recomputation.



	4)	The following table shows the balances of the three identified projects and its respective accounts recorded in the books as of year-end.

* These percentages were obtained from the latest progress billing paid to contractors as of December 31, 2020.



	5)	From the table above, we have noticed that the Government Equity account has negative balances. Review of journal entries made in prior years revealed that these negative balance were caused by adjusting entries to correct errors made in recording the AC account. To correct the errors, the Accounting Unit had debited the Government Equity account and credited the AC account.



	6)	Moreover, based on the JEVs obtained, it was noted that Management had prepared adjusting entries to correct the balances of CIP, AC and Accounts Payable (AP) as recommended in the Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) issued for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. However, despite previous adjusting entries made to correct and close the AP accounts, as well as the affected CIP account, the latter account still does not reflect the percentage of completion of the projects mentioned above. 



	7)	The table below shows the correct balances that should have been reflected in each infrastructure project had the adjusting entries been complete and correct (in millions). See Appendix B for more details.

                      				        AC = Y x (100%-column 3)



	8)	Comparing the two tables above would result to a difference of the account balances resulting in the overstatement of AC account by P 2.102 million and understatement of CIP and Government Equity accounts by P 4.239 million and P2.137 million, respectively.



Recommendation



	9)	We recommended that Management require the Accounting Unit to analyze carefully and review the entries previously made to come up with the corrected balances of AC and CIP accounts with the following proposed adjusting journal entries: 



Account

Amount (in millions)



Debit

Credit

Construction in Progress

4.239



Advances to Contractors

2.137



Management Comment



	10)	Management will comply with the recommendation. The errors on AC account were caused by the previous practice of the Management to record not yet due and demandable AP on infrastructure projects, which also affected other related account such as the CIP and AC accounts. 



	11)	Nonetheless, necessary adjusting entry has been made to reflect the corrections to AC, CIP, and Government Equity accounts.



Various Errors and Omission in recording of Accounts Payable



7)	The balance of AP presented in the FS amounting to P19.215 million, consisting of P3.025 million and P16.190 million for General Fund (GF) and Special Trust Fund (STF), respectively, as of December 31, 2020, is overstated by P1.427 million due to various errors and omission in the keeping of accounts.



Recognition in the Books of Goods/Services Not Yet Delivered or Activities Not Actually Conducted by P150,386.26.



	1)	Section 2(a), Chapter 6, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs defines AP as valid and legal obligations of NGAs/Operating Units for which goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred.



	2)	Likewise, Section 37, Chapter 2, Volume I of GAM for NGAs states that: 



“No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and unless there is proper authority for its incurrence.”



	3)	As of December 31, 2020, the Agency has a total balance of AP in its books amounting to P19.215 million, consisting of P3.025 million and P16.190 million for the GF and STF, respectively. Verification of these amounts disclosed that some obligations have been recognized as payables even though the goods/ services expected from the supplier/service provider have not been delivered/ rendered as of year-end. Recognition of these obligations as valid payables resulted in the overstatement of AP. The following table shows the breakdown of the said payables.

	4)	It is emphasized that this kind of practice has been one of the recurring subjects in past audit reports. Fortunately, the effects on the practice of recording a transaction which had been obligated at end of the year, regardless of whether goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted or not, has been rectified by the Accounting Unit last April 2020, as had been recommended in last year’s reiteration of observation on the same subject matter. The Accountant mentioned in a verbal interview that these books are partially delivered and that the Accounting Unit have not been notified on the cancellation of the training on Data Privacy Awareness. 



	5)	Analysis of the University’s Report of Checks Issued and GL indicated that while indeed these books were partially delivered in 2020 and 2021, the remaining balance of the originally obligated amount is not a valid obligation, as the goods for these claims have not been delivered to and accepted by the University as of December 31, 2020. Unless the books are delivered to the University, the outstanding obligation balance does not form part of the AP balance at year-end.



Erroneous Posting and Double Recording of AP by P1.277 Million

	

	6)	Chapter 3, Volume III of the Revised Charts of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes:

	

	Account Title

	This account is used to recognize the cost of construction materials purchased/acquired for stock and later issuance for the construction, fabrication, repair and rehabilitation of government facilities undertaken by administration. Credit this account for issuance to projects, transfers, loss or other disposal.

	

	7)	Further analysis revealed erroneous posting of amounts to AP of Life and Retirement Insurance Premiums payable to the GSIS, instead of recording these under the Due to GSIS account. These amounts cover the premiums for personnel who got promoted during the period from July to September 2019.

	8)	Additionally, there are creditors listed twice in the account’s schedule that have the same BURS number. Closer examination of the General Journal and GL showed that the amounts payable to the creditors were entered twice in the books, but each with a different account debited. 



	9)	Further, the account to be debited in Item No. 8 in the table below should be Construction Materials Inventory. The inventories in Item No. 8 refer to construction materials acquired by the University for projects to be undertaken by Administration. At least one of the debited accounts in both occurrence of double posting is incorrect.

	Recommendation

	

	12)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Instruct the Accountant to record only transactions as AP if goods/ services/ projects have been delivered/ rendered/ completed and accepted by the Agency; and



b)	Require the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the overstatement/understatement of AP and other affected accounts.

	

	Management Comment



	13)	Management will comply with the recommendation. Necessary adjusting entry has been made to reflect the corrections to AP and other related accounts. 



	14)	Management also assures the Audit Team that the Accounting Section was instructed to exercise more caution and care in the recording of transactions to avoid similar errors in the future.

	

	Various Errors of Other Payables Account

	

8)	The accuracy of the Other Payables account balance of P56.373 million as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to inclusion of: a) negative balances amounting to P (7.137) million; b) dormant accounts in the amount of P5.543 million; c) amounts erroneously charged to Other Payables account for a total of P24.151 million; and d) accounts without details or schedules and due for remittance to Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) for a total amount of P332,305.19.



	1)	Volume III of the GAM for NGAs prescribes the Revised Chart of Accounts which National Agencies are mandated to use to properly recognize and present their financial transactions. As defined in this Manual, Other Payables, with account number 29999990, is used to recognize other liabilities not falling under any of the specific payable accounts.



	2)	Further, Section 3.2 (b) of COA Circular No. 99-004 dated August 17, 1999 provides among others that unliquidated obligations which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claims, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which has not been covered by perfected contracts on record should be reverted to Cumulative Results of Operations Unappropriated (CROU), now to BTr.



	3)	On the other hand, Subsidiary Ledger (SL) is a book of final entry containing the details or breakdown of the balance of the controlling account appearing in the GL. Posting to SL generally come from the source documents. The totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with their respective control account regularly or at the end of each month. Schedules shall be prepared periodically to support the corresponding controlling GL account.



	4)	For calendar year (CY) ending December 31, 2020, the University reported Other Payables of P24.912 million and P31.461 million for GF and STF, respectively. The schedule of Other Payables account is summarized in Appendix C.



	5)	Review of the account schedule, however, disclosed the following observations.



Inclusion of Negative Balances for a Total Amount of P (7.137) Million



	6)	Some of the accounts for reclassification or adjustment resulted in negative balances.  Details are as follows:

	7)	Accordingly, the negative balances occurred due to error of account code used and posted when remittance was made years back. 



Inclusion of Dormant Accounts for a Total Amount of P 5.543 Million



	8)	Pursuant to existing rules and regulations, dormant accounts which have remained unadjusted and non-moving as of the year-end for the past three to four years or more should be deposited to the BTr.

	9)	According to Management, these balances were not covered by details and they could not trace the source way back in year 2007. The old account of withholding tax for an amount of P1.856 million is a reclassification from the previous chart of accounts. On the other hand, the Tax Remittance amounting to P49,223.08 are taxes withheld from supplier without Tax Remittance Advice. 



	10)	Furthermore, the LBP, PVB and PNB accounts, which have become dormant since 2002, are salary deductions from employees’ loans from previous Administration. According to the Accountant, there are no longer loans currently payable by the Agency to the banks and they are tracing their records to determine the cause of this amount.



	11)	Inclusion of these accounts without support or a valid proof to warrant payment renders the accuracy of the amount presented in the FS doubtful. 



Amounts Erroneously Charged to Other Payables Account for a Total of P24.151 Million



	12)	Among the deficiencies noted in the review of SL are the transactions that were credited to Other Payables account shown in the following table.

	13)	As a result of the erroneous entries, Other Payables account is overstated by P24.151 million and other accounts enumerated above are understated by the amount stated in the above table.  



Accounts Without Details or Schedules and Due for Remittance to BTr for a Total Amount of P332,305.19



	14)	Accounts where schedules or details were not provided to facilitate validation for a total amount of P213,333.15 were carried over from previous Administration. Furthermore, the account includes salary deductions from employees issued with Notice of Disallowance (ND) or Notice of Suspension (NS) which should have been remitted to the BTr.



	15)	Details are as follows:

	16)	In addition to the above observations, it was also noted that the SL of some accounts were not maintained for every creditor/contractor/grantor which makes it difficult to identify the composition and verify the ending balances payable per creditor/contractor/grantor as well as determine validity of claims. Details of these accounts are shown in the table below (in millions).

	17)	As result of the above deficiencies, the account of Other Payables could not be ascertained correctly, thus, the assertions on reliability, existence, valuation and fairness of presentation of this account could not be sufficiently established.



Recommendation



	18)	We recommended that Management require the Accountant to:



a)	Analyze/reclassify or adjust, if necessary, the account pertaining to negative balances if the same are found to be valid;



b)	Exert effort to produce documents to support the dormant accounts and prepare necessary adjusting entries;



c)	Deposit to BTr all account balances that are dormant and which do not have valid claimants as well as those due for remittance such as salary deductions made for the collections of suspensions and disallowances;



d)	Review the accounting entries indicated in the JEVs before posting them in the GL to minimize, if not totally, eliminate the errors in recording and posting of transactions in the book of accounts;



e)	Make necessary reconciliation of the unidentified payables and adjust accordingly; and



f)	Prepare SL for every creditor/contractor/grantor to keep track of the transactions and facilitate reconciliation with the GL and analysis of the accounts.



Management Comment



	19)	Reconciliation of Other Payables account is on-going and the following measures are being taken to comply with the recommendation of the Audit Team:



a)	Preparation of data needed to support the request for write-off of dormant accounts;



b)	Assignment of one Accounting Staff to review the posting of entries and preparation of necessary correcting/adjusting entries, as well as the generation of SL for this account; and



c)	Review of previous transactions to identify the account codes used for a certain transaction and the reasons behind it.

 

	20)	In the case of CHED-Stipend, these are funds received from the CHED-Regional Office (RO) IX, intended for payment of stipend and other allowance to identified beneficiaries of various scholarships and other grants managed by CHED-RO. The Other Payables account is used in recording the transaction since the University is only the temporary custodian of the funds, which are intended for the student beneficiaries.



	21)	Notwithstanding the measures being undertaken by the Accounting Section, Management would like to assure the Audit Team that the amount recognized in the Other Payables account as a whole are accurate and requires only a thorough review of sub-account codes used in the preparation of journal entries. Rest assured that the generation of the SL will be given priority to reflect the proper classification of each sub-accounts.



Incorrect Accounting Treatment for Receipt of Fund Transfers



9)	 Fund transfers from other government agencies aggregating to P99.332 million were debited to Cash-Collecting Officer instead of the CIB – Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) contrary to Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs. 



	1)	Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs entitled The Revised Charts of Accounts (Updated 2015) provides:



Account Title

Cash-Collecting Officers

Account Number

10101010

Normal Balance

Debit 

Description

This account is used to recognize the amount of collections with the Collecting Officers for remittance to the Treasurer of the Philippines (TOP)/ deposit to Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDBs). Credit this account for remittance to the TOP/deposit to AGDBs. 

Account Title

Cash in Bank- Local Currency, Current Account 

Account Number

10102020 

Normal Balance

Description

This account is used to recognize deposits with AGDBs of income received for which the agency has authority to use; trust receipts authorized under specific contracts and agreements; Revolving Fund under specific laws; and credit advices/memos received from the AGDBs. Credit this account for check disbursements and debit advices/memos received from the AGDBs. 



	2)	Verification of the Reports on Collections and Deposits (ROCD) and related bank statements/snapshots revealed fund transfers to the University’s various current accounts from other government agencies during the periods January 2020 to December 2020 aggregating P99.332 million. These transfers were duly issued with ORs by the Cashier and were subsequently recorded in her Cash Receipts Record (CRR) as part of her collections and deposits.



	3)	As defined in the Chart of Accounts, the journal entry should be a direct debit to the CIB - LCCA based in the bank statement/snapshot, with corresponding credit to appropriate account 



	4)	Review of the corresponding journal entries showed that the Accounting Unit treated the transfers as regular collections of the Cashier, debiting Cash Collecting Officer and crediting the corresponding accounts.  As a consequence of this recording and reporting practice, those transfers were deemed to be part of the Cashier’s collections.



	5)	Although in the overall, there is no overstatement nor understatement since all debits to Cash Collecting Officer are eventually credited to the CIB-LCCA, the journal entry prepared is incorrect and does not reflect the actual inter-fund transfer. 



Recommendation



	6)	We recommended that Management direct:



a)	The Cashier not to include as part of her collections fund transfers from other government agencies, instead include/report the ORs issued in the ROCD with a notation/remark that the same was issued for fund transfer directly deposited to the depository bank; and



b)	The Accounting Unit that henceforth, to use the account CIB, LCCA in the recording of cash receipts for fund transfers from other government agencies directly deposited to the depository account.



Management Reply



	7)	Management will comply with the recommendation. The Cashier has been informed and instructed that issued ORs will be notated/remarked as fund transfer directly deposited to the depository bank and not to record such transaction as part of her daily collections.



	8)	Likewise, the Accounting Unit has made the necessary adjustments to reflect the fund transfer of other government agencies directly to depository bank in the books of account of the University.



PRIOR YEAR AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS WITH IMPACT ON THE CURRENT YEAR’S FS



10)	Due to NGAs account amounting to P58.173 million as of December 31, 2020 has not been fully substantiated with SLs, thus, Management’s assertions on reliability and existence of this account could not be fully validated.



	1)	Management had submitted the schedule of Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020 that shows the beginning balance, disbursements, collections and adjustments made for the year 2020 per fund source. The following table below shows the details submitted by Management as of year-end (in millions).

	2)	Aside from the schedule above, Management also submitted details regarding the transactions debited (disbursements and adjustments per NGA for the current year) on the accounts of CHED, PCAARRD and VATF only. However, upon audit recomputation of the total debits, the amount does not tally with the total disbursements and adjustments per fund source as shown in the schedule above.



	3)	Moreover, Management did not submit the SL of this account per NGA as provided in the format prescribed in Appendix 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II, which shows the beginning balance, date of the transaction, particulars, reference, the amount debited and credited, and the ending individual balances of each NGA.



	4)	As a result, further audit procedures to verify the existence and accuracy of Due to NGAs account balance as of year-end could not be performed. Hence, Management’s assertion on the accuracy of the account balance presented in the FS as of December 31, 2020 could not be validated.



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to submit the SL, details and breakdown per NGA or fund source and to analyze, review and work back on the available documents/records of the liabilities to determine the details or breakdown per NGA, and adjust accordingly to reflect the correct balances.



COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Outstanding Cash Advances (CAs) Beyond the Reglementary Period at Year-End Remained Unliquidated



11)	Advances to Officers and Employees and Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) accounts totaling P1.185 million and P58,535.21, respectively, which is due for liquidation remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, affecting the timing of recognition of expenses and relative account.



	1)	Item 3.1.2.1 of COA Circular No. 96-004 dtd. April 19,1996 states that:



“The cash advance for travel shall be liquidated by the official/employee concerned strictly within 30 days after his return to his official station as required under Section 16 of EO 248 as amended otherwise, payment of his salary shall be suspended until he complies therewith.”



	2)	Moreover, Section No. 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997, requires that:



“A CA shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it has been given has been served. All CA shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year, except for petty cash fund, the accountable officer refund any unexpended balance to the cashier/collecting officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.”



	3)	Likewise, Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012 provides that, “...final notice and demand is hereby made to all concerned to settle and liquidate all outstanding cash advances as of December 31, 2011 on or before January 31, 2013.”



	4)	Our audit  shows that out of P1.582 million account balance of Advances to Officers and Employees presented in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, P1.185 million, or 75 percent is due for liquidation in violation of the above cited circular since aging of these advances shows that these have been unliquidated for more than 30 days from the last day of travel. The following table presents the computation of Advances to Officers and Employees account due for liquidation (in millions).

	5)	The data above were obtained from the list of Accountable Officer’s (AOs) with unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 2020 furnished by Management. We noted that the advances due for liquidation amounting to P1.185 million includes prior year balances of P0.755 million, or 64 percent of the total unliquidated balance as of year-end. 



	6)	Further inquiry made on the status of the employees with unliquidated CAs as of year-end disclosed that most of them were no longer connected with the Agency especially those with balances from prior years. Some of those employees already retired, resigned, contract expired or transferred to another Agency. 



	7)	According to Management, they were not able to send out demand letters to employees with unliquidated CAs during the pandemic. Most of the prior year balances are from employees from the previous Administration no longer connected with the Agency, of which the current Administration no longer has information regarding their whereabouts. Employees no longer connected with the Agency do not anymore claim their last salary or take clearance before exit which should have been one of the controls of the Agency to demand liquidation of their CAs.



	8)	However, the Team noted that those with unliquidated advances that are still active with the Agency are with non-moving balances. Only a few of these active employees were imposed sanctions such as monthly deduction from their salary, or voluntary monthly refund.



	9)	On the other hand, details of Advances to SDO account is shown in the following table.

P 58,535.21



	10)	The balance of P2,227.00 transacted on 2007 was the remaining balance mentioned in page 44, Observation No. 4 of 2018 AAR. Based from the table above, the account Advances to SDO is mostly comprised of unliquidated advances for year 2019, with a total of P56,308.21, which is due for liquidation.



	11)	With the above cited observations, the prescribed period of liquidating the CAs to officers and employees for travel and special purposes was not strictly enforced by Management contrary to rules and regulations.



Recommendation



	12)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Impose strict sanctions such as withholding of salaries of officers and employees of any amount due from those currently connected with the Agency; 



b)	Require the SDOs concerned to submit immediately the necessary documents to support the liquidations of CAs granted and return excess advances, if any; and



c)	File a request to the COA for write-off for those accounts which had become dormant and accounts of employees and officers who were separated from the service whose collectability has become remote.



Management Comment



	13)	Management has been issuing regular demand letters to employees with unliquidated CAs. However, for CY 2020, due to the pandemic and the implementation of alternative work arrangement, the issuance of demand letters was put on hold.  Management assured the Audit Team that stricter effort to require the settlement of this unliquidated CAs will be imposed.



	14)	The recommendation to request for write-off of dormant accounts will also be processed by Accounting Section and necessary supporting documents will be submitted to the COA.



Delayed Completion of Infrastructure Projects



12)	Out of 31 infrastructure projects implemented by the University for the years 2018 to 2020, 11 projects with a total contract amount of P137.468 million have not been completed within the term stipulated in the contract and have incurred substantial delays in their completion.

	

	1)	Section 2 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines, states that:



“It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations in the government.”



	2)	One of the primary concerns of the government is that projects be implemented and completed timely so that intended beneficiaries could benefit from them the soonest possible time. 



	3)	For CYs 2018-2020, the University implemented a total of 31 infrastructure projects for a total contract cost of P243.516 million. Appendix D shows the list of infrastructure projects for CY 2018-2020 and the corresponding status of completion per project.

	

	4)	However, based from the Quarterly Report on Government Projects/Programs/Activities (PPA) submitted by the Agency and schedules from Accounting Unit as of December 31, 2020, it was noted that out of the 31 infrastructure projects, only 18 projects were completed and operational, with a total of 13 projects still on-going. Details is shown in the following table.

	5)	For CY 2020, the University implemented four infrastructure projects with a total contract cost of P17.011 million.  Two of these projects were completed within the scheduled time and turned over to Management before the end of the CY 2020. On the other hand, the other two projects are to be completed in the early part of CY 2021. Projects implemented in 2019 are composed of 10 projects contracted with private contractors and four various projects in Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay under Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the DPWH. The projects implemented in CY 2018 were contracted with private contractors as well.

	

	6)	Further review of Quarterly Report on Government PPA submitted by the Agency as of March 31, 2021 revealed that the two projects of CY 2018 that were delayed as of December 31, 2020, are still on-going. Out of the nine projects of CY 2019 that were also delayed as of year-end, four projects under MOA with DPWH have been completed, leaving five projects that were contracted with private contractors still on-going. For the two projects of CY 2020 that are on-going as of year-end, one project has been completed within the first quarter of 2021, leaving one project pending for completion.

	

	7)	As disclosed by Management, abandoned projects will be undertaken by the Administration to its completion and they will assess these projects for the determination of the cost to be incurred for its uncompleted portion. Most of the projects implemented were behind schedule due to limited workers assigned in the construction sites and quarantine status during pandemic period. Management had called the attention of the contractors and accordingly, the contractors are willing to finish the projects along with the payment of penalties for delays. However, these projects have been delayed despite approval of time extension requested.

	

	8)	We also noted inadequate supervision and monitoring of the works of the contractors and proper action on the part of Management to require the contractor to employ remedial measures to hasten the implementation, especially those projects started in CYs 2018 and 2019 that were contracted with private contractors. It is observed in Appendix E that some of the on-going infrastructure projects has increased only a small percentage of completion in a span of one year.

	

	9)	Current circumstances such as Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) have contributed to the delayed completion of the projects, and has deprived the intended beneficiaries of the benefits that could have been derived from the timely completion of the projects. This may also result in idle and insufficient funds to cover the cost of materials for construction due to possible price increases.



Recommendation



	10)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Perform regular supervision and monitoring on the delayed projects to ensure the timely implementation of the projects; and,



b)	Instruct the concerned contractor to fast track or double the accomplishments/ output to cover up the aforementioned delays/negative slippage. Otherwise, consider blacklisting the concerned contractor for future engagements and award the same contract to a qualified contractor through a negotiated contract in accordance with existing rules and regulations.



Management Comment



	11)	Management assured the Audit Team that they have been performing regular supervision and monitoring to accelerate work on the delayed projects. Based on the updated Summary of Delayed/Abandoned Infrastructure Projects as of June 21, 2021, 10 projects were already completed out of 13 projects being implemented from 2018 to 2020, and the other three projects are still on-going.



	12)	In addition, final warnings/notices were issued to the concerned contractors. The observations on the implementation of the projects were constantly communicated to them to ensure that all remaining works are completed at the target date.



13)	COMPLIANCE WITH GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD)



	1)	The University did not maintain its own GAD Database including Sex-Disaggregated Data (SDDs) for use in identifying gender issues and formulating its GAD Plans, Programs and Budget which is not in conformity with Section 36(c) of RA No. 9710 and Section 37.A.1.a of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the same Act.



	2)	Section 36 (c) of RA No. 9710, or the Magna Carta for Women (MCW) provides that all departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, GOCCs, LGUs, and other government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated, and subjected to gender analysis for planning, programming, and policy formulation.



	3)	Moreover, Section 37 A.1(a) of the IRR of the same RA provides that following the conduct of a gender audit, gender analysis, and/or review of SDD, each agency or LGU shall develop its GAD Plans, Programs, and Budget in response to the gender gaps or issues faced by their women and men employees, as well as their clients and constituencies. Along with the Act and these Rules and Regulations, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPGD), the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), among others, shall serve as key documents to guide the identification of gender issues and the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget.



	4)	Additionally, Section 3.2 of Philippine Commission for Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2011-01 defines Gender Analysis as follows:



“Refers to a framework to compare the relative advantages and disadvantages faced by women and men in various spheres of life, including the family, workplace, school, community and political system. It also takes into account how class, age, race, ethnicity, culture, social and other factors interact with gender to produce discriminatory results;”



	5)	For CY 2020, the University had conducted GAD Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) shown in the following table.



Gender Issue

PAPs/Output

Low knowledge and understanding about diverse Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC).

Four SOGIESC trainings conducted among teachers and employees (137 Males and 236 Females).



Organized two advocacy activities to increase awareness and sensitivity on diverse SOGIESC.

Gender Based Violence (GBV) on Campus.

One gender mainstreaming was conducted among the faculty/newly hired employees (256 Female, 145 Male).



Students and faculty/employees participated in the observance of the 18-day campaign against Violence Against Women (VAW).

Sustain research on gender and women studies.

One forum conducted on research proposal among University faculty (21 Females and 4 Males).

Strengthen the partnership with other institutions and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) as partners thru sharing of best GAD practices and enhancement of knowledge and skills in addressing gender issues.

Two local conferences attended were: 

1. The Regional Gender and Development Committee in Pagadian; and

2. The First Scientific Gender Educational Conference for 2020 in Tagum City.



	6)	Interview with the staff of the GAD Focal Point Person disclosed that, while the WMSU Gender Research and Resource Center (GRRC) does collect the sex information of the participants, as indicated in the attendance form in GAD activities, it does not maintain a GAD Database. The number of male and female students/enrollees and University personnel, however, can be obtained at the Office of the Registrar and the Human Resource Management Office, respectively.



	7)	All GAD activities of WMSU, although were related to GAD, were not implemented as a result of gender analysis using a GAD Database. These were formulated through the observation of gender coordinators in each department and actual cases in the workplace/campus. With a data set having only the number of male and female students/enrollees/University personnel, the University cannot identify specific gender issues and ultimately a more concrete GAD Plan, Programs and Budget.



	8)	The above-mentioned provisions in the MCW and its IRR emphasize the importance of SDD in the identification of gender issues and the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget. As such, the University’s SDD should not just be a simple statistic of males and females but must include data regarding the following, among others:



a)	Families and Households

b)	Employment and Livelihood

c)	Education

d)	Health



	9)	Absence of these data in the agency’s SDD may result in unrealistic and unresponsive   gender issues necessary in the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget and ultimately, in addressing discrimination and inequality in the economic, political, civil, social and cultural life of women and men.



	10)	The University included in the CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and subsequently GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) programs for attribution to the GAD Budget. Costs of these programs/projects have been attributed using the Harmonized GAD Guidelines (HGDG) tool during the planning phase. Further, the CY 2020 GPB was reviewed and endorsed by the PCW. 



Recommendation



	11)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Collect SDD regarding families and households, employment and livelihood, education and health thru sending out questionnaires to its employees and students via pen and paper questionnaires or through online surveys/ questionnaires like Google Forms and Survey Monkey; and



b)	Collate the above-mentioned SDD, regularly update and maintain it at the University’s GAD database and use them in analyzing and identifying gender issues in the formulation of GPB.



Management Comment



	12)	Management will comply with the recommendation. For additional information, the GPB and the HGDG tool for the year 2020 has been approved while the revised AR has already been submitted to the PCW, thru CHED, pending for approval. Management assured the Audit Team that they will collect SDDs from employees and students as recommended.



OTHER MANDATORY AUDIT AREAS



14)	COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS RELATED TO SENIOR CITIZENS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITY

d)	Designated walkways in conspicuous locations to ensure safe and smooth flow of pedestrian and vehicles inside the campus; and



e)	Free blood pressure check-up of personnel through the University Clinic. This is particularly helpful for senior citizens as they are at a higher risk from developing complications due to abnormal blood pressure levels.
