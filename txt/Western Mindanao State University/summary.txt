Introduction



The Western Mindanao State University (WMSU) was created under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1427 on June 10, 1978. Its status has been greatly strengthened with the approval of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292 on June 6, 1997 providing for the uniform composition and powers of the governing board of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and placing them under the supervision of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). 



For 2020, WMSU has a total manpower complement of 1,752, consisting of 809 regular faculty and administration personnel, 10 casuals, 329 Contract of Service (COS) faculty and administration personnel, 133 job-order, and 471 visiting lecturers, signifying a decrease of 15 personnel as compared with the previous year of 1,767.



Audit Objective



The objective of the audit conducted is to (a) ascertain the fairness of presentation of the Financial Statements (FS); (b) ascertain the propriety of financial transactions and compliance with prescribed rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. Performance audit was likewise conducted with the objective of informing management where improvement can be instituted in the field of revenues, expenditures and management of resources.



Audit Methodology



The Commission has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit services. However, to meet the evolving developments in public governance and fund management, the results-based approach in audit was incorporated.



Scope of Audit

The audit was consisted of review of operating procedures, evaluation of the University’s programs and projects, interview of concerned University’s officials and employees, verification, reconciliation, confirmation, inspection, and analysis of account, and such other procedures considered necessary. On a test basis, the audit also included review on the propriety of disbursements and other financial transactions.

	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 



We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FS of WMSU for the year then ended December 31, 2020, taking exception to the effects of the following:



1)	Book reconciling items remained unrecorded in the books of accounts as of December 30, 2020, contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), thus understating Cash-in-Bank balance by P110.747 million. 



2)	No Allowance for Impairment Loss was provided for Loans Receivables - Others amounting to P2.154 million whose collectability remains uncertain, contravening Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, thus affecting Management’s assertion on proper valuation of account.  



3)	Construction in Progress (CIP) – Buildings & Other Structures/Infrastructure Assets still included completed and turned over projects to Management thereby, overstating the same and understating Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) by P11.964 million. 



4. The Advances to Contractors (AC) account with a balance of P6.142 million as of December 31, 2020, is overstated by P2.102 million, with corresponding understatement of CIP and Government Equity accounts by P4.239 million and P2.137 million, respectively, as a result of erroneous adjusting entries.



5.  Books with individual cost of less than the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 were erroneously recorded as PPE, thus overstating PPE and equity accounts, and understating expense by P 11.648 million.



1)	The balance of Accounts Payable (AP) presented in the FS amounting to P19.215 million, consisting of P3.025 million and P16.190 million for General Fund (GF) and Special Trust Fund (STF), respectively, as of December 31, 2020 is overstated by P1.427 million due to various errors and omission in the keeping of accounts.



2)	The accuracy of the Other Payables account balance of P56.373 million as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to inclusion of: a) negative balances amounting to P (7.137) million; b) dormant accounts in the amount of P5.543 million; c) amounts erroneously charged to Other Payables account for a total of P24.151 million; and d) accounts without details or schedules and due for remittance to Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) for a total amount of P0.332 million.



3)	Due to NGAs account, amounting to P58.173 million as of December 31, 2020, have not been fully substantiated with Subsidiary Ledgers, thus, assertions on reliability and existence and fairness of presentation of this account could not be fully established.



Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



1)	Advances to Officers and Employees and Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) accounts, totaling P1.185 million and P58,535.21,respectively, which is due for liquidation remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, affecting the timing of recognition of expenses and relative account.



We recommended that Management: a.) Impose strict sanctions such as withholding of salaries of any amount due from those currently connected with the Agency; b.) Require the SDOs concerned to submit immediately the necessary documents to support the liquidations of CAs granted and return excess advances, if any; and c.) File a request to the Commission on Audit (COA) for write-off of accounts which had become dormant and account of employees and officers who were separated from the service whose collectability has become remote.



2)	Out of 31 infrastructure projects implemented by the University for the years 2018 to 2020, 11 projects with a total contract amount of P137.468 million have not been completed within the term stipulated in the contract and have incurred substantial delays in their completion.



We reiterated our recommendation that Management: a.) Perform regular supervision and monitoring on the delayed projects to ensure the timely implementation of projects; and b.) Instruct the concerned contractor to fast track or double the accomplishments/output to cover up the delays/ negative slippages incurred. Otherwise, consider blacklisting the concerned contractor for future engagements and award the same contract to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract in accordance with existing rules and regulations.
