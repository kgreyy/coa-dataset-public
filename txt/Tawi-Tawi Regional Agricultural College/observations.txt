Management Comment: 







Transparency Seal.





“At the beginning of the year, all government 
agencies shall provide their respective assigned SAs and ATLs 
with a list of all on-going government PPA and those that are to be 
implemented during the year. The list shall include the project 
name; implementing unit, office or division if it is not the agency 
as a whole; brief description of the PPA; contractor or supplier, if 
any, mode of procurement; funding source; cost or approved 
budget; project duration including start and completion dates; and 
location. Other information on the PPA may be requested by the 
SA or ATL anytime for audit purposes



“For infrastructure 
projects, a tarpaulin signboard must be suitably framed for outdoor display at the 
project location, and shall be posted as soon as the award has been made. The 
design and format of the tarpaulin, as shown in Annex A of the same circular, 
shall have the following specifications: 

Tarpaulin, white, 8ft x 8ft 
Resolution: 70dpi 
Font: Helvetica 
Font Size: Main Information – 3” 
Sub-information – 1”

“the cost of the public notices referred to 
above shall be charge against the project cost, provided such notices conform to 
the specifications set forth herein.” 

“All expenses incurred in 
violation of this Circular shall be disallowed in audit. Failure of the concerned 
agency or COA officials to comply with any provisions of this Circular shall be 
subject of administrative disciplinary action provided under Section 127 of 



Presidential Decree No. 1445 without prejudice to the filling of a criminal action, 
if warranted by existing laws.” 











Auditor’s Rejoinder:

“that all procurement shall be within the 
approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and 
judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with government fiscal 
discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of 
governmental functions shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). 
For purposes of this IRR, a procurement project shall be considered crucial to the 
efficient discharge of governmental functions if it is required for the day-to-day 
operations or is in pursuit of the principal mandate of the Procuring Entity 
concerned. The APP shall include provisions for foreseeable emergencies based 
on historical records. In the case of Infrastructure Projects, the APP shall 
consider the appropriate timing/phasing of related project activities, such as, 



engineering design and acquisition of right-of-way site or location, to 
reduce/lower project costs.” 

“that No procurement shall be undertaken unless 
it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto. 
The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the 
Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HoPE or second-ranking 
official designated by the HoPE to act on his behalf.”
