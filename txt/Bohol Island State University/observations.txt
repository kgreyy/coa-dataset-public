DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS



Financial Audit



1)	The accuracy of the Inventories account with a year-end balance of ₱45.199 million is unreliable as Bohol Island State University (BISU) Main Campus still carried in its books supplies and materials that were already issued/used/consumed totaling ₱19.321 million. This condition is contrary to Section 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 16, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAS, Volume 1, thereby overstating the Inventories and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts and understating the expenses accounts as at December 31, 2020.



	Section 112 of PD No. 1445 or the Government Accounting Code of the Philippines requires that “Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted and accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.”



	Section 16, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I laid down the procedures in the requisition and issuance of inventory items. For BISU Main Campus, the Supply Officer prepares the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) based on the issued supplies duly supported with approved and properly accomplished Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS).  The RSMI is then submitted monthly to the Accounting Office for the necessary recording of the issued supplies during the period.



	Verification of records disclosed that as at December 31, 2020 the Inventories account as reflected in the financial statements of BISU Main Campus showed a total balance of ₱28,850,561.66, summarized as follows:

In 2017, the Inventories account showed a balance of ₱12,584,343.09  as at year-end. These were allegedly issued to BISU Main Campus personnel but the previous Property/Supply Officer was not able to submit the required RSMI as the RIS pertaining to the utilization of said inventories could no longer be located. Shown in Table 2 is the analysis on the composition of Inventories account balance as at December 31, 2020.

As can be gleaned from Table 2, the  net additions in Calendar Years (CYs) 2018 and 2019 totaling ₱203,168.37 and ₱6,533,574.99, respectively, were also not adjusted even if said inventories were already consumed or issued to various end users. The Property/Supply Office and the Accounting Office explained that they are still on the process of reconciling their records and subsequently, they will prepare the RSMI based on the Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) and Requisition Issue Slips (RIS).



The non-preparation of the RSMI, which should have been the basis of the Accounting Office to record the utilization of the inventory items, did not conform with Section 16, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. The preparation of the RSMI is clearly stipulated in Nos. 8 to 10 of the procedures laid out in the GAM, Volume I, as part of the activities to be performed by a Supply Officer.  This however resulted in the overstatement of the Inventories and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts and the understatement of various expenses accounts.  



We recommended and Management agreed to require the incumbent Supply Officer to coordinate with the previous Supply Officer and with the Accounting Office in locating the Requisition and Issue Slips of various supplies already issued in the previous years. Thereafter, to prepare and submit the RSMI together with the original copy of the RIS to the Accounting Office, as these will be used as bases in preparing  the journal entries to record the supplies and materials issued in accordance with the procedures laid down in Section 16 Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 



The University President committed to coordinate with the previous Supply Officer so that the Inventory balance of ₱12.584 million could be properly accounted by retrieving and/or by reconstructing the documents on the issued inventories to BISU personnel.  On the adjustments to be made pertaining to CYs 2018 to 2020, the Accountant assured the Audit Team to demand from the Supply Officer the RSMI so that the necessary adjustments can be made for the inventories already issued.



2)	The supplies and materials utilized in CYs 2018 and 2019 totaling ₱7.789 million were recorded by the BISU Main Campus as current year’s expenses, instead of recognizing the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), thus overstating the expenses account and understating the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account as at December 31, 2020 by the same amount.



Chapter 2, Section 8 of Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume 1provides:



Sec. 8. Financial Reporting System for the National Government. The financial reporting system of the Philippine government consists of accounting system on accrual basis and budget reporting system on budget basis under the statutory responsibility of the NGAs, Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and the COA, as follows: (emphasis supplied)



Section 2 of the same chapter of GAM Vol. 1 provides the definition of terms specifically as follows;



a)	Accrual Basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accountng records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses. (emphasis supplied)



Analysis of the inventory account balance disclosed that during the year the Accounting Office made adjustments totaling ₱7,788,514.22 on its various inventory accounts, as shown in Table 3.  Further verification of the Journal Entry Vouchers and its supporting documents revealed that Requisition Issue Slips and Inventory Custodian Slips were all dated 2019, thus demonstrating that these inventories were indeed issued to various end users in CY 2019. Summary of prior year’s adjustments in the Inventories account, which were recorded as current year’s expenses, instead of recognizing the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account, are as follows:

Inventories which were already issued/used in the prior year’s should be recognized in the year to which they relate, thus recording it as an expense in the current year overstated the affected expense accounts  and understated the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accounting Office to apply the accrual method of accounting by recording the utilization of the supplies and materials on the period to which they relate.  We also recommended that Management require the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entry by debiting the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account and crediting the appropriate expense accounts to fairly present the financial statements as at year-end.



3)	The reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account totaling ₱639.454 million as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained as the BISU Calape Campus did not provide depreciation on its PPE account costing ₱5.670 million, contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. The non-provision of the related depreciation has an impact on the valuation of the reported assets. Moreover, the understatement of the accumulated depreciation could not be determined due to the unavailability of the dates of acquisition of the said PPEs.



	Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, provides the guidelines on the recognition of depreciation expense, as quoted:



Sec. 27. Depreciation. PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset. 



Review of the trial balances of BISU Calape Campus as at December 31, 2020 showed that depreciation was not provided for the depreciable assets, as summarized in Table 4.

 The non-provision of depreciation for depreciable assets did not conform with the accounting standards prescribed in the GAM and has adversely affected the valuation of the reported assets of the University. The understatement of the related depreciation could not be computed or determined as of the date of audit due to the unavailability of the dates of acquisitions of the said PPEs. 



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Bookkeeper to trace the date of acquisition of the subject PPEs and compute the depreciation based on the estimated life of the assets using Section 27(f) of the GAM, Volume 1 as a guide.  Thereafter, prepare the necessary journal entries to take up the depreciation expenses for the current year and record the related accumulated depreciation accounts and the adjustments in the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account for prior years’ depreciation expenses. 



4)	The Other Payables account with a year-end balance of ₱63.066 million is doubtful due to the presence of several abnormal negative balances aggregating ₱1.782 million in BISU Candijay Campus.  

	

		Analysis of the Other Payables account in the General Fund (GF) books of BISU Candijay Campus showed that it included abnormal negative balances aggregating ₱1,782,483.95, as follows.

Inquiry with the Bookkeeper revealed that this condition had already been existing from the time she assumed Office, thus she is having difficulty in identifying the cause of the negative balances. 



The existence of negative balances in the liability account of the Campus casts doubt on the validity and reliability of the related payable account.



Also, various collections of the BISU Candijay Campus totaling ₱3,028,504.86 as of December 31, 2020 which remained in the GF and were not transferred to the Special Trust Fund (STF) even though these are receipts accruing to the latter, with breakdown as follows:

Upon checking on the composition of the Other Payables account in the General Fund, it appears that collections aggregating ₱3,028,504.86 should accrue to the STF. However, it remained in the General Fund books and were not transferred to the STF as of reporting date. Failure to transfer said collections to the STF understates the appropriate income and trust liability accounts in the said fund.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Bookkeeper to:



--	exert effort in the evaluation and verification of the negative balances and accordingly, prepare the necessary adjustments;



--	examine thoroughly the composition of the Other Payables account.  Thereafter, any receipts/collections recorded in the GF as Other Payables but accruing to other funds should be transferred immediately.    

	

5)	The Receivable account with a balance of ₱25.969 million as at year-end is unreliable due to: a) non-recognition of receivables from some BISU Candijay Campus personnel,  for the products which were sold on account, from their Income Generating Projects (IGPs), resulting in the abnormal negative balance of ₱0.439 million in the AR account; and b) non-provision of Allowance for Impairment on the Accounts Receivable (AR) of BISU Candijay, Balilihan Campuses, and also for the Loans Receivable account of BISU Main, and Bilar Campuses.



Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, Volume I prescribe the manner in which the general-purpose financial statements should be prepared and presented.  Section 7 thereof pertains to the fair presentation of the financial statements, as quoted on the next page:



“Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. “



Likewise, paragraph 2, Section 111, Chapter 2 of P.D. No. 1445, provides:



“(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.”



	Analysis of the Receivable account of the BISU disclosed a total balance of ₱25,969,057.74 as at December 31, 2020 and we noted the following deficiencies which affected the reliability of the account balance as at year-end: 



a)	Non-recognition of receivables from some BISU Candijay Campus personnel for the products, which were sold on account, from their Income Generating Projects (IGPs), resulting in abnormal negative balance totaling ₱0.439 million.



		Republic Act No. 8292 or the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997” specifically provides the powers and duties of the Governing Boards of the State Universities and Colleges (SUCs).   Section 4 (d) of said Act provides: 

		

		“(d) to fix the tuition fees and other necessary school charges, such as but not limited to matriculation fees, graduation fees and laboratory fees, as their respective boards may deem proper to improve after due consultation with the involved sectors.

		

		Such fees and charges, including government subsidies and other income generated by the university or college, shall constitute special trust funds and shall be deposited in any authorized government depository bank and all interests shall accrue therefrom shall part of the same fund for the use of the university or college. Provided, That income derived from university hospitals shall be exclusively earmarked for the operating expenses of the hospitals.

		

		Any provision of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college. Provided, That all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” (emphasis supplied)



Based on RA 8292, IGPs were undertaken by the management of BISU Candijay Campus in order to generate additional revenue.  Table 7 shows the composition of Accounts Receivable of BISU Candijay Campus as of December 31, 2020.

₱     154,694.82



As gleaned from Table 7, it shows that the subsidiary records for accounts receivable of 92 campus personnel have negative balances totaling ₱439,406.32. Inquiry with the bookkeeper revealed that the negative balances of the creditors from the IGP cannot be construed as overpayments. The bookkeeper further explained that these were payments made through payroll deductions by several Campus personnel, for their account in the IGPs, which were recorded as credit to Accounts Receivable even if the receivable account for the corresponding amount due were not previously recognized.



 It was learned that the Accounting Unit would set-up an Accounts Receivable account once the Business Affairs Office of the IGP submits a Personnel Credit Report which listed the IGP sales on account from several personnel of the Campus. However, in prior years, there were instances when the Business Affairs coordinator would submit the Credit Report directly to the payroll maker to effect the salary deduction from each personnel.  The Accounting Office was not furnished with copies of said reports, thus payments made through payroll deductions were recorded as credit to Accounts Receivable even if the amount due from its personnel were not previously set-up. Hence, it resulted   in abnormal negative balances on the subsidiary records/accounts of several personnel aggregating ₱439,406.32.





We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Business Affairs coordinator to ensure that both the Accounting Unit and the Cash Division be furnished monthly with a copy of the personnel credit report.  Also, we recommended that Management direct the Bookkeeper to request for copy of the prior years’ personnel credit report from the Business Affairs coordinator and thereafter, cause the reconciliation of the accounts receivable account.



The bookkeeper informed the Audit Team that she is currently in the process of reconciling the Accounts Receivable account.



b.1     The AR accounts of the BISU Candijay and Balilihan Campuses with year- end balances of ₱0.155 million and ₱0.370 million, respectively, were not provided with Allowance for Impairment. This condition is contrary to Section 9, Chapter 5 and Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Items 5.4 and 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. Thus, the AR account balance was not stated at its estimated realizable value as at reporting date.



Chapter 5, Section 9 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume I provides that:



Sec. 9. Impairment Losses and Allowance for Impairment Losses. When an uncertainty arises about the collectability of an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount, or the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognized as an expense (impairment losses), rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized.



Entities shall evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis based on historical bad debts, customer/recipient credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in payment activity. An allowance is provided for known and estimated bad debts.



Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, sets forth the regulations on Impairment of Financial Assets as follows:



	“An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through the use of an allowance account. The amount of loss shall be recognized in the surplus or deficit.

		

	In case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of factors such as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences, and identified doubtful accounts”. (Emphasis Supplied)	

	

Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 defines dormant receivable account as follows:



Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



Also, Item 6.1 of the same Circular states that:



	All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose.



	From Table 7 it can be observed that there are receivables of BISU Candijay Campus that are considered doubtful since these are receivables from officers and employees who are no longer connected with the agency due to retirement or separation from the service, hence collection may already be remote. 



Likewise, the Accounts Receivable account in the STF of BISU Balilihan Campus totaling ₱370,242.60 disclosed the following summary, with details in Annex A.

Verification of the details of AR account of the Campus disclosed that these are unpaid tuition fees from students which are already past due and other accounts have been   in the books for over ten years, thus, could be considered as dormant.  No demand letters or other appropriate actions were done by Management to collect the said unpaid school fees nor conducted evaluation if there are possibilities of collections.  



With the prevailing conditions of the AR accounts in the two BISU Campuses, it can be reasonably concluded that the Accounts Receivable balance as at December 31, 2020 was not stated at its estimated realizable value since no Allowance for Impairment was set up.



b.2   Loans Receivable of BISU Main and Bilar Campuses totaling ₱141,800.00 and ₱29,170.00, respectively, were considered dormant pursuant to Item 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, and were also not provided with Allowance for Impairment contrary to Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM, Volume 1.



Review of the Loans Receivable account of the General Fund of BISU Main and Bilar Campus disclosed year-end balances of ₱141,800.00 and ₱29,170.00, respectively, with details in Annex B: 



It was learned that the aforementioned receivable balances are non-moving for over ten years already and the nature of the accounts are unknown and no allowance for impairment was provided on the account contrary to Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM. 



Inquiry with the bookkeepers revealed that no other document can be found to support other than the schedule as shown in the attached Annex B.  There was no proper disclosure or information on the nature of the loans and its status, as well as the probability that payment thereof may still be collected. 



In the absence of any supporting documents and considering that the receivables have been dormant for several years, it appears that the collectability of the receivables are considered doubtful.



	



For observations b.1 and b.2, we recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Bookkeepers to provide an Allowance for Impairment of the Accounts Receivable account based on their objective assessment in the collectability of the account pursuant to the provisions of Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM, Volume I. If despite exhaustive effort, still Management fails to collect the receivables, consider requesting for authority from the Commission on Audit to write-off the dormant receivables that are deemed uncollectible, in accordance with the conditions prescribed in COA Circular No. 2016-005.



Management commented that they will be issuing demand letters for those with outstanding balances with the University.  If in their assessment, the collectability of receivables is very low, they will be considering the option of writing off the receivables. 



For BISU Main Campus, the Campus Director commented that they are currently coordinating with the Registrar to send out demand letters to the concerned students. If collection is not possible, they are considering writing off the receivable in accordance with the conditions set forth in COA Circular No. 2016-005.

	

6)		The balances of reciprocal accounts, Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds accounts, of BISU Calape Campus showed a variance of ₱0.331 million, thereby, casting doubt on the correctness and reliability of the balances of the said accounts.

	

Section 111 (2) of PD No. 1445 on the keeping of accounts provides that the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard inaccurate or misleading information.

	

		The GAM for NGAS, Volume III provides the descriptions of the following reciprocal accounts: 

	

	Account Title

	Description

	Due from Other Funds

	

	This account is used to recognize transfers to other funds and/or receivables from other funds of the agency. Credit this account for payment/liquidation/adjustments.

	

	Due to Other Funds

	This account is used to recognize transfers from other funds and/or payables to other funds of the agency. Debit this account for liquidation of funds received or settlement of liabilities or adjustments.

	

		Receivables and liabilities from/to other funds and the corresponding receipt of amount due for settlement of liability/obligations and other adjustments are taken up in the books using the aforementioned reciprocal accounts. As such, the balances of these accounts at any period should always be equal. 

	

		Verification of the trial balances of BISU Calape Campus as of December 31, 2020 showed that the Due from Other Funds account showed a difference of ₱330,714.26 with details as follows:

	₱ 21,824.19

	₱ 330,714.26

	

The bookkeeper could not provide any information on the nature of the two accounts. Consequently, the existence of unreconciled difference between the accounts Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds, has rendered the accuracy and correctness of these reciprocal accounts doubtful. This condition could lead to inaccurate or misleading information to the users of the financial statements.

	

		We recommended and Management agreed to require the Bookkeeper to trace/locate relevant documents necessary in the verification of the reciprocal accounts.  Thereafter, conduct reconciliation of these reciprocal accounts, and prepare the adjustments, if warranted. 

	

7)		Unclaimed stale checks of BISU Bilar Campus totaling ₱0.421 million  were not restored to the Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) and the liability accounts as at December 31, 2020, contrary to what is required under the provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, resulting in the understatement of the affected accounts.



The Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provide the guidelines on the accounting for cancelled checks when they become stale, voided or spoiled, quoted as follows: 



Section

Provision

Sec. 44, Chapter 6. Accounting for Cancelled Checks.

Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled.  The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed.



A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows:



a)	Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI.



b)	New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit.  A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared to take up the  cancellation. The replacement check shall  be reported in the RCI.



Sec. 56, Chapter 19. Adjustments for Unreleased Commercial Checks

	A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the restoration of the unreleased check to the cash account shall be a debit to “Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current” account with credit to the appropriate liability account. There shall be no physical cancellation of the checks. Xxxx…” Emphasis supplied



The monthly trial balance of BISU Bilar reported Cash in Bank – LCCA balance of ₱58,704,776.19 in the General Fund and ₱129,889,672.08 in the Special Trust Fund as of December 31, 2020. Verification of the outstanding checks listed as reconciling items in the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) showed that ₱76,639.25 in the General Fund and ₱344,842.55 in the Special Trust Fund or a total of ₱421,481.80 were unreleased or unclaimed and already stale as at December 31, 2020, as shown in Annexes C and D.



As required under the above quoted provisions of the GAM, the amount representing unreleased checks should be restored to the Cash in Bank and liability accounts in order to reflect the correct balances of the accounts as at a given period Likewise, the amount of stale checks should be treated similarly as the checks could no longer be negotiated. The non-restoration of the amount of stale checks resulted in the understatement of the cash in bank and payable accounts by ₱421,481.80.  



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Cashier to submit to the Accounting Division the List of Unreleased Checks to provide the Bookkeeper with a basis in reverting to the proper cash and liability accounts the corresponding amount of unreleased/unclaimed stale checks to comply with the provisions of the GAM and to reflect the correct account balances in the financial statements as at year-end.



The bookkeepers assured the Audit Team that they will coordinate with their respective Cashiers on the status of checks that have become stale.  Thereafter, appropriate adjustment entries will be prepared.



Compliance Audit



8)	BISU Balilihan, Calape and Candijay Campuses still failed to revert the unutilized cash allocation of ₱23.862 million in the General Fund books to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) as at December 31, 2020, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990 and DBM National Budget Circulars which prescribe the guidelines on the release of funds for the year. Such practice deprived the government of maximizing the use of the unutilized funds for other relevant undertakings.



BISU is among the agencies of the National Government receiving budgetary support from the National Government. The BISU Main Campus receives its Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for all the campuses through its MDS account in the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Subsequently, upon the receipt of NCA in the University’s MDS account, the main campus transfers the funds to its satellite campuses through their General Fund’s Local Currency, Current Account. 



	The Subsidy received by BISU from the National Government for CY 2020 amounted to ₱334,874,227.00.  The cash allocation of ₱329,426,634.00 for the regular operating expenditures were immediately transferred to the General Fund’s  Local Currency, Current Account of the six BISU Campuses upon receipt of the NCA through the University’s MDS account.   Summary of the funds that were transferred to the Local Currency, Current Account of BISU Campuses, are as follows:



Table 10-  Transfer of Funds to External Campuses

Campus

Amount Transferred (₱)

BISU Main Campus

159,031,155.00

BISU Balilihan Campus

BISU Bilar Campus

42,690,154.00

BISU Clarin Campus

28,990,412.00

Total

329,426,634.00



From the books of the Main Campus, at the time of the transfer of funds to the Campuses’ current accounts, it appears that all MDS funds have been obligated but actually it is only a mere transfer of funds from MDS account to the current accounts of the six Campuses and not as disbursements for incurrence of obligations.   



It is worthy to note that BISU Main, Bilar and Clarin Campuses already remitted the unutilized funds totaling ₱281,532,092.30  to the Bureau of the Treasury.

However, BISU Balilihan, Calape and Candijay Campuses still failed to revert the unutilized cash allocation in the General Fund to the Bureau of Treasury.  Table 11 shows the Cash in Bank balances and the corresponding liabilities of the General Fund as at December 31, 2020 for the three BISU Campuses.

It appears that the cash balance in the General Fund included the unutilized or unencumbered cash balances of prior years. There were also no documents to show that there are obligations for the University’s programs, projects and activities that have been earmarked from the said funds. 



This is not only contrary to COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990 and DBM National Budget Circular No. 577 dated May 2, 2019 but also deprived the government of maximizing the use of the unutilized/unencumbered funds for other relevant undertakings.



 COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990 provides the accounting guidelines and procedures in the implementation of the Modified Disbursement System (MDS).  This covers all funds appropriated in the General Appropriations Act (GAA).  



4.0

Guidelines



4.11

Refunds of cash advances and overpayments shall be remitted to the National Treasury by Offices receiving the Notice of Allocation (NOA) directly from DBM.





4.12

Any balance of deposits per books of the Provincial Offices/ Operating Units corresponding to the unobligated allotment at the end of the year, shall be withdrawn for remittance to the National Treasury and covered by a remittance advice.  In case the unobligated allotment is not backed up by cash, no such withdrawal shall be made.





4.13

Balance of NOA at the end of the year shall automatically expire and shall no longer be valid for use in the ensuing year.



On the other hand, DBM National Budget Circular No. 577 dated May 2, 2019 provides:





3.1

….



3.2

All appropriations authorized under the FY 2019 GAA, as well as programmed automatic appropriations shall be valid for release and obligation for the purpose specified until December 31, 2019.  This validity shall be subject to the pertinent Special and General Provisions of said GAA, the President’s Veto Message on the implementation of cash budgeting, as well as other pertinent laws.



Moreover, Item 3.4.1 of DBM National Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 prescribes the guidelines on the release of funds for FY 2020, which states that:



3.4.1  	The appropriations for the following items under the FY 2020 GAA shall be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020:



	3.4.1.1  Infrastructure Capital Outlays (CO), including subsidy releases to GOCCs for infrastructure projects: and



	3.4.1.2  MOOE and other CO items



Similar guidelines were also issued by DBM on the release of funds from the General Appropriation Act corresponding to the fiscal year.



From an auditor’s point of view, it appears that the practice was done to circumvent the lapsing of funds.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Budget Officers and the Bookkeepers of BISU Balilihan, Calape and Candijay Campuses to prepare a statement of unutilized funds as of December 31, 2020 and every year thereafter. We also recommended that the Bookkeepers prepare the disbursement voucher for the remittance of the unutilized/unencumbered funds to the Bureau of Treasury in compliance with COA Circular No. 90-326 and the appropriate DBM National Budget Circulars.  



9)	The Purchase Orders of the BISU Balilihan, Calape, Candijay and Clarin Campuses on the procurements of goods/services aggregating ₱12.962 million were not properly/completely accomplished, contrary to the instructions specified under Appendix 61 of the GAM for National Government Agencies. Hence, the risk that non-compliance with the terms and conditions in the procurement, if any, may not be promptly determined.

  

As defined in GAM Volume II, “Purchase Order (PO) is a form/document used by the agency/entity, addressed to a supplier, to deliver specific quantities of supplies/goods/property subject to the terms and conditions contained in the PO.” Appendix 61 thereof, provides the prescribed format of the PO as well as the instructions on how to accomplish it.

	

		Verification of the issued POs of BISU Balilihan, Calape, Candijay and Clarin Campuses on the procurements of goods revealed that the POs of several supplies and materials totaling ₱12,962,031.71 were not properly and completely filled-out.  Some of the data such as the Place of Delivery, Date of Delivery, Delivery Term, Payment Term and date of receipt by the supplier on the PO were not indicated.  Said data are necessary in determining whether the goods procured by the Campus were delivered in accordance with the timeline and within the agreed specifications. Shown in Annex E are samples of Purchase Orders with incomplete data.

	

		These data are important because it determines the full responsibility of the supplier on the compliance with the terms in the delivery of the procured goods.  Absence of such would hinder management in determining the deficiency/violation on the stipulations of the PO/contract, if any, and to implement the right action and /or penalties that may be imposed in accordance with existing rules and regulations.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned personnel to properly and completely accomplish the Purchase Order form, by providing all the data as required in Appendix 61 of the GAM, Volume II, in order to facilitate determination of compliance, by both parties, on the terms of the procurement.   



10)	Refunds of various disallowances and overpayment of salaries of BISU Candijay Campus, which were charged against the General Fund aggregating ₱1.344 million as of December 31, 2020, were not remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to the provisions of Section 4 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465, the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 and Section 4.1.1 of COA Circular No. 90-226 dated February 22, 1990.



Section 4 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 provides that:



“As a general rule, all fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or  revenues collected by departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated functions, at such rates as are now or may be approved by the appropriate approving authority shall be deposited to the National Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. No. 292, s. 1987 and Section 65 of P.D. No. 1445.”



Likewise, Section 4.11 of COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990 which provide the accounting guidelines and procedures in the implementation of the Modified Disbursement System (MDS) states that “Refunds of cash advances and overpayments shall be remitted to the National Treasury by Offices receiving the Notice of Allocation (NOA) directly from DBM.”



The composition of the Other Payables account of BISU Candijay Campus as of December 31, 2020 included payments from Campus employees for the payment of disallowances, overpayment of salaries and others, details are shown in Table 12.

Total

₱  1,344,942.83    



 The above refunds aggregating ₱1,344,942.83 were settlements of the notices of disallowance issued on the expenses which were charged against the General Fund.   These payments were made through salary deductions but were recorded in the General Fund books as Other Payables.  



The non-remittance of the total amount, deprived the national government from utilizing the unremitted collections for other relevant undertakings.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Bookkeeper to prepare the disbursement voucher and its supporting documents on the settlement of disallowed expenses, which were charged against the General Fund, for remittance to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr).  Henceforth, all refunds and/or payments due to the BTr shall be immediately remitted/deposited through the account of the National Treasury.



11)	The Management of BISU Candijay Campus failed to enforce collection of the receivables aggregating ₱594,101.24 from its Campus personnel for the IGP products which were sold on account.  Such circumstance is not only contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445 but may also defeat the objective of the project that is to augment the resources/income of the Campus.



Section 2 of P. D. No. 1445, also known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines specified the responsibilities of agency officials, to wit:



Section 2.  “Declaration of Policy. -  It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.  The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rest directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.” (Emphasis/Underscoring Supplied)



	As presented in Table 7, page 10 of the herein report,  it shows that receivables from BISU Candijay personnel aggregated ₱594,101.14.  It was further learned from the Bookkeeper that there was no standing policy as to the terms and conditions of the sale on account to its Campus personnel. Payments were only done through payroll deduction after a verbal permission has been obtained on the deduction from the salaries of the concerned personnel.  Also, there was no demand initiated by the Campus to collect the corresponding amount due from its officers and employees. 



		Failure of management to collect the receivables from their employees is grossly disadvantageous to the Campus.   Also, the absence of policies, guidelines and controls in the operation of the IGP may result in the non-attainment of its objective which is to augment the resources/income of the Campus.



We recommended and Management agreed to enforce efficient collection strategy, and to institute appropriate action against delinquent Campus personnel.  

	 

12)	The approved fidelity bonds of the Cashiers of BISU Balilihan, Clarin, and Main Campuses were insufficient to cover their average monthly accountability. Also, the designated Petty cash Custodian of BISU Main Campus was not properly bonded. These conditions are contrary to Section 101(2) of PD No. 1445 and Section 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009. 



Section 101 of PD No. 1445 known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines provides that:



    1. Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law. 



    2. Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law. 



Sections 4.8 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 known as the Revised Omnibus Regulations Governing the Fidelity Bonding of Accountable Public Officers states that the Fidelity Fund shall be available for the purpose of replacing defalcations, shortages, unrelieved losses in the accounts of bonded public officers, for the payment of fees and costs incident to civil proceedings brought against them to recover sums paid on their account from said Fund (Sec. 326, PBL).

 

–Section 5.1 on the other hand provides that the amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability (cash. property and accountable forms) of the accountable public officer as determined by the Head of Agency. Provided, the individual maximum accountability of each accountable public officer shall not exceed One Hundred Million Pesos (P1OOM). However, the Head of Agency may assign to other public officers the excess accountability for which a separate Fidelity Bond shall be secured.” Emphasis ours



Analysis of the cash and accounts of the accountable officer of BISU Balilihan, Clarin and Main Campuses disclosed that the approved amount of fidelity bonds was inadequate compared to the amount of their average monthly cash accountability. 



Based on the Revised Schedule of Premium Rates issued by the Bureau of Treasury, the bond amount covering the maximum cash accountability is shown in the table below.

Examination of the accountable officers’ accountabilities for the last 12 months revealed that their maximum cash accountabilities as covered by their respective bonds were below their actual monthly average cash collections and advances. Details of their cash accountabilities and amount of approved fidelity bonds are shown in Annex F.



Furthermore, records show that the Administrative Officer V of BISU Main Campus was designated as Petty Cash Custodian.  The initial Petty Cash Fund (PCF) was granted on January 21, 2019 in the amount of ₱20,000.00.  To date, the designated PCF custodian has an increased accountability of ₱50,000.00. Inquiry about the fidelity bond revealed that the PCF Custodian was not bonded ever since  in violation of Section 101(2) of PD No. 1445 and Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009.



It is to be emphasized that one of the documentary requirements for the establishment of PCF as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, amended by COA Circular 2013-001 dated January 10, 2013, is the approved application for bond and/or Fidelity Bond during the year for cash accountability of ₱5,001 or more. 



The inadequacy of the bond of the Campus Cashier and the failure to secure the required bond for the PCF Custodian exposed the Campus to the risk of not being sufficiently indemnified in case of loss of government funds due to unforeseen events, theft or robbery.



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that the accountable officers, whose duties involve the custody of government funds and properties, be properly bonded with amount sufficient to cover their accountabilities in accordance with Section 101(2) of PD No. 1445 and Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009. 



13)	The accountability for accountable forms cannot be easily established due to the non-preparation of the Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) by the Cashier of BISU Main Campus contrary to Section 17(k), Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



Section 17 (k), Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I for NGAs provides:



“Sec. 17. Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained. The following records, forms and reports are prescribed for use:



k. Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) (Appendix 67) – shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer to report on the movement and status of accountable forms in his/her possession. The accountable forms include those with or without face value.”



Correspondingly, Appendix 67 of GAM Volume II instructs that the accountable officer reports the result of the physical count of all accountable forms with or without face value in their custody in the RAAF. Said report shall be prepared monthly and by fund cluster and a copy of which is to be submitted to the Commission on Audit.



It was observed that the Cashier of BISU Main Campus did not prepare the Monthly RAAF.  Only a logbook has been maintained to record the receipt of accountable forms. The accountability for accountable forms of the Cashier could not be easily established or determined, thus may affect the proper monitoring thereof.  Also, the non-preparation of said monthly report does not conform with Section 17(k), Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I for NGAs.

	 	



We recommended and Management agreed to  instruct  the Cashier to prepare and submit the monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms to the COA Audit Team in accordance with the prescribed form under Appendix 67 of GAM Volume II.



COVID-19 Audit



	In June 30, 2020, BISU Main Campus received funding from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in the amount of ₱803,460.00 for the construction and installation of isolation tents for identified recipients who played significant roles in the community as the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic continues.  Said tents will be beneficial to Persons Under Investigation (PUI) and Persons Under Monitoring (PUM) with COVID-19 cases and who are in home isolation or in quarantine centers in the Province of Bohol. This is also in response to Proclamation No. 922 dated March 8, 2020 which enjoins all government agencies to render full assistance and cooperation and mobilize necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat.



	The fund was fully utilized in accordance with the line-item budget as agreed in the Memorandum of Agreement between CHED and BISU and was able to produce a total of 62 isolation tents. These were transferred to the following recipients through donation:

Gender and Development



The University’s GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020 with a budget of ₱1,174,000.00 was submitted to PCW, however, the amount allocated for GAD was only 0.37 percent of the total agency budget appropriations of ₱319,682,400.00, thus still below the mandated requirement of at least five percent of the agency’s approved budget for the year. The GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 is still in the process of consolidation by the GAD focal person as of May 15, 2021.
