E)		 SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the BISU for CY 2020. The objectives of the audit were primarily to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.  On a test basis, it also included a review on the propriety of disbursements and other financial transactions to determine whether or not the transactions were made in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations.  





F)		INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



The Auditor expressed a qualified opinion on the financial statements of the University due to the various audit exceptions, as follows:



1)	The accuracy of the Inventories account with a year-end balance of ₱45.199 million is unreliable as BISU Main Campus still carried in its books supplies and materials that were already issued/used/consumed totaling ₱19.321 million. This condition is contrary to Section 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 16, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAS, Volume 1, thereby overstating the Inventories and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts and understating the expenses accounts as at December 31, 2020.



2)	The supplies and materials utilized in CYs 2018 and 2019 totaling ₱7.789 million were recorded by the BISU Main Campus as current year’s expenses, instead of recognizing the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), thus overstating the expenses account and understating the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account as at December 31, 2020 by the same amount.



3)	The reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account totaling ₱639.454 million as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained as the BISU Calape Campus did not provide depreciation on its PPE account costing ₱5.670 million, contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. The non-provision of the related depreciation has an impact on the valuation of the reported assets. Moreover, the understatement on the accumulated depreciation could not be determined due to the unavailability of the dates of acquisition of the said PPEs.

4)	The Other Payables account with a year-end balance of ₱63.066 million is doubtful due to the presence of several abnormal negative balances in the books of BISU Candijay Campus aggregating ₱1.782 million.



5)	The Receivable account with a balance of ₱25.969 million as at year-end is unreliable due to: a) non-recognition of receivables from some BISU Candijay Campus personnel, for the products which were sold on account from their Income Generating Projects (IGPs), resulting in the abnormal negative balance of ₱0.439 million in the AR account; and b) non-provision of Allowance for Impairment on the Accounts Receivable (AR) of BISU Candijay, Balilihan Campuses, and also for the Loans Receivable account of BISU Main, and Bilar Campuses.

	

	

G)		OTHER SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



In addition, the following are the significant observations and recommendations in the audit and/or evaluation of the operations of BISU for CY 2020. These and other audit observations are fully discussed in Part II of this Report:



1)	BISU Balilihan, Calape and Candijay Campuses still failed to revert the unutilized cash allocation of ₱23.862 million in the General Fund books to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) as at December 31, 2020, contrary to the provisions of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990 and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) National Budget Circulars which prescribe the guidelines on the release of funds for the year. Such practice deprived the government of maximizing the use of the unutilized funds for other relevant undertakings.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Budget Officers and the Bookkeepers of BISU Balilihan, Calape and Candijay Campuses to prepare a statement of unutilized funds as of December 31, 2020 and every year thereafter. We also recommended that the Bookkeepers prepare the disbursement voucher for the remittance of the unutilized/unencumbered funds to the Bureau of Treasury in compliance with COA Circular No. 90-326 and the appropriate DBM National Budget Circulars.  



2)	Refunds of various disallowances and overpayment of salaries of BISU Candijay Campus, which were charged against the General Fund aggregating ₱1.344 million as of December 31, 2020, were not remitted to the Bureau of Treasury contrary to the provisions of Section 4 of the General Provisions of R.A No. 11465, the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 and Section 4.1.1 of COA Circular No. 90-226 dated February 22, 1990.







We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Bookkeeper to prepare the disbursement voucher and its supporting documents on the settlement of disallowed expenses, which were charged against the General Fund, for remittance to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr).  Henceforth, all refunds and/or payments due to the BTr shall be immediately remitted/deposited through the account of the National Treasury.



3)	The Management of BISU Candijay Campus failed to enforce collection on the receivables aggregating ₱0.594 million from its Campus personnel for the IGP products which were sold on account.  Such circumstance is not only contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445 but may also defeat the objective of the project that is to augment the resources/income of the Campus.



We recommended and Management agreed to enforce efficient collection strategy, and to institute appropriate action against delinquent Campus personnel.
