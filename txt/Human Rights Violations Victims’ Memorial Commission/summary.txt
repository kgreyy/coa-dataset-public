C)	Scope of Audit



	The audit covered the financial transactions as well as selected areas of operations of the HRVVMC for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020.  It was aimed to a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities;  c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.





D)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the HRVVMC for CY 2020 due to accounting deficiencies, the details of which are discussed in Part II of this report and the analysis of their effects on the Financial Statements are shown in Annex B:



1)	The existence and accuracy of the cost and net carrying amount of Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling P6.169 million and P5.990 million, respectively, could not be ascertained due to unresolved variance of P1.631 million between accounting and property records resulting from the inadequate inventory taking procedure and non-reconciliation of PPE records by the Property  and  Accounting Units  required under the Government Accounting Manual (GAM).  Moreover, the risk of property losses and misappropriation is imminent in view of ineffective PPE tracking and monitoring.  (Paragraph No. 1.5.2.)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) create Inventory Committee thru Office Order indicating the responsibilities of such committee including among others, the regular conduct of inventory taking, investigation and adjustments of noted deficiency/ies and the preparation of the Report of Physical Count of PPE as required under Section 38, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I; (b) direct the Property Officer and the Accountant to conduct periodic reconciliation of their records to identify and adjust any discrepancy and to conduct further investigation in case of missing property; (c) direct the Property Officer to be familiar and adept with the COA policies, rules and procedures concerning property management, appropriate use of property documentation and reporting; and (d) consider hiring regular employee to handle accounting function to provide a clearer line of responsibility and accountability in handling financial transactions and reporting. 



2)	The accuracy, existence and reliability of Inventories  totaling P1.018 million could not be ascertained due to unresolved variance of P1.067 million  between accounting and inventory records resulting from non-preparation of the Request and Issue Slip (RIS) and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) in issuing inventories and incomplete Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI).  Moreover, the HRVVMC is confronted by risk of inventory losses/ misappropriation amidst the absence of an effective inventory tracking and monitoring. (Paragraph No. 1.5.1)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) issue Office Memorandum directing all end-users/requesting party and Supply Officer to use RIS in requesting/issuing inventories as required under Sec. 17(d), Chapter 8, GAM Volume I;  (b) direct the Supply Officer to prepare and submit the RSMI regularly and the Accountant to consolidate all RSMIs for the preparation of Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record inventory drawdowns in the books as required under Sec. 17(g), Chapter 8, GAM Volume I;  (c) create inventory committee thru Office Order indicating the responsibilities of such committee including among others, the regular conduct of inventory taking, investigation and adjustment of noted deficiency/ies and the preparation of the RPCI as required under Sec. 17(i), Chapter 8, GAM Volume I; and (d) direct the Supply Officer to submit immediately all pending and completed RSMIs and instruct both the Accounting Division/Unit and Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to conduct periodic reconciliation of the Supplies Ledger Card and Stock Cards to identify and adjust any discrepancy. 





E)	Other Significant Observations and Recommendations



The following are the other significant observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this report:



1)	Delayed and non-submission of financial and accounting reports in HRVVMC for calendar year (CY) 2020 precluded the Auditor of the timely audit and deprived the agency of the benefit of the timely detection and correction of errors.  (Paragraph No. 2)

	

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require designated OIC Accountant to comply with the rules and regulations on the submission of financial reports and corresponding supporting documents and ensure that these are submitted to the Auditor within the prescribed period; (b) instruct the Property/Supply Officer to submit the required inventory/property reports, as well as the Contracts/POs within the deadline set; and (c) consider hiring an Accountant to handle accounting function to provide a clearer line of responsibility and accountability in handling financial transactions and reporting.



2)	The absence of Registry of Allotments and Notice of Cash Allocation (RANCA) to adequately monitor the NCAs; and the delays in the processing and payment of the agency’s obligations for the year, resulted in the non-utilization and reversion of P5.383 million comprising 15.43 percent of the total NCAs of P34.888 million in CY 2020.  (Paragraph No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) instruct the Accountant to prepare and maintain the RANCA to provide an updated and accurate information of NCA utilization and balances for Management corrective action;  (b) instruct the processing clerks and the Accountant to speed up the processing and ensure timely payment of Accounts Payable to preclude incurrence of unutilized balance of NCAs causing its reversion; and (c) strictly adhere to the regulations and guidelines set forth in COA and DBM Circulars on the preparation and submission of agency’s financial reports and accountabilities, moving forward.



3)	Although the HRVVMC had implemented activities related to women empowerment and gender equality as well as addressing the gender issues totaling P0.972 million, it had no PCW approved GAD Plan and Budget which is P1,744,150.00 or five percent of the FY 2020 budget due to the absence of a responsive GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) that shall take the lead in mainstreaming gender in agency Program, Activity, Project (PAPs) thus, attainment and delivery of all GAD objectives and programs were not ensured. (Paragraph No. 4)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) mmediately appoint a GAD Focal Person and members of GFPS provided in PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2011-01; (b) institutionalize GAD through policies and procedure, capacitate employees on GAD concepts and principles and delegate personnel to take orientation seminars on GAD related laws; and (c) direct the appointed members of GFPS to timely prepare GPB for GAD related activities in compliance with PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and relevant provision under the General Appropriations Act (GAA).





The above findings and recommendations contained in the report were communicated with concerned agency officials through Audit Observation Memorandum.
