Low fund utilization of MOOE and CO



2)		Overall, the IPOPHL’s fund utilization of ₱599.988 million is 73.18 percent compared to its revised approved budget of ₱819.893 million during the year, of which  29.83  percent or  ₱244.606 million pertains to one of its major programs, the IP Registration, which registered a utilization rate of 95.19 percent or ₱232.847 million and in accordance with the purpose of the allotted budget.  The balance of budget of ₱219.905 million was due to its failure to implement various projects programmed for MOOE and CO brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 



Section 14.1 of RA No. 8293, otherwise known as the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines provides that “For a more effective and expeditious implementation of this Act, the Director General shall be authorized to retain, without need of a separate approval from any government agency, and subject only to the existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations, all the fees, fines, royalties and other charges, collected by the Office under this Act and the other laws that the Office will be mandated to administer, for use in its operations, like upgrading of its facilities, equipment outlay, human resource development, and the acquisition of the appropriate office space, among others, to improve the delivery of its services to the public. This amount, which shall be in addition to the Office’s annual budget, shall be deposited and maintained in a separate account or fund, which may be used or disbursed directly by the Director General.

	

The IPOPHL's revised approved budget for CY 2020 amounted to ₱819.893 million, of which ₱599.989 million or 73.18 percent were utilized during the year. Despite the budget utilization rate reached 73.18 percent, the agency incurred low utilization rates for the allotted budgets for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlay (CO) posting at only 52.78 percent and 25.35 percent, respectively. On the other hand, the IPOPHL has disbursed ₱553.128 million or 92.19 percent of its Budget Utilization for CY 2020. During the year, it has not incurred low cash utilization in any of the three budget classes. The details are presented below:

The Report of Budget and Utilization per Bureau/Office revealed that the non-utilization of ₱191.679 million in the MOOE (travelling expenses, training and advertising expenses, other professional and consultancy services) and ₱7.415 million of the CO (procurement of ICT equipment, office equipment, furniture and fixtures and other Property, Plant and Equipment) was due to the non-implementation of numerous programs and projects of the Bureaus/Offices,  non-procurement due to time constraints and the adoption of the Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.  

	

The IPOPHL has consistently incurred low utilization in the MOOE and CO for the last three years, from CYs 2017-2019, as shown on the next page:

Thus, except for this year’s low utilization caused by the COVID pandemic, this consistent low utilization in the MOOE and CO in the prior years’ reflects the agency's inability to fully implement projects and activities programmed for the applicable year and non-strict monitoring of budget utilization.



It is worthy to mention, however, that the Budget Utilization of 73.18 percent for the year is three percent higher than the utilization for CY 2019 which was ₱638.957 million out of its ₱912.119 million approved budget or 70.05 percent.



On the contrary, the IPOPHL registered a high utilization rate of 95.19 percent or ₱232.847 million out of the total budget of ₱244.606 million for its Major Final Output (MFO) No. 1 - IPO Registration, which was in accordance with the purpose of the allotted budget. It also posted the same rate of 95.37 percent of disbursement or ₱222.072 million of its utilization. Details shown below:

Despite the high utilization of fund for this MFO, it registered a significant low utilization for CO at only 7.02 percent. This is attributed to the non-procurement of PPE of the BOP, BCRR and IPSOs. 



Management commented that there is already monthly reporting of the budget utilization of each Bureau/Office in the ExeCom meeting to monitor the agency’s fund utilization.



We reiterated our recommendations, with modification, and Management agreed to:

	

a)		henceforth, fast track the implementation of all budgeted programs and projects to prevent low utilization of funds; 

	

b)		allocate budget only for programs and projects that can be implemented by the respective Bureau/Office during the year; and

	

c)		consider other possible budget reforms aside from strict monitoring of Bureau/Office budget utilization to improve the agency budget determination and programming.



Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary funds

	

3)		The IPOPHL has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. All fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for its use, were deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Sections 4 to 14 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income).



Granting and Liquidation of cash advances



4)		Cash advances during the year for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to ₱2.943 million were granted and liquidated, respectively, in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. There were also no unliquidated cash advances in prior years.

	

Granting and Liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs



5)	The IPOPHL has no fund transfers to implementing agencies such as National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)/ People’s Organizations (POs) during the year and prior years. 



Non-liquidation of fund transfer to PS-DBM



6)	Fund transfers to the PS-DBM for the procurement of common-use supplies during the year amounting to ₱0.334 million were all liquidated as of year-end, however, transferred funds for prior years amounting to ₱0.833 million remained undelivered as of year-end depriving the agency of the timely use of the items necessary in its operations.



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets out the rules and regulations in the grants, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred from the Source Agency (SA) to the Implementing Agency (IA). The SA shall require the submission by the IA of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds transferred within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project; and the return to the SA of any unused balance upon completion of the project. 



During the year, the IPOPHL transferred ₱0.334 million to the Procurement Service (PS-DBM) for the procurement of common-use supplies on which all the items requested were delivered by the latter. However, ₱0.833 million transferred funds for the prior years remained undelivered to the IPOPHL as of year-end.



The undelivered goods from the PS-DBM deprived the agency of its timely use of the items necessary in its operations.



Management commented that the remaining balance was already communicated by the Supply Officer to the PS-DBM, however, the latter declined to deliver since according to them, they already reverted all those dormant advances from government agencies to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr). The audit team emphasized that since IPOPHL is a self-sustaining agency, such advances should not have been reverted to the BTr but instead, refunded to the IPOPHL if the delivery of the requested items could not be made.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Supply Officer to make representation with the PS-DBM to request the BTr to release the reverted funds to the IPOPHL.



Non-submission of supporting documents to the request for write-off filed



7)	Dormant receivable accounts amounting to P0.117 million were requested for write-off during the year, however, the relevant and applicable supporting documents validating the existence of the conditions of the accounts were not submitted, thereby, precluding the audit team to verify and validate the documents and decide on the request filed within the prescribed period.



Section 8.3 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 states that “the request shall be supported by the following documents:



a)		Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by the Accountant and approved by the Head of the government entity;

	

b)		Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions, as applicable, such as:



b.1  Death Certificate issued by PSA;

b.2  Proof of Insolvency;

b.3  Certification from DTI that the debtor has no registered business;

b.4  Certification from SEC that the corporation is no longer active;

b.5  Certificate of no residence in the barangay of the municipality or city of last     known address;

b.6  Proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables and demand to liquidate the cash advances or fund transfers, such as but not limited to copies of served or returned demand letters;

b.7  Certification by Legal Officer of the entity of no pending case relative to the account;

b.8  Certification by the  responsible officials of the entity to the effect that there are no records/documents available to validate the claim;

b.9  Other justifications, like in the case of request for write-off due to loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss should be stated in the letter-request; or

b.10  In case of fund transfer, the unliquidated amount after reconciliation shall be supported by certification by the Chief Accountants and approved by the Heads of the source and implementing entities that the fund was utilized for the purpose, and certification from the recipient that the project was partially or fully implemented, supported by pictures of the implemented projects.”



Other receivables of seven resigned/retired accountable officers amounting to P0.117 million remained outstanding/inactive for more than 10 years and thus considered dormant.



The subject receivables do not exceed the P0.100 million threshold for the Audit Team Leader (ATL) and Supervising Auditor (SA) to decide. These receivables have no available records/documents to support/validate the claims and as a result, the management could not send Demand Letters (DLs) or the DLs were returned for reason of “move out.” Therefore, it can be presumed that its settlement or collectability is doubtful or could no longer be ascertained.



On December 14, 2020, the management filed with the Audit Team a request for write-off for these receivables. However, it was noted that only the schedule of the dormant accounts was attached as supporting document to the request. The relevant and applicable documents validating the existence of the conditions of the receivables or those mentioned in Section 8.3 (b) of the abovementioned Circular were not attached to the request filed.



The non-submission of the relevant supporting documents precluded the audit team to verify and validate the documents and decide on the request for authority filed within 15 day prescribed period.



Management commented that the non-submission of the applicable supporting documents for the dormant accounts requested for write-off was caused by the failure of the concerned Accounting Personnel to timely consolidate the said documents.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the concerned Accounting Personnel to fast track the consolidation of the applicable supporting documents to the request filed to facilitate timely verification and validation of the same.



Insurance of physical assets with GSIS



8)	The IPOPHL insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱82.386 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱0.374 million, in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



9)	Unserviceable property with total cost of ₱5.356 million remained not disposed of due to time constraints, thus exposing them to further deterioration or decreasing their realizable value and entailing additional storage cost. 



Section 79 of PD 1445 provides that “When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission.”



The IIRUP for CY 2020 disclosed unserviceable property amounting ₱5.356 million. Details as follows:

According to the Vice Chairman of the Inventory Committee, these unserviceable property remained not disposed of as of year-end because it was only in November 2020 that they have completed the inventory taking. The property are currently stored in their rented two container vans located in Malabon City due to the lack of space in the IPOPHL building. For CY 2020, the total amount of ₱0.161 million were paid for the rent of the two container vans.



The non-disposal of unserviceable property resulted in prolonged exposure of these property to further deterioration or decreasing their realizable value. This also resulted in additional cost incurred by the agency for the rent of its storage facility.



Management commented that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the schedule of disposal in CY 2020 was put on hold. The disposal of said unserviceable property is scheduled on or before April 15, 2021.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Disposal Committee to immediately dispose of the unserviceable property by lot or the same category/ description, either by sale, donation, condemnation/destruction, transfer or barter, as the case may be, to prevent further deterioration and additional storage cost.



	Emergency Procurement during State of Public Health Emergency (COVID-19 Pandemic)

	

10)	The IPOPHL’s procurement of goods and services during the State of Public Health Emergency arising from the COVID-19 amounting to ₱1.450 million were in accordance with COA and Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 dated March 26, 2020, Emergency Procurement by the Government During a State of Public Health Emergency Arising From The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).



	Delayed submission of government contracts 

	

11)	Sixty-seven (67) POs for CY 2020 amounting to ₱9.617 million were submitted within the prescribed period, however, 132 contracts amounting to ₱96.203 million were belatedly submitted, with delays ranging from one to 72 days, thus affecting timely review and communication of audit results to management. Moreover, 66 contracts and their supporting documents submitted and reviewed amounting to ₱82.604 million were verified to be complete and in order.



Section 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that “a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned… x x x” 



On the other hand, Section 3.1.1 of the same Circular  provides that "Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of the contract and each all the documents forming part thereof by reference and incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned."



For CY 2020, the IPOPHL has submitted 67 POs amounting to ₱9.617 million within the prescribed period provided in the Circular. However, with respect to contracts, only 61 out of the 193 contracts were submitted within prescribed timeline, thus, the remaining 132 contracts amounting to ₱96.203 million were belatedly submitted to the audit team contrary to the aforecited regulation.

The delay in the submission of the contracts ranges from one to 72 days reckoned after the lapse of five working days from the perfection of the same, which precluded the audit team in the timely auditorial review and prompt communication of any deficiencies that may be found in the process.



Moreover, the total 66 contracts perfected with its suppliers and technical Contracts of Service (COS) workers amounting to ₱82.604 million were found to be compliant with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and with complete documentary requirements.



Management commented that the delay in the submission was due to the difficulty in the consolidation of the supporting documents of the contracts and late  notarization of the contracts after its signing/perfection by the concerned Personnel end user Bureau/Office and also the adoption of AWA because of the COVID pandemic.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the concerned Personnel of the end user Bureau/Office to have the contracts notarized on the day they have been signed and perfected.

Their salaries were charged against MOOE in the total amount of ₱54.903 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.



GAD Budget, Utilization and Accomplishments



17)	Of the agency's approved budget of ₱819.893 million for CY 2020, only ₱34.187 million or 4.17 percent was allocated/attributed for GAD activities, which is below the mandatory rate of at least five percent, while actual expenditures of ₱84.789 million or 248.02 percent of the GPB were incurred during the year. Moreover, the submitted GPB was not approved/endorsed by PCW.



Section 31 of RA No. 11465 otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 provides that: “the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsiveness governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.”



As required under the law, the agency formulated a GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) amounting to ₱34.187 million or 4.17 percent of its approved budget of ₱819.893 million for CY 2020. This falls short of the mandatory rate of five percent under the above-cited regulation. 



However, the agency incurred the amount of P84.789 million for GAD activities which exceeded the GPB by P50.602 million and resulted in a utilization rate of 248.00 percent of its allotted budget.   



The GAD Focal Person disclosed that the amount incurred for GAD activities exceeded the GPB due to the attribution of GAD related cost in the regular activities of the agency. The Human Resource Development Division and the Office of Strategic Management (OSM) implemented a policy requiring all project proposals from various bureaus to have a GAD component. All proposed PAPs during the year have GAD component which resulted in the implementation of GAD sensitive and responsive projects and programs of the IPOPHL. Nevertheless, the GAD Focal Person informed that such attribution of GAD in their regular programs, projects and activities (PAPs) were not included in the GPB for the year since they were not that estimated GAD attribution may be included in budget.



Moreover, it was also revealed that the GPB for CY 2020 was not submitted to the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), thus, not approved or endorsed by the same.



Section 8.5 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01 re: Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual GAD Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta of Women provides that “PCW shall acknowledge in writing the receipt of the GPBs within two (2) working days. It shall then review and inform the agency of its comments or action on the GAD plans within fifteen (15) working days. If there are revisions to be made or questions to be answered about the submissions, the agency shall be given thirty (30) days to resubmit the GPB. Upon receipt and acceptance of the revised GPBs, PCW shall endorse all revised GPBs and return these to the different line departments or central agencies for their submission to DBM.”



This non-submission of the GPB precludes the PCW from conducting review on the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed activities/interventions in addressing gender issues towards the realization of the objectives of the country's commitments, plans and policies on women empowerment, gender equality and GAD.



The GAD Focal Person informed the audit team that he did not submit the GPB to the PCW since the Former Director General was not able to sign/approve it before the deadline set by the PCW.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the GAD Focal person to:



	a)	strictly comply with the mandatory rate of five percent for GPB; 



	b)	include the attribution of GAD related cost in the regular activities of the agency in the GPB; and



	c)	henceforth, secure duly approved/endorsed GPB from the PCW for submission to the audit team.



Senior Citizen and Person with Disability (SCPD) plans/programs



18)	The IPOPHL spent ₱0.052 million in the implementation of the activities for the SCPD in addition to providing ramps, a wheelchair and priority lane for them, in compliance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.



Implementation of ODA Funded Projects



19)	The IPOPHL did not receive and disburse Official Development Assistance (ODA) fund for this year and prior years.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund



20)	The IPOPHL did not receive and disburse Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Fund and/or Quick Response Fund (QRF) for this year and prior years.









Audit suspensions and disallowances



21)	Suspensions which matured into disallowances during the year amounted to P4.960 million while P0.065 million of audit disallowances of current and prior years of P5.527 million were settled during the year, leaving an unsettled disallowances amounting to P5.462 million as of the end of the year.

	

	Sections 9.4 and 10.4 of Chapter II of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 state that:

	

	“9.4	A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the NS; otherwise the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged after the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate. Consequently, the Auditor shall issue the corresponding ND/NC.

	

	10.4	The disallowance shall be settled within six (6) months from receipt of the ND by the persons liable.”

The ND issued during the year amounting to ₱4.960 million is on appeal  which was filed with the Director of Cluster 8 – Agriculture and Environment, National Government Sector (NGS) of COA on August 20, 2020 and is awaiting decision as of to date.



The beginning balance of ND amounting to ₱0.567 million pertains to the disallowance of excessive Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) of various IPOPHL officials and employees, which the Supreme Court declared final and executory on July 11, 2017. Two persons liable who are still connected with the agency settled their liabilities amounting to ₱0.065 million during the year thru monthly installment payments, in accordance with an approved request from COA-LSS-PLO, leaving the balance of ₱0.502 million as of year-end. On the other hand, demand letters were sent to three employees who were no longer connected with the IPOPHL. Of these inactive employees, one deliberately refused to settle his liability amounting to ₱0.130 million. The IPOPHL already referred this to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) for the appropriate filing of a collection case. Moreover, the demand letters sent to the remaining two inactive employees were returned due to addressees moved out. According to the HR Head, their present whereabouts are unknown and one was already an immigrant.



Management informed that they already filed the Small Claim Case against the erring employee at the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) – Taguig City. The first hearing on the case was already set on March 24, 2021.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	locate the inactive persons liable to the disallowance and/or require the approving/certifying officers to cover their liabilities; and



b)	continue pursuing the Small Claim case filed against the erring former employee until its termination.
