EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	Introduction



The Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL), an attached agency of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), was created by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 8293, otherwise known as the “Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines”, which was signed into law on June 6, 1997 and took effect on January 1, 1998.  The said law abolished the Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer (BPTTT) of the DTI.  All unexpended funds, property, equipment, records and personnel of BPTTT were transferred to the IPOPHL. The IP Code was further amended by: (i) RA No. 9150 dated August 6, 2001; (ii) RA No. 9502 dated June 6, 2008 and (iii) RA No. 10372 dated February 28, 2013. The latter amendment provided for the addition of the Bureau of Copyrights and Related Rights (BCRR) to the organization of the IPOPHL and granted the Office enforcement functions with the support of other government agencies.



The IPOPHL’s vision is a progressive Philippines using intellectual property assets for inclusive economic and social development by 2030 and its mission is to build an inclusive intellectual property system serving the needs of the Filipinos. The IPOPHL also adopted their strategic goals known as “BRIGHT “or the 6 point agenda for 2020-2025 which stands for: (i) Building Collaboration and Partnership; (ii) Raising the Ante for Customer Service; (iii) Integrate IP Awareness and Education into Society; (iv) Go Back to Basics; (v) Highlight Human Capital; and (vi) Transform IPOPHL into a Fully Digitalized Agency.



The IPOPHL is headed by Atty. Rowel S. Barba, Director General and assisted by two Deputy Directors General. It consists of seven Bureaus, namely: (a) Bureau of Patents (BOP); (b) Bureau of Trademarks (BOT); (c) Documentation and Information Technology Transfers Bureau (DITTB); (d) Bureau of Legal Affairs (BLA); (e) Bureau of Copyright and Related Rights (BCRR); (f) Financial Management and Administrative Service (FMAS); and (g) Management Information Service (MIS). Each Bureau is headed by a Director and assisted by an Assistant Director.

	

IPOPHL was mandated to perform the following major functions: (a) examine applications for grant of letters patent for inventions and register utility models and industrial designs; (b) examine applications for the registration of marks, geographic indication, integrated circuits; (c) register technology arrangements and settle disputes involving technology transfer payments covered by the provisions of RA No. 8293 on Voluntary Licensing and develop/implement strategies to promote and facilitate technology transfer; (d) promote the use of patent information as a tool for technology development; (e) publish regularly in its own publication the patents, marks, utility models and industrial designs; issued and approved and the technology transfer arrangements registered; (f) administratively adjudicate contested proceedings affecting intellectual property rights; and (g) coordinate with other government agencies and the private sector efforts to formulate and implement plans and policies to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights in the country.

In an effort to provide a conducive work environment for its employees and a more modern and safe venue for its clients, IPOPHL moved from Makati City to its new office in McKinley Hill at Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City in May 2011.



	Of the 308 authorized itemized permanent positions under the Personal Itemization and Plantilla of Personnel approved by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), only 264 were filled up as of December 31, 2020. In addition to these filled up positions, IPOPHL hired 84 technical contractual employees and 120 service providers.

	The IPOPHL does not receive funds from the General Appropriations of the government since CY 2006. Instead, funds used for its operations are derived from its income from registration fees on patents for inventions, trademarks, technology transfers and the interest income on short-term investments placed in government depository banks.  As authorized under RA No. 8293, the IPOPHL deposited the fees collected in a separate account or fund, from which disbursements for its operations were sourced.



C.	Scope and Objectives of Audit



The audit covered the transactions, accounts and operations of the IPOPHL for CY 2020.  It was conducted to (a) ascertain whether the financial statements present fairly the financial position and the results of financial performance; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities to enhance operational processes/procedures; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



A)	Independent Auditor’s Report



		An unmodified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the IPOPHL.

		

B)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



1)		Overall, the IPOPHL’s fund utilization of ₱599.988 million is 73.18 percent compared to  its revised approved budget of ₱819.893 million during the year, of which 29.83 percent or ₱244.606 million pertains to one of its major programs, the IP Registration, which registered a utilization rate of 95.19 percent or ₱232.847 million and in accordance with the purpose of the allotted budget. The balance of budget of ₱219.905 million was due to its failure to implement various projects programmed for MOOE and CO brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. (Observation No. 2)



We reiterated our recommendations, with modifications, and Management agreed to:

	

a)		henceforth, fast track the implementation of all budgeted programs and projects to prevent low utilization of funds; 



b)		allocate budget only for programs and projects that can be implemented by the respective Bureau/Office during the year;  and

	

c)		consider other possible budget reforms aside from strict monitoring of Bureau/Office budget utilization to improve the agency budget determination and programming.

	

2)	Fund transfers to the PS-DBM for the procurement of common-use supplies during the year amounting to ₱0.334 million were all liquidated as of year-end, however, transferred funds for prior years amounting to ₱0.833 million remained undelivered as of year-end depriving the agency of the timely use of the items necessary in its operations. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Supply Officer to make representation with the PS-DBM to request the BTr to release the reverted funds to the IPOPHL.

	

3)	Sixty-seven (67) POs for CY 2020 amounting to ₱9.617 million were submitted within the prescribed period, however, 132 contracts amounting to ₱96.203 million were belatedly submitted, with delays ranging from one to 72 days, thus affecting timely review and communication of audit results to management. Moreover, 66 contracts and their supporting documents submitted and reviewed amounting to ₱82.604 million were verified to be complete and in order. (Observation No. 11)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the concerned Personnel of the end user Bureau/Office to have the contracts notarized on the day they have been signed and perfected.



The observations and recommendations were discussed with the officials concerned in a virtual exit conference conducted on March 11, 2021. Management comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.

	



C)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts



	Suspensions which matured into disallowances during the year amounted to P4.960 million while P0.065 million of audit disallowances of current and prior years of P5.527 million were settled during the year, leaving unsettled disallowances amounting to P5.462 million as of the end of the year.

	

	

A)	Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



Of the 21 audit recommendations embodied in the prior year’s Annual Audit Report, 12 were implemented and nine were not implemented as of December 31, 2020, wherein three were reiterated with modifications, where applicable.
