C)	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the transactions and operations of the DND for CY 2020.





D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the DND as at December 31, 2020 due to accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱20,436,306.71 representing 1.24 percent of the total Assets and accounting deficiencies amounting to ₱99,203,916.03.





E)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



1)	The balance of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account totaling ₱1,262,245,236.93 as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to the difference of ₱8,632,545.73 between the book balance of fund transfers and the confirmed balances by the IAs. Likewise, there was failure of Implementing Agencies (IAs) to fully liquidate long outstanding funds transfers (FTs) totaling ₱42,203,994.57. Moreover, additional funds were transferred to IAs despite previous unliquidated/outstanding FTs. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management: (a) require the Accounting Division (AD) to exert efforts to reconcile book balances with that of the IAs with unreconciled difference as well as those that did not reply to confirmation letters; and make necessary adjustments in the books, if warranted; (b) require the IAs to submit progress report and liquidation documents as required in the MOA in order to verify the status of the project implementation and fund utilization, respectively, and furnish the COA Office of such reports and documents for validation; and (c) refrain from transferring funds to IAs unless the previous FTs are liquidated.



2)	The existence and reliability of Office Supplies Inventory (OSI) account balance of ₱21,878,906.94 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) variances between recorded deliveries and issuances of the AD and the Property Office totaling ₱2,915,806.46 and ₱506,189.74, respectively; (b) inclusion of negative Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balance and non-moving items amounting to ₱14,940.43 and ₱6,103,112.63, respectively;  and (c) adjustment amounting to ₱10,670,440.19 without supporting documents contrary to Section 16, Chapter 8 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I. (Observation No. 2)

 

We reiterated our recommendations that Management: (a) require constant coordination between the Accounting Office and Property Office for proper coding and description of inventories and practice regular reconciliation of balances per books and physical count and make adjusting/correcting entries, if appropriate; (b) direct the Property Office to immediately provide the AD with copy of all Inspection and Acceptance Report (IARs) and other pertinent documents  to ensure timely recording of deliveries; (c) direct the AD to verify causes of abnormal balances of SLs; (d) require the Property Office to submit to COA documents to support issuances of non-moving and non-existing inventory items; and (e) direct the AD to submit to COA necessary documentary requirements in support of JEV No. 2020-12-004684.  



3)	The reliability and existence of PPE accounts balance of ₱256,022,258.07 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) inclusion of non-existing PPEs totaling ₱9,289,153.07; (b) unrecorded PPE found during the actual inventory-taking totaling ₱7,733,407.32; (c) difference of ₱1,438,882.00 in acquisition cost of PPE per PPELC and RPCPPE; and (d) adjustment amounting to ₱72,343,995.05 without necessary documents/reports. (Observation No. 3)                                                              

                                                                            

We recommended that Management: (a) consider implementation of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 to come up with reliable PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, condition and accountability; (b) coordinate as regards the recording of PPE found during the actual physical count; (c) verify the physical existence and status of various PPE recorded in the books but not in the RPCPPE, whether these are retired from active use,  held for disposal, or already disposed; and thereafter,  effect the adjustment on the accounts, if warranted; and (d) exert all efforts to analyze the composition of the remaining unreconciled balances and effect necessary adjustments in the books of accounts.



4)	Several provisions of existing rules and regulations were not observed in the implementation of procurement of ICT Equipment for Physical Security Project, such as: (a) failure to furnish the Office of the Auditor with copy of complete set of supporting documents of the contract; (b) failure to submit basis of the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC); and (c) delayed procurement process. Moreover, inconsistencies of information were noted in the submitted supporting documents of the contract which indicate poor documentation.  

(Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management: (a) submit the afore-cited lacking supporting documents; (b) submit explanation on inconsistencies of information/discrepancies of dates on submitted documents; (c) ensure to furnish the Auditor with copy of all contracts and its attachments within five working days from its execution, properly labelled and filed; (d) submit market research and feasibility study in support of the approved  project cost; (e) submit justification with supporting documents why procurement process was delayed; and (f) comply with the provisions of Annex C of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 pertaining to period of action on procurement activities. 



The foregoing observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of the agency during the virtual exit conference held on March 16, 2021.  Management comments were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.



F)	Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations



Out of the 45 audit recommendations embodied in prior years’ Annual Audit Reports, 29 were fully implemented while 16 were not implemented, of which nine were reiterated in Part II of this report.
