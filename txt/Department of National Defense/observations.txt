PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AUDIT



Inter-Agency Fund Transfers



1)	The balance of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account totaling ₱1,262,245,236.93 as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to the difference of ₱8,632,545.73 between the book balance of fund transfers and the confirmed balances by the IAs. Likewise, there was failure of Implementing Agencies (IAs) to fully liquidate long outstanding funds transfers (FTs) totaling ₱42,203,994.57. Moreover, additional funds were transferred to IAs despite previous unliquidated/outstanding FTs.





1)	

	1)	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides the following provisions:

	

Section 4.3	The fund to be transferred or sub-allotted to the IA shall be (a) in an amount sufficient for three months’ operation subject to replenishment upon submission of the reports of disbursements by the IA, or (b) the total project cost, as may be determined by the Heads of the two agencies in either case.

4.6	Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.3.

4.7	The SA shall draw a Journal Voucher to take up the reports.  The amount to take up the liquidation per the RCI shall be net of the cash advances granted by the IA to its accountable officers in accordance with Commission on Audit Circular No. 90-331 dated May 3, 1990.

4.8	The IA Auditor shall audit the disbursements out of the trust accounts in accordance with existing COA Regulations.

4.9	The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.

5.4	Require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures. Xxx

	2)	The balance of Due from NGAs account amounting to ₱1,262,245,236.93 as of December 31, 2020 consists of the balance under Trust Fund and Regular Agency Fund in the amount of ₱1,123,285,312.42 and ₱138,959,924.51, respectively. Details are presented below:

	3)	Analysis of the account disclosed that the amount of ₱1,118,970,500.00 or 88.65 percent of the year-end balance of Due from NGAs account represents CY 2019 FTs to AFP-GHQ and Philippine Army (PA) for the implementation of the following projects, to wit:

	4)	It was noted that Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) were executed by and between the DND and the above-cited IAs which require among others, submission of periodic/progress report to DND to monitor the status of project implementation.



	5)	Out of the three projects, only the Bamboo Plantation Program of PA had status report and liquidation of ₱3,000,000.00 during the year.  Inquiry with the Office for Financial Management (OFM), primarily responsible for the said FTs, disclosed that Management had already sent Memoranda to concerned IAs requiring submission of liquidation documents for and/or progress reports of said projects.  However, no liquidation documents were submitted` by IAs to DND as to date. It should be emphasized that Management strictly monitor the status of fund transfers since the balance of Due from NGAs account represents 72.50 percent of the total Assets of the Department.





a)	Discrepancy of ₱8,632,545.73 between the results of confirmation and book balance 



	6)	To ascertain the correctness and accuracy of the account balances in the books of the DND, confirmations were made to six IAs where DND funds were transferred. Out of the six Confirmation Letters (CL) sent, only two IAs with total book balance of fund transfers amounting to ₱9,060,555.31 responded, with total confirmed amount of ₱428,009.60 or a discrepancy of ₱8,632,545.73, details are shown below.

	7)	The confirmation replies from agencies showed the following reasons for the discrepancies:



--	The difference between the records of the PS-DBM and DND books was due to the reversion made by the former to the National Treasury for which supporting documents were still not yet submitted to the DND Accounting Division (AD) for recording; and



--	The amount of ₱3,664,942.28 represents fund transfers to OCD which was liquidated and recorded in the IA’s books but not yet recorded in the books of DND.



b)	Long outstanding fund transfers – ₱42,203,994.57



	8)	Further analysis disclosed that ₱42,203,994.57 or 3.34 percent of the account balance had been long outstanding and/or dormant in the books for more than five to 10 years while ₱1,150,041,242.36 or 91.11 percent had been outstanding for more than one to five years. Details are as follows:

	9)	From the provisions of the afore-cited circular, it is the responsibility of IAs to submit to SA the necessary report within 10 days after each month/end of the agreed period for the project so that the latter (SA) could record the liquidations or refunds made.



	10)	The data on the preceding table represent the balance of last year’s long outstanding fund transfers which was communicated to Management through AOM dated February 7, 2020. It is worth mentioning that ₱29,453,287.33 or 45.23 percent of the prior year’s long outstanding balance were liquidated during CY 2020 leaving a balance of ₱42,203,994.57 as of December 31, 2020.  



	11)	It was also noted that there were no available records to determine the status of the above projects, such as not yet started, ongoing or completed. Considering the length of time that has elapsed, it is presumed that the projects for which the funds were transferred were already completed as to date. 



c)	Subsequent funds transferred despite unliquidated and long outstanding balances



	12)	We also noted that additional funds totaling ₱70,000,000.00 were transferred to the AFP-GHQ despite existing unliquidated balance, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and causing further accumulation of unliquidated fund balances. 



	13)	The foregoing circumstances rendered the year-end balance of the Due from NGAs account unreliable.



	14)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the AD to exert efforts to reconcile book balances with that of the IAs with unreconciled difference as well as those that did not reply to confirmation letters; and make necessary adjustments in the books, if warranted;

b)	require the IAs to submit progress report and liquidation documents as required in the MOA in order to verify the status of the project implementation and fund utilization, respectively, and furnish the COA Office of such reports and documents for validation; and



c)	refrain from transferring funds to IAs unless the previous FTs are liquidated.



	15)	Management submitted the following comments:



a)	In the letter dated 08 February 2021 of PS-DBM re:  Remittance of Unutilized Prepayment Balances to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), the BTr has “swept” the bank accounts of PS-DBM to use the funds for the implementation of the Social Amelioration Measures to address the effects of the COVID-19 emergency. 



b)	Aside from the dormant balances from CY 2012 and prior, funds from savings from selected APRs in 2013-2019 were already refunded to the BTr by the PS-DBM. Necessary adjustments were drawn in the books to reflect the refund. Attached are the pertinent documents to support the said reconciliation.



c)	Included in the long outstanding fund transfers is the AFP scholarship share/subsidy from RA 6963 which became fully liquidated as of 15 February 2021. Moreover, unliquidated funds transferred to Philippine Army (PA) for the Bamboo Plantation Program was reduced by P4,713,410.00, liquidation was recognized under JEV No. 2021-01-000019 and 000020. 



d)	Remaining unreconciled balances of funds transferred to the other National Government Agencies shall be coordinated and adjusted in the books upon verification of documents duly submitted by the IAs.  





Inventories



2)	The existence and reliability of Office Supplies Inventory (OSI) account balance of ₱21,878,906.94 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) variances between recorded deliveries and issuances of the AD and the Property Office totaling ₱2,915,806.46 and ₱506,189.74, respectively; (b) inclusion of negative Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balance and non-moving items amounting to P14,940.43 and P6,103,112.63, respectively;  and (c) adjustment amounting to ₱10,670,440.19 without supporting documents contrary to Section 16, Chapter 8 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I.



2)	

	1)	One of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting as provided in Appendix A of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 1 is reliability of information that is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



	2)	Section 16, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides a clear-cut process in the requisition and issuance of inventory items with pertinent documentary requirements like the RIS and RSMI plainly enumerated for compliance.



	3)	Review and evaluation of the OSI account disclosed errors and/or deficiencies which affected the reliability of the account balances presented in the FS as of December 31, 2020.



	4)	Balances of the OSI as of December 31, 2020 in the records of the AD and the Supply Office disclosed a difference of ₱9,343,176.53, as shown below:

	5)	Based on the above table, the variance amounting to ₱21,949,513.44 pertains to prior years’ transactions, of which a net adjustment of P10,196,720.19 (₱10,670,440.19-P473,720.00) was recorded in the books as a result of reconciliation of records. Adjustment was made through JEV No. 2020-12-004684.  However, pertinent supporting documents, like Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and RSMI for the adjustments made were not attached.



	6)	 For current year transactions, it was also noted that there were variances on the amounts of deliveries and issuances between the accounting and property records.

	7)	Verification of submitted contracts and GL for OSI revealed that the variance on deliveries totaling ₱2,915,806.46 was due to the unrecorded supplies amounting to ₱2,907,556.58 received in December 2020 and discrepancies in recording of two POs totaling ₱8,249.88.



Variance on Issuances for the Current Year - ₱506,189.74



	8)	Scrutiny of records disclosed that variance in issuances amounting to ₱506,189.74 was caused by timing difference in recording of deliveries. We found out that improper coding of office supplies also contributed to the difference in recording. Some items cannot be issued without the correct stock number.  Moreover, the delayed recording of deliveries affects the availability of stocks in the e-NGAS which does not allow issuance of items with zero remaining quantity.  Monthly issuances per office and total variance are shown below:

	9)	The variance in the issuances amounting to ₱506,189.74 was due to the following:

--	Timing difference in recording of deliveries;

--	No available stock per accounting record;

--	Inconsistent recording of issuances;

--	Duplicate stock number.

 

        Negative and Non-moving Balances



	10)	Verification of SLs showed the existence of negative and non-moving balances amounting to ₱14,940.43 and ₱6,103,112.63, respectively. These observations were mentioned in Part II of the 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR).

(14,940.43)



	11)	Prior years’ negative balances were due to the recording of issuances without sufficient stock in the e-NGAS which resulted in the understatement of the OSI account.  Meanwhile, current year abnormal balances were caused by unposted entries in the e-NGAS which were subsequently approved/posted; hence, the reason for over issuance or negative stock balance.

₱6,103,112.63



	12)	Analysis also showed that 195 inventory items had no movement for years 2019 and 2020 and these items were not found in the RPCI submitted by SAO.



	b)	Dropping from the books without any supporting documents - ₱10,670,440.19



	13)	Moreover, some inventories have the same stock numbers but with different descriptions. This was caused by non-monitoring of the Supply Office of proper coding and description of inventories for recording.   In addition, there were instances wherein stock number per SC and SLC varies. This may lead to confusion during issuance of supplies and further complicates the periodic reconciliation of records between the two offices.



	14)	We reiterated our recommendations that Management:



	a)	require constant coordination between the AD and Property Office for proper coding and description of inventories and practice regular reconciliation of balances per books and physical count and make adjusting/correcting entries, if appropriate;



	b)	direct the Property Office to immediately provide the AD with copy of all Inspection and Acceptance Report (IARs) and other pertinent documents to ensure timely recording of deliveries;



	c)	direct the AD to verify causes of abnormal balances of SLs;



	d)	require the Property Office to submit to COA documents to support issuances of non-moving and non-existing inventory items; and 



	e)	direct the AD to submit to COA necessary documentary requirements in support of JEV No. 2020-12-004684.  





Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)



3)	The reliability and existence of PPE accounts balance of ₱256,022,258.07 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) inclusion of non-existing PPEs totaling ₱9,289,153.07; (b) unrecorded PPE found during the actual inventory-taking totaling ₱7,733,407.32; (c) difference of ₱1,438,882.00 in acquisition cost of PPE per PPELC and RPCPPE; and (d) adjustment amounting to ₱72,343,995.05 without necessary documents/reports.

	1)	Section 63 of P.D. 1445 states that, except as otherwise be specifically provided by law or competent authority all moneys and property officially received by a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as government property.  Government property shall be taken up in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or an appraised value.



	2)	Section 58 of PD 1445 provides that: Audit of Assets.  The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records, proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.



	3)	Likewise, pertinent provisions of the GAM, Chapter 10, Volume I, states the following:



Section 38. Physical Count of PPE.  The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE (Appendix 71) as at December 31, of each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31, of the following year.  Equipment found at the station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



Section 39. Derecognition.  The cost of the PPE together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed from the accounts.  The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.



Section 40 (d). All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection of Report of Unserviceable Property.  PPE reported in the IRRUP shall be dropped from the book xxx.



	4)	As of December 31, 2020, the PPE accounts disclosed an aggregate carrying amount of ₱128,559,965.94.  Comparison of the balances of PPE per RPCPPE and per GL disclosed a variance of ₱2,994,627.76, or a decrease of ₱88,027,573.05 equivalent to 96.71 percent compared to last year’s variance due to reconciliation made by Accounting and Supply Offices.

	--	Post-qualification of bid was conducted on December 16, 2019 based on Resolution No. 201 dated December 17, 2019 while Post-Qualification Report was prepared December 11, 2019 which is earlier than the date the TWG conducted verification and evaluation of bid; 

	--	Request for extension did not indicate the detailed/specific systems requiring extension;

	--	Secretary’ Certificate dated November 29, 2019, and Bid Securing Declaration and Omnibus Sworn Statement dated December 2, 2019 were both notarized on December 4, 2018, or a year earlier than the dates the documents were issued; 

	--	Copies of contract and supporting documents submitted on July 7, 2020, or 130 days after the execution of contract on February 28, 2020, were   not properly labelled and filed.



	7)	The non-submission of complete set of supporting documents required under COA Circular 2009-001 and RA 9184 hindered the Auditor from conducting complete and comprehensive review of the contract and its attachments including assessment of the project – from planning up to the actual implementation. Likewise, inconsistencies of information/discrepancies of dates on submitted documents signify poor documentation.



	8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	submit the afore-cited lacking supporting documents; 



b)	submit explanation on inconsistencies of information/discrepancies of dates on submitted documents; and



c)	ensure to furnish the Auditor with copy of all contracts and its attachments within five working days from its execution, properly labelled and filed.



b)	Basis of the Approved Budget for the Contract and necessity of other units included in the procurement of ICT equipment for physical security not submitted



	9)	Minutes of the meeting on the pre-procurement conference revealed that on November 6, 2019, the DND Security Management Committee approved the set-up and layout of CCTV cameras for installation as part of the DND Proper ICT Equipment for Physical Implementation Project in early 2020.



	10)	Likewise, the Technical Officer, DND, presented during the meeting the details of the project including the essential requirements of the bidding documents, schedule of requirements and technical specifications, among others, of the three system components. Market research for the project involving price quotations of three (3) prospective suppliers was also presented, as indicated in the minutes of meeting. Since there were no issues raised and objection, the Chairperson, TWG, approved the same with the recommendation of renaming the project to Procurement of CY 2020 DND Proper ICT Equipment for Physical Security.



	11)	Further examination of submitted documents revealed that it did not include the copy of set-up and lay out of CCTV cameras which was approved by USND. In addition, market research or technical benchmarking as basis of Management on the approval of unit cost of items to be procured was not submitted. Moreover, feasibility study on the necessity of the three (3) systems – CCTV Surveillance, Entry Management System and X-ray Scanner Systems, to support the benefits that the Agency and its personnel may acquire, was not attached.



	12)	The non-submission of market research and feasibility study on the procurement project hindered the Auditor from validating the Approved Budget for the Contract/price per unit of equipment and establish the necessity of procurement.



	13)	We recommended that Management submit market research and feasibility study in support of the approved project cost.   



c)	Delayed procurement process –



	14)	As stipulated in the Schedule of Procurement in the APP, the activities from advertisement/posting of Invitation to Bid up to Contract signing, should be done in the first quarter of 2020. However, the Advertisement/posting of ITB, Pre-Bid Conference, Submission and Opening of Bids, Bid Evaluation, Post-Qualification and Approval/Issuance of Notice of Award (NOA) were done in the last quarter of 2019 or earlier than the schedule in the APP.



	15)	Evaluation of the actual implementation of project disclosed that procurement activities took up to 188 calendar days starting from posting of ITB on November 14, 2019 up to the receipt of Notice to Proceed (NTP) on May 20, 2020, or delay of 52 calendar days based on the maximum period of action on procurement activities of 136 calendar days. Details are as follows:

	16)	It was observed that the contract approval was made only on May 6, 2020 through a Memorandum signed by the Chief, AS, when the approval/issuance of NOA and NTP was made on December 17, 2019 and May 20, 2020, respectively.



	17)	Moreover, it was confusing to note that the Contract Agreement submitted to the Audit Team was made and entered into on February 28, 2020, which is inconsistent with May 6, 2020, the date the contract was prepared and approved as cited earlier. 



	18)	We recommended that Management;



	a)	submit justification with supporting documents why procurement process was delayed; and 



	b)	comply with the provisions of Annex C of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 pertaining to period of action on procurement activities. 



	19)	The Management submitted the following comments:



a)	Contrary to the observation of the Auditors, the NOA was in fact dated "February 6, 2020", the date when it was received by the bidder. It clarified that the date, "December 17, 2019" was the date when the Post-Qualification (PQ) Team presented its PQ report to the BAC and the latter resolved to-recommend to the Head of the Procuring Entity (HoPE) the issuance of NOA in favor of the Single Calculated and Responsive Bidder (SCRB). The memorandum requesting approval on the recommendation was transmitted to the HoPE on February 3, 2020, upon approval of the GAA and Final APP.  It was on February 5, 2020 that the HoPE approved the recommendation and signed the NOA, which was received by the SCRB on February 6, 2020.



b)	On the observation that Resolution No. 201 issued on December 17, 2019 stated that the TWG conducted PQ on December 16, 2019; however, PQ Report was prepared on December 11, 2019 which is ahead from the date that TWG conducted PQ. The Committee informed the Auditors that the date December 16, 2019 was a mere typographical error and that it actually meant December 11, 2019. 



c)	On the observation that the Secretary's Certificate of the bidder dated November 29, 2019, and Bid Securing Declaration and Omnibus Sworn Statement dated December 2, 2019 were notarized a year before the Submission and Opening of Bid Envelopes (SOBE), management submit that the indicated date, December 4, 2018, was a case of error of date stamping committed by the Notary Public and that the document was notarized and intended to be dated on December 4, 2019.



d)	To reckon, a total of 103 days shall be excluded in the computation of delays. Please be guided that no less than the GPPB allowed the subsequent tolling of the periods for the Procurement Projects covered by the suspension, including the running of the 3-month period to award the contract and terminate the procurement process under Section 38 of RA No. 9184, during the suspension of the conduct of procurement activities, as determined by the BAC. Verify, the DND Proper BAC in its Resolution No. 031 dated June 16, 2020 applied the tolling of period for the procurement of project covered by suspension in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.



	20)	Auditor’s Rejoinder



While the Audit Team acknowledged the comments of Management, several documents remained unsubmitted to verify the justification made. As to inconsistencies of information in the documents attached to the contract, we maintain our position that the same indicates poor documentation and apparently void documents.  





Non-compliance with COA Circular 95-006 on the submission of Notices of Delivery



6)	Non-submission by Management of copy of the Notice of Accepted Deliveries (NAD) with complete supporting documents on deliveries of equipment, software, materials, labor, installation, testing, commissioning and turn-over of CCTV Surveillance, Entry Management and X-ray Scanner Systems of systems amounting to ₱14,549,999.73, hindered the Auditor from validating actual items delivered and providing Management with relevant observation based on actual inspection.



a)	Late submission of Notice of Delivery



e)	

	1)	Paragraph 6.06 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 states that the official responsible for or in charge of accepting deliveries of procured items shall, within 24 hours from such acceptance, notify the auditor of the time and date of the scheduled deliveries.



	2)	Management failed to furnish the Audit Team with copy of Notice/Report of Accepted Deliveries together with the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) within 24 hours pertaining to deliveries of equipment, software, materials, labor, installation, testing, commissioning and turn-over of CCTV Surveillance, Entry Management and X-Ray Scanning Systems totaling ₱14,549,999.73.



	3)	The Audit Team received the Notice of Delivery on September 17, 2020 while deliveries were made on August 3 and 17, 2020.  Relative thereto, IAR was dated August 26, 2020 through the inspection of the Chairperson, Inspection Committee and Technical Inspection for IT Equipment and accepted by the SAO, DND Proper.



	4)	The absence of the Notice/Report of Accepted Deliveries together with the IAR and Request for Inspection prevented the Auditor from conducting timely inspection of items delivered and providing Management with relevant observations/corrective measures on any unfavorable circumstances noted during inspection.

	5)	We recommended that Management require:

	

a)	the SAO to submit justification for late submission of copy of Notice of Delivery and its attachments for the aforementioned project; and



b)	for the succeeding projects, the SAO to submit to the Audit Team copy of the Notice of Delivery with complete and properly filled out attachments within 24 hours from acceptance of deliveries.



b)	Various lapses found during actual inspection –



	6)	Actual inspection of units delivered on September 22 and 23, 2020 revealed the following observations for the CCTV Surveillance System:

	7)	It is indicated in the Bidding Documents that the Surveillance System shall be terminated, monitored and controlled at the designated central monitoring station (ISU Office – 1st Floor DND Building); however, some items for the said system were not found in the assigned location upon actual inspection thus, real purpose of equipment was presumed defeated.



	8)	The AT requested the SAO to furnish copy of the PAR and Distribution List of issued properties with complete details including serial numbers; however, no document was submitted.  Due to the limited information indicated in the DR, IAR, PO and non-provision of complete documents, the Audit Team was not able to match the actual properties found during inspection against the aforementioned forms; thus, reliability including the actual quantity and identity of equipment delivered was not ascertained.



	9)	Further inquiry with the TWG Member disclosed that cards to be used for gate barriers were included/provided by the supplier but not enough for all personnel assigned in the building. These were not indicated in the bidding documents and other attachments; thus, the Team presumed that the procurement for additional cards will be conducted separately.



	10)	We recommended that Management:



a)	submit the lacking supporting documents pertaining to the delivery and issuance of equipment; and 



b)	submit clarification/explanation on noted inconsistencies on the available documents and responses made by the SAO, Inspection Committee and BAC Committee.



	11)	The Management submitted the following comments:



a)	Due to the current emergency situation, the late submission of the copy of Notice of Delivery for the project was affected by the inability of the SAO, DND to be physically in the Office due to localized lockdown in her place of residence.  The AS, DND, then advised the SAO to work from home by reason of her underlying medical condition, hence, greater risk of being infected by the virus.



b)	Come August 26, 2020, date that the Notice of Delivery was prepared and the week that the SAO was able to report for work physically. SAO personnel were experiencing difficulty in the processing of necessary documents as required to be attached on the premise that the signatories to the IAR were   on   different   Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) in reporting to Offices, hence their inspection were only conducted depending on their availability.



c)	For the succeeding projects, the Supply Accountable Office properly observed the submission to the Audit Team copy of Notice of Delivery with complete and 	properly filled up attachments within 24 hours from the acceptance of deliveries in order to conduct timely inspection and communicate results thereof and also to avoid any sanctions for the failure of performing such duties.



d)	The lacking supporting documents were duly submitted to COA.





Delayed/Non-submission of financial and other reports and documents



7)	Management failed to submit on time financial reports/records such as DVs, Payrolls, ORs, JEVs and other documents for CY 2020 transactions, contrary to Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-06, Section 6.05 of COA Circular 95-006 and Section 122 of PD 1445; thus, precluding the Auditor from conducting timely audit of the transactions.



f)	

1)	

	1)	Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-06 dated September 15, 2009 provides as follows:



The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that:



			a)	The reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.



	2)	Section 6.05 of COA Circular 95-006 stipulates that:



The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within ten (10) days from date of receipt of said documents.



	3)	Section 122, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of P.D. 1445 provides:



Submission of reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.



(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.
