I)	OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit



Unadjusted accounting errors/omissions and uncorrected accounting deficiencies



			1)		A qualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements due to various accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱2,087.408 million, which exceeded the materiality level of ₱360.581 million and accounting deficiencies such as absence of subsidiary ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on 379 accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱32,362.002 million which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts.



	Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”

	

Accounting errors and omissions amounting to ₱1,048.762 million were corrected, as shown below:

The reasons posited by Management for the low and/or non-utilization in full of the respective allotments of PRDP, BAFE, RFOs III, VII, XI, and XII are as follows:



Office

Reasons

PRDP

--	The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the implementation of Investments in Rural Enterprises and Agriculture and Fisheries Productivity (I-REAP) subprojects which hampered the procurement and disbursement of funds as well as the lined-up activities for CY 2020 especially the conduct of training, monitoring of subprojects and provision of technical assistance to the proponent groups which comprised about 50% of the Component's budget allocation.

--	The approval and implementation of new subprojects were also delayed.

--	Budget allocations from the 2019 continuing appropriations amounting to ₱6.833 million were not obligated during the year, hence, no longer available for obligations in the next succeeding year, thus, said unobligated allotment will be reverted to the Unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund.

--	Non-implementation of some projects and activities, particularly trainings and travels and delay in the execution of the office lease contract  with the Sugar Regulatory Agency which resulted in additional unutilized allotment for mandatory expenses such as water, electricity, internet subscription, security and janitorial services due to the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic

RFO III

RFO VII

--	Funds were refocused/realigned to support the rehabilitation amidst COVID-19 pandemic;

--	Delayed approval and release of refocused funds, thus, procurement was held pending;

--	Discontinued training and traveling activities due to strict quarantine health protocols and travel restrictions;

--	Failure of biddings due to sudden increase of price brought about by the pandemic;

--	Non/late compliance of BAC requirements from the suppliers due to temporary closure of their business; and

--	Limited suppliers participating the procurement  

RFO XI

--	Different safety and health protocols implemented by various LGUs across the region affecting their mobility in the field;

--	Several lockdown incidents in the DA RFO XI;

--	Several employees had to undergo isolation/quarantine period; and

The fund utilization in RFOs III, IVA, IVB, and VI were reported in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. However, low utilization of funds was observed in RFO V, to wit:



Office

Observations

Management Comments

RFO V

Analysis of FAR No. 1 showed that the agency has utilized/disbursed ₱25.793 million or 74.06% out of the ₱34.825 million adjusted appropriations/ allotments under National Rice Program- Provision of Agricultural Equipment and Facilities in contrast with the GAA. The utilization rate for CY 2020 implies that implementation of various programs was affected, thus, intended benefits were not entirely delivered to its qualified beneficiaries and management’s function was affected.

Management considered the requests of        contractors/ suppliers for project duration extensions which subsequently caused the delays in the implementation of the projects due to the following reasons:



a.	Difficulties encountered in the transportation of materials, laborers and equipment needed for the construction/installation projects due to certain travel protocols implemented by different LGUs;



b.	Consecutive typhoons that hit the Bicol Region that caused damages and suspension of construction/installation activities.



The delayed or slow utilization of funds deprived the beneficiaries of the programs, projects and activities which the government has provided to alleviate the condition of the Filipino people at this time of the pandemic.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned offices of:



a)	PRDP to (i) ensure that appropriated funds are fully utilized the soonest possible time for the agency’s programs, projects and activities to hasten socio-economic development and benefits to intended stakeholders/beneficiaries; (ii) provide a catch up plan to maximize the available allotment to avoid reversion of the unutilized amount to the Unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund; and (iii) abide by the target timelines for future projects to provide the timely developmental benefits of the projects;



b)	BAFE and RFO V to ensure that funds allocated to the agency are utilized based on plans and targets to maximize utilization of funds;



c)	RFO III to continue the monitoring phase of the Program and conduct periodic inspection/validation on the operational status of cooperatives/associations/beneficiaries including implementing agencies to determine whether the support services and farm equipment extended are used for purpose of ensuring the maximum utilization of extension services/facilities for the attainment of the identified project objective;



d)	RFO VII to strategize the procurement process and ensure that all procurement activities are within the time frame to implement the programs and activities;



e)	RFO XI to (i) as much as practicable, fast track the implementation and completion of programs, projects and activities already funded; and (ii) identify, prioritize and formulate a comprehensive plan/program that would improve and normalize as quickly as possible the situation and living conditions of the Filipino people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; and



f)	RFO XII to communicate with the Central Office regarding the unobligated allotment due to the late downloading of funds and facilitate the obligations in the first quarter of CY 2021.



Cash utilization/disbursements



			3)		Of the cash allocation of ₱59,056.201 million received during the year, 83.39 percent or ₱49,249.663 million was utilized/disbursed, and the balance of ₱9,806.538 million or 16.61 percent was reverted to the National Treasury for the lapsed NCA attributable to delayed delivery of goods, delayed submission of disbursement vouchers (DVs) for payment, and non-implementation of some projects and activities due to the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, among others. Also, it registered cash utilization rate of 83.92 percent for Provision of Agricultural Equipment and Facilities under Rice Program wherein deficiencies and inconsistencies in the disbursements were observed in RFO I.

	

	Section 3.6.3 of NBC No. 578 on the release of funds for FY 2020 states that The Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP) or [Budget Execution Document] BED  No. 3 shall serve as basis for the DBM’s release of disbursement authorities including the comprehensive Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) as well as through later tranches as may later be required to cover the cash requirements of the agency for its regular operating requirements, in addition to those to be covered by other disbursement authorities (e.g., tax remittance advice, non-cash availment authority, cash disbursement ceiling).



Paragraph No. 1 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 enjoined the agencies to ensure the timely implementation of programs and projects, disbursement authorization documents are issued to make cash available within the schedules program/activity/project implementation period as reflected in the corresponding DBM-evaluated MDPs submitted by the agencies.



Section 2.1 of the aforesaid circular provides: All NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be credited for any month, whether part of the comprehensive releases or constituting additional NCA releases, shall continue to be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter covered.



In CY 2020, the following DA offices received cash allocation amounting to ₱59,056.201 million, of which 83.39 percent or ₱49,249.663 million was utilized/disbursed, and the balance of ₱9,806.538 million or 16.61 percent was reverted to the National Treasury.

Reasons for the lapsed NCA are as follows:



Office

Reasons for Lapsed NCA

DA-CO

--	Non-implementation of projects due to failed biddings in the procurement of the fertilizer component of the Rice Resiliency Project (RRP)

PRDP

--	Attributed to either excessive downloading of funds by the Project Support Offices (PSOs) to the Regional Project Coordinating Offices (RPCOs) or slow disbursement 

--	Non-submission of the LGUs to the RPCO, PSO Visayas, of the billing statements and other supporting documents for the processing of claims

BAFE

--	Non-implementation of some projects and activities, particularly trainings and travels due to the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic

RFO VII

--	Delayed procurement process, thus, disbursement was not materialized as targeted;

--	Difficulty in the retrieval of required documents for payment from LGUs/Farmers Associations (FAs)/farmers such as Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), Sangguniang Barangay/Bayan resolution, list of recipients, turn over documents due to travel restrictions;

--	Extension of deliveries were requested by suppliers due to unavailability of stocks brought about by the pandemic;

--	Delayed delivery of goods due to limited manpower, quarantine health protocols and travel restrictions;

--	Failure in the germination test of delivered seeds which resulted to an additional period of time to deliver for replacement; and

--	Extensions and suspensions requested by the contractor due to strict quarantine protocols and travel restrictions;

--	Unliquidated fund transfers to LGUs which impedes the succeeding release of their funds

RFO XI

--	Inadequate planning in the maximization of available resources

--	Failed biddings and/or unforeseen events

RFO XII

--	Delayed submission of DVs for Regional Agricultural and Fishery Council activities

--	Suspension of the operation of Cloud Seeding Operation (CSO) due to La Ñina advisories (weak to moderate), which is likely to persist until the first quarter of 2021 according to PAG-ASA 

--	Heavy rains for the past six (6) months experienced by the region, thus, the CSO was not implemented

Disbursements for PAEF in RFOs CAR, II and IVA amounting to ₱30.659 million, ₱39.627 million, and ₱50.851 million, respectively, were found regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable. However, various deficiencies and inconsistencies in the disbursements amounting to ₱82.150 million were observed in RFO I, to wit:



1)	Partial delivery of machinery per drop-off point was prohibited as per contract, however, review of the delivery receipts disclosed that the machinery, accessories and attachments were delivered on different dates

2)	As per delivery receipts attached, there were attachments and/or accessories which were not yet delivered, however, the Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR) indicated that the deliveries were completed

3)	Memoranda of Agreement, Certificates of Acceptance and post-master list of the equipment/machinery distributed were not submitted

4)	Notices of Delivery did not indicate the specific date of delivery in each of the agreed drop-off points

5)	Certifications/lists of the serial numbers of the equipment allocated to DA RFO I identified during post-qualification were not attached, hence, it could not be verified whether or not the serial numbers of the equipment delivered were the same as the allocated equipment

6)	Some of the dates of receipt by the DA RFO I representatives of the Delivery Receipts (DR) were not indicated

7)	The bidders’ technical proposals were not attached to the two procurements undertaken

8)	Changes in the drop-off points stated in the contract were requested, however, the reasons for the changes were not indicated

9)	The labels of the units delivered did not conform with the labels prescribed in the contract



Due to the above deficiencies, the expected benefits from the projects, activities, programs funded from the government funds were not fully realized to the disadvantage of the intended beneficiaries.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officers of:



a)	DA-CO to plan and strategize to ensure timely implementation of programs and projects especially during this time of pandemic in order to provide the benefits and services that are very much needed by various beneficiaries;



b)	PRDP to (i) ensure that disbursements are in accordance with government budgeting; and (ii) direct the National Deputy Project Director to ensure that the appropriated funds for the agency’s programs, projects and activities are fully utilized the soonest possible time/within the budget year to hasten socio-economic development and benefits to the intended stakeholders/beneficiaries and to avoid reversion of unutilized funds;



c)	BAFE and RFO XI to ensure that funds requested from the DBM are maximized and fully utilized to avoid the lapsing of NCAs;



d)	RFO I to submit the deficiencies and explain the inconsistencies noted in the disbursements under the Rice Banner Program;



e)	RFO VII to closely coordinate with FAs, LGUs, NGOs on the submission of required documents and constant follow ups shall be made to ensure that programs/activities/projects are delivered and implemented timely;



f)	RFO VII and XII to require all end users to immediately submit the DVs with complete supporting documents to the Accounting Section to facilitate its payment and to avoid the reversion of fund; and



g)	RFO XI to ensure that their planned projects/programs/activities are implemented in accordance with budgetary schedules and funding, and establish realistic targets that are attainable in the field to ensure utilization of cash resources.

			4)		Eleven DA offices reported no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular (JC) No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order (EO) No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. However, nine DA offices did not deposit to the National Treasury dormant cash, unnecessary fund/ unauthorized account and other receipts/revenues amounting to ₱87.908 million as of year-end.

		

			The Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management and Commission on Audit (DOF-DBM-COA) Permanent Committee Resolution No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 provides the rules and regulations implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the General Fund and for other purposes.

			COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 prescribes the accounting guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash balances, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds maintained by National Government Agencies (NGAs) with the depository banks.



			Moreover, Section 3 of Chapter 5 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. 1 states that unless otherwise specifically provided by law, all revenue (income) accruing to the departments, offices and agencies by virtue of the provisions of existing laws, orders and regulations shall be deposited in the NT or in the duly authorized depository of the Government and shall accrue to the xxx General Fund of the Government.



	Eleven DA offices (PRDP, BAFE, BPI, RFOs CAR, I, II, IVA, IVB, V, VI, and VIII) reported no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end.

Among the reasons for the non-liquidation of cash advances are as follows:



Office

Reasons

DA-CO

Cash advances were granted for the requirements for three months instead of two months as required

PRDP, BAI, BAR, BPI, BSWM, RFOs I, IVB, V, VI, X, XI

Full liquidation was not enforced and withholding of salaries of AOs with no liquidation submitted on January 20 was not made/effected even in previous years

DA-CO, BAI, SWM, RFOs V, IX, X

Grant of additional CA to AOs with unliquidated balance

RFO IVA, V, VIII, XII

Inadequacy of control in granting cash advances and monitoring of liquidation by management 



Allowing cash advances to remain unliquidated for a long period of time exposes agency’s funds to possible misuse and probable loss of supporting documents which would render liquidation a lot more difficult.



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to require the concerned officers of:



a)	DA-CO, PRDP, ATI, BAI, BPI, BSWM, RFOs I, IVA, IVB, V, VI, VIII, X, XI, and XII to instruct the Chief Accountant and all Accountable Officers to strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 on the grant and liquidation of their cash advances to avoid accumulation of unliquidated balances and to preclude from the withholding of their salaries, and the immediate return of any unutilized amounts of cash advances to the Collecting Officer;



b)	BAI, BSWM, RFOs IVA, V, IX, X, XII to refrain from granting additional cash advances unless previous ones have been fully liquidated;



c)	BAR, RFOs IVA, V, X to conduct regular monitoring and analysis of cash advances to ensure that these are liquidated within the prescribed periods to avoid accumulation; and



d)	ATI, RFO I, V, VI, IX, X to send demand letter to Accountable Officers with unliquidated cash advances.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs



			6)		Fund transfers to NGAs, LGUs, GOCCs and NGOs/POs during the year for the implementation of agency’s project amounting to ₱21,167.472 million, of which ₱17,541.533 million or 82.87 percent were not liquidated, were contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱20,209.835 million or 53.27 percent of prior year's balance of ₱37,935.213 million.

	

The following are the guidelines, among others, on the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing Agencies (IAs) and NGOs.



--	Within ten days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA. (Section 4.6, COA Circular No. 94-013)



--	The Source Agency (SA) shall require the IA to submit the required reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures. (Section5.4, COA Circular No. 94-013)



--	Within 60 days after the completion of the project, the NGO shall submit the final Fund Utilization Report together with the supporting documents to the SA. (Section 5.4, COA Circular No. 2007-001)

Funds transferred to IAs and NGOs during the year for the implementation of DA projects amounted to ₱21,167.472 million. Of the said amount, ₱17,541.533 million or 82.87 percent were not liquidated as of end of the year. Also, ₱20,209.835 million or 53.27 percent of prior year's balance of ₱37,935.213 million were still unliquidated, as shown below.

The following factors contributed to the accumulation of the outstanding balance:



Offices

Remarks

DA-CO

Non-assessment of the capability of implementing agencies to liquidate on time prior to the transferring of funds; fund transfers to LGUs were made in February, May and June 2020 despite being obligated and the MOA being signed in December 2019  

PRDP, ATI, BAFE, BAI, BPI, BSWM, RFOs CAR, IVA, IVB, XI, XII

Non-enforcement of the submission of Liquidation Reports (LRs) within prescribed period and failure to monitor closely the timely liquidation from the IAs

DA-CO, PRDP, BAFE, BAR, BSWM, RFO VIII

Fund transfers were still not liquidated despite the end of project duration

DA-CO, RFOs I, II, VII

Grant of additional fund transfer to IAs with unliquidated balance

RFO III

Absence of provision in the MOA of the timeline of completion of the projects; the penalty clause for the delayed implementation of the projects; and failure to liquidate the fund transfer and refund any unutilized balance by the IA.

RFOs I, II, IVA, V, VI, VII, IX, XI, XII

Inadequacy of control measures and lack of monitoring on the part of the management of the SA to ensure the subsequent utilization and timely liquidation by the IA/NGOs

RFO IVA

Non-reconciliation of records with DA RFO IV-B caused by the lack of formal request for the necessary supporting documents and status of fund transfer from DA RFO IV-B, and the lack of formal follow up/demand letters from the recipient NGOs/POs.

RFO XII

Non-compliance with the demand letters sent by management; supporting documents for the recording in the books of the IAs/SAs could not be located; Non-compliance to the provisions of the MOA, sanction and penalties are not provided in the MOA

The following factors contributed to the accumulation of the outstanding balance:



Offices

Remarks

DA-CO, RFO CAR

Undelivered procurements that were paid in advance by the agency to PS notwithstanding the unavailability of the items procured

ATI-CO

Failure  of the Property Officer to submit all Delivery Receipts to the Accounting Section on a monthly basis for recording purposes 

BAR

Failure of the Supply and Property Officer to follow-up the delivery of orders. Also, the Agency Summary of Payments and Deliveries of the Procurement Service as of January 13, 2021 showed that the BAR has an outstanding balance of ₱192,886.75 composed of ₱83,737.55 and ₱109,149.20 for the current and prior years, respectively.

RFO III

Confirmation with PS-DBM revealed that their records did not show any balance of obligation in favor of the agency and all items covered by check deposits were fully delivered. 



Management disclosed that such unreconciled balances were due to the transition of the persons in charge with the account, which should have been avoided if proper turn-over was made. The conduct of reconciliation has never been undertaken. 

RFO IVB

The Property & Supply and Finance & Accounting Units failed to coordinate with the concerned PS-DBM personnel or units for the reconciliation of funds transferred and actual deliveries for both CY 2020 and prior years.

RFO XIII

Deposit made to the PS-DBM for the procurement of plane tickets under the Government Fares Agreement (GFA) remained unutilized due to partial or non-availment thereof.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct concerned officers of:



a)	DA-CO to monitor the refund from PS-DBM for the undelivered procured items;



b)	RFOs CAR and XIII to require the PS-DBM to return all unused funds that were transferred to the agency in CY 2020 and in the prior years;



c)	ATI-CO to instruct Property Officer to submit all Delivery Receipts to the Accounting Section on a monthly basis for recording purposes;



d)	BAR to reconcile the balances per books with the Agency Summary of Payments and Deliveries of the Procurement Service and determine the cause of variance;



e)	RFO III to instruct the:



		i)	General Services Section Chief to retrieve the pertinent documents supporting the outstanding deposits from CY 2020 and prior years; coordinate with the PS-DBM for the necessary reconciliation of records and eventual settlement of the records’ disagreement, and furnish the Accountant of the monthly statement of accounts for regular reconciliation purposes;



		ii)	Chief Accountant to monitor the account and coordinate with and reconcile the accounting records with those kept by the General Services Section Chief regularly; and



f)	RFO IVB to immediately investigate, reconcile and require PS-DBM the immediate liquidation of prior years’ fund transfers which remained outstanding as at December 31, 2020.



Dormant accounts for write-off



			8)		There are no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and unliquidated fund transfers for write-off in PRDP, BAFE, RFOs I, IVA and XII; while ATI-ITCPH and RFO III had requested for write-off of dormant receivables amounting to ₱1.962 million and ₱1.168 million, respectively, in accordance with Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. However, 16 DA offices with dormant receivables amounting to ₱5,076.814 million have not requested for the write-off of these accounts, contrary to the said circular.



COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides the Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivables, Unliquidated Cash Advances, and Fund Transfer of NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs.



Section 5 of the circular defines the following terms:



5.4 Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.”



5.5 Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances - advances granted to disbursing officers, agency officers and employees which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



5.6 Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers- advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.



Further, Section 8.2 of the same circular provides that, “The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA). No filing fee is required” while Section 8.3 provides the list of documents that will support the request for write-off.



The PRDP, BAFE, RFOs I, IVA and XII reported no dormant account for write off while ATI-ITCPH and RFO III have pending request for authority to write-off of the unliquidated receivables amounting to ₱1.962 million and ₱1.168 million, respectively, awaiting decision from the Commission Proper, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the above circular.

Despite the presence of the above dormant balances, Management failed to file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers following the procedures prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



The failure to file the request for write-off is caused mainly by the on-going gathering of needed requirements to support the request, as commented by Management below.

Offices

Management Comments

DA-CO

Management have already requested for write-off of dormant accounts in October 2016; however, the request was returned due to non-submission of the required supporting documents.

ATI

Dormant receivable accounts of RTC CAR were requested for write-off, however, the request was returned due to insufficient documents.

BAR

Management have already instructed the Accounting Unit to prepare and finalize related documents to comply with the requirements of COA Circular No. 2016-005

RFO CAR

A request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts was filed by management in 2018 with the auditor, which, however, was returned for insufficiency of supporting documents. Management directed the Accounting section to comply with all requirements and resubmit the request for write-off for accounts with available supporting documents.

RFO II

Demand letters were sent to the concerned NGOs/POs; however, it was found out that most, if not all, are already out of business. Consequently, the management are taking necessary steps to have these accounts written-off from the books and they are on the process of gathering documents to support the said request.

RFO IVB

Most of these dormant accounts have been existing since before the division of Region IV into two ROs in CY 2013. Throughout this transition, the Finance & Accounting Unit commented that there was no proper turnover of files and documents that can support the validity of these accounts in the agency books. Despite lack of supporting documents, the management requested to COA the write-off of these accounts in CY 2018, however, upon disapproval of COA, no subsequent actions were taken to provide the necessary documents

RFO VI

The above accounts were unreconciled and non-moving since the time they had started using the Electronic New Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) in CY 2017. In addition, the reconciliation of the unliquidated fund transfers, thru visitation of the concerned government agencies with long outstanding balances, scheduled in CY 2020 was not however conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

RFO VIII

The accountant claimed that constant demands were made to the implementing agencies to liquidate the accounts, however, various reasons, such as difficulty in retrieval of the documents due to lack of turnover, especially in LGUs, has hindered the collectability of the accounts.

RFO IX

Accountant revealed that the details of cash advance could not be identified since it is not supported with schedules or listings of accountable officers, hence, validity of these accounts cannot be fully ascertained due to lack/unavailability of supporting records/documents.

RFO XI

Management explained that it is difficult to comply with the documentary requirements cited in COA Circular No. 2016-005 hence they have not yet drafted a request for write off.



The write-off of dormant accounts does not mean condoning/extinguishing the obligation of the accountable officer/debtor. Failure to file the required request for write-off resulted in the accumulation of long outstanding balances.



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to direct the concerned officers of DA-CO, ATI, BAI, BAR, BPI, BSWM, RFOs CAR, II, IVB, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and XI to exhaust possible means to secure the needed documentary requirements as stated in Section 8.3 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 and file the request for authority to write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, following the procedures prescribed under the said circular.



Insurance of physical assets with the GSIS

	Section 5 of RA No. 656 provides that every government, xxx, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the [Property Insurance] Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, xxx.

The delayed and non-submission of the contracts and POs/WOs together with their supporting documents precluded the Audit Team from conducting review of the contracts.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officers of:



	a)	DA-CO, PRDP, ATI, BAFE, BAR, BPI, RFOs I, III, IVB, V, and X to (i) cause the immediate submission of the perfected contracts and POs/WOs with all supporting documents and (ii) henceforth, ensure that these are submitted within the reglementary period with all required information in the contracts and POs/WOs completely filled-up; 



	b)	DA-CO, BAR, BSWM, and RFO I to properly accomplish all the needed information in the MOA/PO/WO and their supporting documents, and review for errors/inconsistencies prior to finalization and/or submission to the Office of the Auditor; and

	

	c)	all DA offices to impose sanctions against officials and employees who shall continuously fail to comply with the submission of contracts and POs/WOs in accordance with Section 4.1 and 4.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-001, dated February 12, 2009.



	Withholding and remittance of GSIS contributions, loans and employer’s share

	

			13)		Seven DA offices deducted properly and remitted on time the GSIS premiums and loans of employees amounting to ₱194.110 million, pursuant to RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997. However, seven DA offices did not deduct properly and remit on time the GSIS premiums and loans of employees amounting to ₱7.247 million, with delays ranging from 3 to 226 days. Moreover, 11 DA offices had unremitted amount of ₱5.768 million and subject for reconciliation in the amount of ₱7.997 million as of year-end.

		

		RA No. 8291 dated May 30, 1997 (GSIS Act of 1997) states that penal sanctions shall be imposed upon employers who fail to include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations or otherwise fail to remit the accurate/exact amount of contributions on time, or delay the remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS. The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS and each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees and employers’ contribution within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.

The non-remittance of employees’ personal share and loans may expose the concerned employer and employee, respectively, to penalties, interest and surcharges.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants of:



							a)	DA-CO, ATI, BAI, RFOs IVB, and V to remit on time all withheld contributions and loan amortizations to Pag-IBIG in accordance with RA No. 9769; and



							b)	BAI, BSWM, RFOs V, VI, and XII to exert extra effort to locate the documents/records and analyze/reconcile the unremitted balances and remit immediately the balances to Pag-IBIG, if warranted, to avoid penalties and enable all employees to enjoy the privileges and benefits accruing to the member.

	

	Withholding and remittance of taxes

	As shown in the table above, seven DA offices remitted properly the taxes they withheld on gross compensation income from officials and employees and those from private entities on government purchases and contract of services with the amount of ₱279.570 million. However, four DA offices did not remit on time the taxes withheld, with delay by 1 to 304 days, while fourteen DA offices had an outstanding year-end balance of ₱58.538 million of which ₱55.272 million were current year unremitted balances while the remaining amount of ₱3.266 million is prior year unreconciled balance subject for reconciliation.



The foregoing condition shows breakdown in the supervisory control in recording tax transactions and remittance of taxes withheld. Moreover, the unremitted taxes withheld unnecessarily exposes the DA to the risk of being fined and penalized.



	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants of:

	

a)		DA-CO, BAFE, BAI, and BAR to remit the amount of taxes withheld within the prescribed date in compliance with BIR regulation;

	

b)		BAR, BSWM, RFOs VI, and XII to trace the existence of unreconciled balances by analyzing the unremitted balances and remit immediately the balances to the BIR, if warranted, to avoid penalties; and

	

c)		All agencies with unreconciled balances and delay in remittance of taxes to strengthen the review over the recording of tax transactions and remittance of taxes withheld.



Hiring of and payments to job order and contract of service individuals 



			17)		The agency hired 9,491 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) with corresponding payments amounting to ₱1,941.407 million as of December 31, 2020 pursuant to CSC COA DBM JC No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as amended. However, deficiencies in the hiring and payment to JO/COS were observed in DA-CO, BSWM, BAR, RFOs I and XI.



CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1 dated June 15, 2017 provides the rules and regulations governing contract of service and job order workers in the government.



Whereas, CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1 dated November 9, 2018 provides amendment to CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1 dated June 15, 2017 stating that agencies may engage the services of new Contract of Service and Job Order workers through individual contract and renew existing individual contracts until December 31, 2020. 



In light of the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the operations of the government agencies, CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1 and 2 dated March 19, 2020 and October 20, 2020, respectively, were issued.



In CY 2020, 22 DA offices hired 9,491 individuals under COS or JO with corresponding payments amounting to ₱1.941 billion, as shown below.

However, the following deficiencies were observed in DA-CO, BSWM, BAR and RFOs I and XI with the corresponding management comments:



Office

Deficiencies

Management Comments

DA-CO

The number of COS/JO individuals hired exceeded the number of authorized plantilla positions by 25 or 3.73 percent and the number of filled-up positions by 149 or 27.29 percent when the agency has only 124 unfilled plantilla positions 



BSWM

Processing of payroll for the individual COS ranged from five to 53 working days from cut-off date caused by the absence of specific guidelines governing the preparation of their contract and the payment of their salary



BAR

Inconsistencies in the compensation of COS personnel.

Management commented that upon review by the Human Resource Management Unit, DA AO No. 13 dated December 5, 2018 authorized the hiring of COS with positions to be requested in accordance with the mandate/function of each officer. Further, position titles were used to indicate specific functions related to the ones included in the Compensation Matrix (CM). Regardless, further review of positions and compensation to align them with CM has been noted and approved.



COS individuals performing support/administrative functions were given different salary rates

Management commented that for the guidelines on the engagements of individual COS for technical positions, COS individuals were hired in the second semester of CY 2020, pursuant DA AO No. 13 which superseded and revoked items 4 and 5 of DA AO No. 8 dated August 24, 2018. Hence, their salary grades and positions were authorized thereunder.

RFO I

Entered into service contracts with individuals for services not related or incidental to its functions and operations





Hired a private lawyer without written conformity from the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and written concurrence of COA



RFO XI

Hiring of COSs and JOs despite vacancies in the plantilla of personnel



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officers of:



a)	DA-CO, and RFO XI to (i) revisit the staffing of COS and JO individuals as against the organizational structure of permanent employees; (ii) prioritize existing COS/JO individuals in the appointment to its vacant positions provided that these workers meet the appropriate eligibility and other qualification requirements for the position as required in CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1 s. 2017, as amended; 



b)	BSWM to prepare internal rules/guidelines on the contract preparation and processing of payment to individual Contract of Service;



c)	BAR to submit results of review and alignment in the DA-approved compensation matrix of the positions and compensation of COS individuals; and 



d)	RFO I stop from entering into service contracts for services not related or incidental to the agency's functions and operations and hiring private lawyers without the written conformity and concurrence of the Office of the Solicitor General and COA.



GAD Budget, Utilization and Accomplishments



			18)		Over-all, the agency allocated the amount of ₱10,320.085 million or 18.51 percent of the total appropriations of ₱55,759.680 million for GAD programs and activities, in compliance with Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020.  Moreover, planned activities were implemented with fund utilization of ₱2,284.483 million or 22.14 percent. However, RFOs VII, and XII failed to comply with the five percent requirement. 



The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



Section 31 of RA No. 11465 provides that all government departments shall formulate their annual GAD Plans and Budgets (GPBs) within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects. Accordingly, the following are among the important things to consider:



a)	The GAD budget, which will cover the cost to implement GAD programs, shall be at least five percent of the agency’s total budget appropriations.



b)	The GPBs and the Accomplishment Report (AR) are submitted, reviewed and endorsed online through the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS). The PCW-reviewed and -endorsed GPBs shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a Quick Response (QR) Code. The agency head shall sign the generated endorsed GPB and copies shall be submitted to PCW and COA.



c)	The agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the Audit Team within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe.

Delayed implementation of ODA Funded Projects

	

			20)		The 67 ODA Funded I-Build and I-Reap Subprojects amounting to ₱2,178.626 million are already beyond the target date of completion thereby delaying the delivery of benefits to the intended recipients.

	

	The I-Build Component is intended for the establishment of a network of strategic rural infrastructures which are referred to as subprojects including Farm to Market Roads, bridges, Communal Irrigation System (CIS), Portable Water System (PWS), production and post-production facilities and other infrastructure such as fish landings, fish sanctuary, protected area guardhouses, among others

	

	Section II, Schedule 2 of the PRDP Loan Agreement with the International Bank Reconstruction Development provides that the Borrower shall monitor and evaluate the progress of the project and prepare Project Reports on the basis of indicators specified in the Operations Manual. Moreover, each participating LGUs is required to carry-out its subprojects with due diligence and efficiency and maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate the progress of the subprojects and the achievement of its objectives.

	

	Whereas, the I-Reap Component with a 60:20:20 (LP: GOP: LGU) cost-sharing scheme, is intended to carry out specific subprojects to support vertical and horizontal clustering, joint business planning and investments, promotion of biodiversity conservation and coastal resource co-management arrangements, as well as carrying out of sustainable income-generating livelihood activities. Technical assistance to producers is also provided to increase productivity and incomes through improved and sustainable technological, operational and market knowledge and facilitation of market linkages. 

	

	I-Reap subprojects are implemented by participating provincial LGUs (PLGUs). Proponent Groups (PG), which refers to producer groups (farmers’/fisher groups, cooperatives, associations) or agri-processors, consolidators, exporters known as micro, small and medium scale enterprises, who signified interest to implement an enterprise subproject must submit a Letter of Intent and other eligibility requirement depending on amount of subproject proposal.

	

	Section II, Schedule 2 of the PRDP Loan Agreement provides that the Borrower shall monitor and evaluate the progress of the project and prepare Project Reports on the basis of indicators specified in the Operations Manual. Moreover, each participating LGUs is required to carry-out its subprojects with due diligence and efficiency and maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate the progress of the subprojects and the achievement of its objectives.

	

	As of December 31, 2020, PRDP has approved a total of 1,101 subprojects amounting to ₱30,693.937 million, with the following status of implementation:

	The following are among the reasons provided on the delays incurred in the subproject implementation with the corresponding management comments:

	

	Reasons for Delay

	Management Comments

	I-Build

	Pre-implementation issues that could have been avoided

--		Suspended due to Road Right of Way (ROW) issues on the donated parcels of land;

--		Not yet started due to the need to relocate; Project location is a forest zone area per DENR;

--		Issuance of numerous variation orders due to difficulties encountered during implementation which was not considered during the planning stage.

	PLGU Bulacan – 

	

	The Provincial Engineer committed to comply with the recommendations and asserted that the number of unworkable days were already considered in the determination of contract duration. However, the consideration for the number of rainy days could not be ascertained due to lack of operational weather station in the Province, as confirmed by PAGASA. He also committed to impose liquidation damages should the contractor incur delay in the project completion.

	

	MLGU Esperanza, Masbate 

	

	The MPMIU had already made an arrangement with other contractor, who currently has an existing project near the site, to repair the existing defect and deficiencies caused by original contractor’s fault by pulling out necessary equipment from the project site. 

	

	PLGU Iloilo

	

	The PRDP I-BUILD Component Head stated that discussions with the contractor’s technical staff on how to fast-track work accomplishments were always done by the representatives of the PEO during the course of daily monitoring of work activities.  However, it was emphasized that the realization of the targeted accomplishments solely rests on contractor’s available resources at site, such as equipment, manpower and materials, which they have no control.

	

	

	Proponent LGU

--		Slow procurement process;

--		Failure to terminate the contract despite abandonment by the contractor;

--		Non-issuance of Contract and Notice to Proceed to the contractor;

--		Series of reviews and revisions made to the project proposal;

--		Non-creation of MPMIU to monitor overall program implementation of the projects;

--		

	Force Majeure

--		Various suspension request due to inclement weather; unworkable site condition, earthquake calamity, peace and order condition, some were not supported with proper documents;

--		Various suspension orders were issued due to re-routing issues, Taal Volcano eruption, ECQ, and bad weather conditions;

--		

	Contractor

--		Terminated contract due to defaulting contractor;

--		Delayed preparation of the site for the Portland cement concrete pavement;

--		Non-compliance with the 18% gradient requirement for a PRDP project;

--		Unauthorized delay exceeding ten percent (10%) of the revised contract duration;

--		Deficiencies in the submitted legal documents by the contractor;

--		Failure to commence work despite receipt of the NTP;

--		Incurrence of negative slippages beyond the allowable negative slippage of 15 percent;

--		Delayed implementation due to limited materials needed and/or equipment and manpower at site. 

--		Failure of the contractor to expeditiously proceed with the work despite its commitments stated in the deed of undertakings; 

--		Inability of the contractor to perform the recommended/required changes and repairs;

--		Contractor’s fault by pulling out its equipment from the construction site during the contract duration when needed to be used for its other ongoing projects;

--		

	I-Reap

	PSO-RPCO-LGU

--		Prolonged processing of supporting documents needed for funding; 

--		Difficulty in securing some requirements from other government agencies like Environment Compliance Certificate due to lockdowns;

--		Awaiting receipt of NOL from RPCO/PSO before proceeding to rebidding after two failed biddings;

--		Delay in the approval and signing of the IMA and EIA;

--		Revisions made in the procurement plan;

--		Failure to properly supervise and monitor the initial stages of the subproject;

	MLGU La Trinidad, Benguet – 

	

	The OMAG utilized the greenhouse to showcase the technology on strawberry production per verbal request by some farmers who planned to shift to strawberry production where potted strawberry seedlings were produced.

	

	PLGU Aurora – 

	

	The Province had already released the funds needed by the project proponent in purchasing the needed equipment. However, due to increase in prices and restrictions on mobility during the community quarantines, there were still equipment which were not yet procured. As to the stolen items, the project proponent stated that they were already in the process of procuring their replacements.

	

	MLGU Esperanza, Masbate – 

	

	They are currently finding ways and taking the most appropriate action on how to make the I-REAP Subproject become operational. They also said that the previous PG, Puting Bato Rural Improvement Club, no longer exist and improbable of organizing again. They admitted that they are having a hard time on selecting the competent Proponent Group due to the fact that the current sole applicant, the Santiago Farmers Association, was mostly composed of women who are not fit or strong enough to perform the daily manual work in the production.

	

	PLGU Iloilo – 

	

	The I-REAP Component Head informed that as of March 4, 2021, the two Proponent Groups have already secured their bank certification as their cash counterparts.  Thus, full release of the funds will soon be processed and eventually utilized so that optimum benefits of the PRDP I-REAP projects will be enjoyed by the beneficiaries.

	Proponent LGU

--		Delayed/failure bidding process;

--		Delayed and inefficient procurement process;

--		Change of item because of the unavailability of the previous materials specified;

--		Deficient financial planning and monitoring;

--		Delayed issuance of NOL2 due to the inability of the LGU to submit some requirements;

--		Delayed implementation of the project due to the resignation of the previous personnel assigned to the project and there was no immediate replacement;

--		Delayed submission of documentary requirements for release of funds from DA;

--		Slow project implementation;

--		Civil works was suspended due to various reasons such as ongoing revisions on site development and inaccessible site of quarry;

--		Inadequate monitoring and evaluation on the implementation of the subproject;

--		

	Proponent Group

--		Re-organization of the recipient PG;

--		Failure of some PGs to encash the checks representing fund transfer on time;

--		Non-submission of Liquidation Reports by the PG;

--		Delay in the procurement process on the part of the PG;

--		

	Force Majeure

--		Inclement weather conditions;

--		Threats of disease paused animal-related subprojects;

--		Crops planted were destroyed by typhoon;

--		Delay in the procurement or did not push through at all due to pandemic or Taal Volcano eruption;

--		

	Supplier/Contractor

--		Failure to commence work despite receipt of NTP;

--		Incurrence of negative slippage beyond the allowable 15%;

--		Difficulty in finding a supplier for some procurements;

--		Lesser number than the required number of suppliers that participated in the bidding.

--		

	

	In effect, the social and economic benefits that could be derived from the subprojects could not be enjoyed by the intended beneficiaries due to delayed implementation of the project of which the LGU did not take advantage of when the financial assistance was granted by the national government.

	

	Likewise, the above deficiencies resulted in the non-attainment of the purpose of the PRDP programs/projects like poverty alleviation and social equity through the development and implementation of projects.



	We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to request the Local Chief Executive (LCE) of the 33 proponent LGUs to coordinate with the PSOs on the identified causes of delays to further prevent losses in terms of time and resources which were kept idle to the disadvantage of the intended users.

	

Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund

	

			21)		The agency received disaster related funds amounting to ₱3,495.255 million, of which ₱3,153.998 million or 90.24 percent was obligated in CY 2020. Out of the reported obligations, ₱1,894.17 million or 60.06 percent was disbursed during the year. However, deficiencies in the utilization of disaster funds were observed in RFOs IVA, X and XI.

	

RA No. 10121 more popularly known as the "Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010" aims to strengthen the governance framework for national disaster risk reduction and management and institutionalize the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (DRRM). The enactment of the law demonstrates the importance given by the Government to mainstream DRRM in the development processes to better prepare for and lessen the impact of deadly and costly natural and man-made hazards/disasters with the goal of promoting sustainable socio-economic growth.

	

Of the amount appropriated for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (NDRRM Fund), thirty percent (30%) shall be allocated as Quick Response Fund (QRF) or stand-by fund for relief and recovery programs in order that situation and living conditions of people in communities or areas stricken by disasters, calamities, epidemics, or complex emergencies, may be normalized as quickly as possible. (Section 22 (c) of RA No. 10121)

	

COA Circular 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 provides the “Accounting and Reporting Guidelines on the receipt and utilization of National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (NDRRMF), cash and in-kind aids/donations from local and foreign sources, and funds allocated from the agency regular budget for Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) program.”

	

	Of the total DRRM fund and QRF received by various DA offices in CY 2020 amounting to ₱3,495.255 million, the amount of ₱3,153.998 million or 90.24 percent was obligated. Of the total obligations of ₱3,153.998 million, ₱1,894.17 million or 60.06 percent was disbursed during the year. Summary of allotment received, obligations and disbursements are presented below:

	The DA-CO originally received allotments amounting to ₱1,500.000 million each for NDRRM (Calamity Fund) and QRF in which the amount of ₱1,499.998 million and ₱1,500.000 million, respectively, were sub-allotted to various DA-RFOs.



	However, deficiencies in the utilization of DRRM Fund and QRF were observed in the following offices:



	Office

	Deficiencies

	RFO IVA

--		Payments for the supply and delivery of various livestock, crops, medicines, supplies, machinery, equipment, and fertilizers under various banner programs amounting to P376,308,800.30 sourced from the Quick Response Fund (QRF) were not supported with a duly signed master list of farmer-beneficiaries or other end-user acknowledging receipts

	RFO X

--		Failed to submit Report on the Receipt and Utilization of the DRRMF sourced from GAA for FY 2020 and Report on the Receipt and Utilization of Cash Donations, if applicable, on the 5th day following the end of each month to the Office of the Auditor

--		Procured and donated supplies, materials, equipment and relief goods,  if any, using DRRMF sourced from GAA and cash donations from local and foreign sources were not reported with particularity in the FS and the RPCPPE

	RFO XI

--		Non-submission of Report on the Receipt and Utilization of DRRMF

--		No report was also published in the Agency’s website being the implementing agency.



	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct concerned officers of:



a)		RFO IVA to coordinate with the LGU to collect the master list with the signature of individual farmer-beneficiaries to facilitate validation by the Audit Team, otherwise limit the assistance to be provided to the LGU or other partners in the future;



b)		RFO X to (i) submit strictly the Report on the Receipt and Utilization of the DRRMF sourced from GAA and Report on the Receipt and Utilization of Cash Donations, if any, on the 5th day following the end of each month to the Office of the Auditor; and (ii) instruct the PSPU to prepare and maintain an inventory list of all procured and donated items based on the updated Stock Cards and Property Cards as prescribed in Item VI of COA Circular No. 2014-02 on the Inventory and Monitoring of all Procured and Donated Supplies, Materials, Equipment and Relief Goods; and



c)		RFO XI to (i) provide/furnish the office of the Auditor report on the receipt and utilization of funds as prescribed in Annex H of COA Circular No. 2014-002; and (ii) publish/ post the reports of receipt and utilization of DRRMF in the Agency’s official websites being an implementing agency for transparency and in consonance with COA Circular No. 2014-002.



Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges 



			22)		Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges during the year and in prior years amounted to ₱1,330.665 million and ₱10,506.093 million, respectively or a total of ₱11,836.758 million, of which only ₱2,382.722 million or 20.13 percent were settled during the year, leaving unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges amounting to ₱9,454.036 million as of the end of the year.



The 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) provides the following:



							a)	Notice of Suspension (NS) shall be issued for transactions of doubtful legality/propriety/regularity which may result to pecuniary loss of the government, and which will be disallowed in audit if not satisfactorily explained or validly justified by the parties concerned. This shall be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the NS; otherwise the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged after the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate.



							b)	Notice of Disallowance (ND) shall be issued for transactions which are irregular/unnecessary/excessive and extravagant as defined in COA Circular No. 85-55A as well as other COA issuances, and those which are illegal and unconscionable. This shall be settled within six (6) months from receipt of the ND by the persons liable.



							c)	Notice of Charge (NC) shall be issued if the amount assessed/appraised, amount billed and amount collected is less than what is due to the government, the difference shall be a proper audit charge. This shall be settled within six months from the date of receipt.



							d)	The Auditor shall issue the Notice of Settlement of Suspension/Disallowance/ Charge (NSSDC) whenever a suspension/disallowance or charge is settled.

 

The total unsettled audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in the audit of various transactions as of December 31, 2020, is ₱9,454.036 million based on the NSs, NDs, NCs and NSSDCs issued, as summarized in the following tables:

The accumulation of outstanding balances reflects the Management’s leniency or laxity in the enforcement of the rules and regulations on the settlement of disallowances and charges pursuant to the 2009 RRSA. The low settlement of disallowances deprived the government of the productive use of the unrefunded amounts.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned offices to:



a)	comply with laws, rules and regulations to avoid audit suspensions, disallowances and charges;



b)	continue monitor the settlement of all suspensions, disallowances and charges and to record disallowances with issued NFDs pursuant to the Revised RRSA;



c)	require the Chief Accountant to send demand letters to the persons liable and responsible for the settlement of audit disallowances that have attained finality, and compliance with the requirements of audit suspensions issued; and



d)	require those persons liable with NDs that are final and executory to refund, in full, the amount due from them, and in case they opt to settle on installment basis, strictly comply with COA Resolution 2017-021 relative to the rules and regulation in the settlement of disallowance.



C)	Compliance Audit of the COVID-19 Funds



	Receipt, utilization and disbursement of funds



			23)		Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation under the Bayanihan I and II for COVID-19 initiatives of ₱24,842.138 million is 91.89 percent compared to its allotment of ₱27,0354.97 million with unobligated amount of ₱2,192.83 million due to the delays in the procurement process, non-implementation of projects due to unavailability of seeds and late release of funds.  



	Section 1 of EO No. 91, s. 2019 states:



	a)		All authorized appropriations shall be available for obligation and disbursement only until the end of fiscal year (FY);



	b)		Obligations incurred by the National Government within each FY shall be implemented during the same FY. Goods and services corresponding to said obligations shall be delivered or rendered, inspected and accepted by the end of each FY.



	Section 60 of the General provisions of RA No. 11465 provides that after the end of the validity period, all unreleased appropriations shall lapse, while unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund in accordance with Section 20, Chapter 4, Book VI of EO 292 and shall not thereafter be available for expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. 



	The DA received a total allotment amounting to ₱27,034.968 million from the DBM under the Bayanihan I and II for COVID19 initiatives, of which ₱24,842.138 million or 91.89 percent was utilized/obligated by the DA Offices with disbursements amounting to ₱13,196.564 million, as follows:

Note: RFOs 1, V, VII ans IX MLs not yet submitted.  Amount of allotment, obligation and disbursement not included. 



	The low and/or non-utilization in full of the respective allotments are as follows:



Office

Reasons

DA-CO

Allotment of ₱35.79 million for the Rice Resiliency Program under the Bayanihan I has expired on December 31, 2020 due to unavailability of inbred certified seeds, thus, the objective of the program to produce more rice and increase sufficiency in Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform – Bangsa Moro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (MAFAR-BARMM) was not achieved.



COVID-19 funds for Bayanihan II were not utilized or obligated during the year as the procurement process has not yet started due to time constraints in the preparation of documents. 

BAI

Failed biddings for the MOOE and Capital Outlays as no suppliers attended and submitted bid proposals, and the reconstruction of the Purchase Request. 

BAR

Procurement activities of the Agriculture Stimulus Package started in CY 2021. 

ATI

Advice for Sub-Allotment (ASA) for the NLP, NHVCDP and Digital Agriculture under Bayanihan Act Two were received only by ATI in November 2020 and the corresponding Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) was not yet released as of December 31, 2020. 

RFO X

The remaining funds for Bayanihan Two will be fully utilized on or before June 30, 2021 considering that the funds were received from DA Central Office from October 29 to December 10, 2020. 

RFO XI

Delayed implementation of Programs/Activities/Projects (PAPs) due to (1) failed biddings and/or unforeseen events brought by the pandemic and (2) delayed receipt of NCAs.



Refocusing of GAA 2020 to fund the Ahon-Lahat Pagkain Sapat (ALPAS)  Kontra COVID took some time to be finalized as it had to go through the appropriate process of realignment, hence, the delay, leading to its low utilization.

RFO XIII

Delay in the receipt of Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) and Advice Sub-Allotment (ASA) delayed the procurement process undertaken by the Agency and hindered the delivery of services urgently needed by the general public.



	 The low disbursements compared to obligation was due to the following:



Office

Reasons

DA CO

The ₱5 billion intended for the Farm to Market Road (FMR) was only obligated in CY 2020 but not yet transferred to the DPWH as at year end.

BAFE

The amount of ₱5 million was obligated but not yet disbursed/transferred as at year end.

RFO CAR

Low disbursement rates as the obligated funds still to be disbursed in CY 2021. 



	The fund utilization in RFOs and attached Bureaus were reported in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. However, lapses in the utilization of funds were noted as follows:



				a)	Lapses in obligations



Office

Observations

BSWM

Non-submission of Certificate of Availability of Fund (CAF) before entering into a contract, contrary to Section 37 of GAM for NGAs Vol. 1 - ₱108,757,500.00

BAR

Obligations

Out of the 14 copies of the MOA received, five (5) MOAs had project duration of two (2) years, while the rest, one (1) year. This is not in conformity with the goal of the cash budgeting system of speeding up the implementation of programs and the prompt delivery of goods and services. 



	a)	Lapses in disbursements



Office

Observations

BSWM

Transactions obligated in October 2020 still unpaid as of end of 2020 - ₱3,067,785.00



Management commented that the agricultural supplies delivered by suppliers were on-site and it took more than a week for the pertinent documents to arrive at the office. Also, there were other necessary documents needed from the end-user in order to process the said payments.

RFO II

Packaging of the delivered items of urea fertilizers did not conform to the specifications provided in the related Purchase Order, such as DA-Official Logo were not printed in the sack. Instead, it was packed with the Universal Harvester, Inc.’s logo. Likewise, “NOT FOR SALE” was not printed on the sack.

	We recommended and Management agreed to:



				a)	ensure the attainment of the purpose for which the said funds were received to prevent the expiration of allotment and the reversion of unexpended obligations;

			

				b)	fast track the implementation and completion of programs, projects and activities, optimize fund, disbursement and cash utilization to ensure delivery of goods and services to the intended beneficiaries; and



				c)	accomplish the Approved Program of Work and Project Expenditures or Estimated Expenses indicating the project objectives and expected output and other details.



 Procurement of fertilizer, seeds and other agricultural products



			24)		Procurement of various goods and services of seven DA offices with 31 POs amounting to ₱1,004.970 million were in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law) and GPPB Resolution No. 2020-001, from preparation of project requirements to award of contract. However, procurement contracts amounting to ₱2,075.653 million of nine DA Offices were processed, approved and awarded to various suppliers/consultants/contractors despite lacking supporting documents required under Section 3.6 of GPPB Resolution No. 2020-001.

	

	GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020 provides for the Guidelines for Emergency Procurement under RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.

	Hereunder are the comments of Management on the above observations:

	

	Office

	Comments

	RFO CAR 

	Management commented that they are cautious in the procurement, wherein the use of competitive bidding was made for projects whose timelines are still manageable and within the scheduled periods.

	RFO XIII

	The BAC Secretariat stressed that even though these were not posted on the GPPB portal, the procurements were posted in the PhilGEPS instead. Small-value procurement below P50,000.00 were not posted both on the portal and the PhilGEPS.

	ATI CAR

While Management is aware of DA MC No. 12 and GPPB Circular 01-2020, competitive bidding was used in the procurement of the livestock because ATI’s mandated training and extension do not include the procurement of inputs as a “stand-alone” activity. These inputs, which are deemed “starter kits,” are attached to training and extension interventions.



	ATI’s training and extension interventions with starter kits are not considered as an “emergency case” because it relates to the agency’s mandate on food security that even without the Bayanihan Act, ATI would still need to procure the items. As such, the Circulars apply more to other DA operating units.

	ATI RTC IVB

	Thru the Bids and Awards Committee, Management will be more vigilant on all of their procurement, regardless of modality and they will be more conversant on all related GPPB circulars along with other laws, rules and regulations especially this time of pandemic or state of emergency. Before approval or contract execution, the BAC ensured to review all supporting documents and its compliance to the Revised IRR of the R.A. No. 9184

	

	Also, the BAC ensure that all procurement shall be in accordance with an approved and submitted APP and if there will be any revisions or changes during the year, a revised APP was prepared and submitted to the GPPB in accordance with the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and other related GPPB issuances. Rigorous trainings on the procurement processes and procurement law will also be prioritized this CY 2021 in order to enhance the skills of those involved in the agency’s procurement process.

	ATI RTC XIII

	Management agreed to strictly adhere to the rules and regulations under GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 and immediately submit the lacking required documents. The recommendation will be implemented on the remaining unsubmitted vouchers in order to give reasonable assurance on the eligibility of the supplier/s.

	

	In DA CO, submission of contracts amounting to ₱1,791.334 million were delayed by 14 days and the cost breakdown of the approved budget for the contract was not submitted and inconsistency on the application of incidental cost that resulted to increase of price, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-01.

	

	Management commented that although ECQ and MECQ were lifted on June 1, 2020, the work assignment in the Department was set at 50% work force or lesser. Considering the sensitivity of the documents, documents are entrusted to personnel who are involved in the procurement process. As such, photocopying of documents and ensuring the submission can only be done at the same schedule those personnel were required to physically report for work.

	

	Non-compliance with the supporting documents as provided under GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 casts doubt on the regularity and propriety of the transactions pertaining to the procurement of COVID-19 related expenses. 



	The lack of seed result analysis and the non-conformance to the standard period of examination required by the DA memorandum as well as the non-inclusion of warranty clause in the orders affected the assurance on the quality of the seeds procured.  Also, the lack of NOA posting to the GPPB online portal hindered the attainment of transparency of procurement.



	Hence, the validity and regularity of the procurement conducted cannot be ascertained due to the non-submission of the required documents. 	



	We recommended and Management agreed to:

a)	require the Procurement Officer to submit the completed PO/contracts and supporting documents in accordance with the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and GPPB Circular No. 01-2020;



b)	instruct the Bids and Awards Committee to carefully review the appropriateness of mode of procurement before commencing with procurement and strictly adhere to the rules and procedures prescribed in the Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 and other GPPB issuances especially in relation to alternative modes of procurement; and



c)	use negotiated procurement (emergency cases) whenever applicable, in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and other related GPPB issuances.

	

	Distribution of fertilizers and seeds and other agricultural products

	

			25)		Five DA offices distributed to beneficiaries the assorted vegetable seeds and livestock amounting to ₱37.471 million, while the distribution of seeds, fertilizers, livestock and feeds in seven DA offices amounting to ₱1,019.499 million were not compliant with DA Memorandum Order (MO) Nos. 19 and 31, series of 2020, Items A and B.II of DA MC No. 26, series of 2020, DA MC No. 12 s. 2020, and DA MO No. 52.

	The lack or non-submission of the required documents precluded the audit team to verify the reliability of the distribution of agricultural inputs to qualified recipients and that the quantity of seeds and fertilizers distributed correspond to the rice area of the farmer-beneficiaries.

	

	Also, the delayed/non-distribution of the animal stocks and inputs (such as feeds, etc.) did not only defeat the objectives of the project but it also deprived the intended beneficiaries of the optimum benefits of the project.



	We recommended and Management agreed to:



1)	submit the identified lacking documents in consonance with various DA Memoranda and Circulars for validation;



2)	comply with the requirements set forth in the implementation of programs/projects/activities in accordance with the provisions of the approved guidelines; and

			26)		Reimbursements of claims for fertilizer, as provided under DA-Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 04 and DA MO No. 31, were not complied with, which resulted in the: a) overpayment of fertilizer reimbursement amounting to ₱214.894 million; b) unreliability of reimbursement of ₱0.963 million; and c) low reimbursement in RFO XIII. 

	

	Item 10.2 of the DA-DBP JMC No. 04 requires that the DA shall provide reimbursement claims on a per hectare basis equivalent to two or three bags of urea fertilizers procured/sourced by eligible rice farmers-beneficiaries as supported by valid official receipts/sales invoices, provided that the price indicated on the proof of purchase is equal or lower than the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (provincial/national) monitored average price of urea fertilizer, with the following conditions:

	

a)	should the FPA monitored provincial price of 50-kg urea fertilizer be higher than the FPA monitored national price, the farmer-beneficiaries can reimburse the maximum amount of ₱1,037.46 per bag;



b)	should the acquisition cost be lower than or equal to the monitored provincial price, the DA shall reimburse the actual cost to the eligible farmer beneficiaries per 50 kg bag of urea fertilizer;



c)	should the acquisition cost fall between the monitored provincial and national average price of urea fertilizer, the DA shall reimburse the amount equal to the monitored provincial price to the eligible farmer beneficiaries;



d)	should the acquisition cost be higher than the national average monitored price and the provincial monitored price, the DA shall reimburse the amount of ₱1,037.46 per 50 kg bag of urea fertilizer to the eligible farmer beneficiaries; and



e)	in case the farmer beneficiary presented various proof of purchases, from various entities, various unit prices of for any combination thereof, the proof of purchase shall be compared individually against the national and provincial prices in accordance with the previous provisions. For farmer beneficiaries with various receipts containing different unit prices of 50 kg urea fertilizer, the DA shall reimburse the amount with the lowest acquisition cost and if applicable, the next lower acquisition cost.



	Section 10.3 of DA-DBP JMC No. 04 provides that in case the farmer beneficiary presented various proofs of purchases, from various entities, various unit prices or for any combination thereof, the proof of purchase shall be compared individually against the national and provincial averages in accordance with previous provisions.



	For farmer beneficiaries with various receipts containing different unit prices of 50-kg urea fertilizer, the DA shall reimburse the amount with the lowest cost and, if applicable, the next lower acquisition cost.

	Section 11.1.2.5 of DA DBP JMC No. 04 also provides that DA- Information and Communications and Technology Service (DA-ICTS) shall return the list of rice farmer beneficiaries in case of missing, incorrect, or wrong entries.



	DA MO No. 31 dated June 35, 2020 provides the following:

	

 Section 1	The general master list of rice farmers prepared by the office of the Municipal/City Agriculturist (MA/CA) including their rice hectarage shall be used as reference



Section IV	All rice farmers in the master list shall buy/source out the urea fertilizer requirement for their farm, which should not be less than the volume prescribed per hectare by the program. Farmer beneficiaries shall buy fertilizers from dealers accredited by the FPA and demand a valid BIR registered sales invoices/official receipts to be presented during the reimbursement of fertilizer support as proof of purchase.



Section V	The amount to be reimbursed by the farmer beneficiaries will be based on the actual acquisition cost of fertilizers as shown in the sales invoices/receipt.

	

	a)	Overpayment of fertilizer reimbursement- ₱214.894 million



	Review of the transaction file submitted by the DA-ICTS to the DBP showed that there were overpayments of fertilizer assistance amounting to ₱212,715,746.00 due to (a) payment to unqualified beneficiaries; and (b) erroneous computation caused by the (i) misapplication of the unit price of fertilizers monitored by the FPA; (ii) error in the number of bags used and (iii) error in the unit price and number of bags used in the computation of reimbursement, summarized as follows:

	----media/image1.tiff----

	The details of errors are discussed below:



a)	Inquiry with the RFOs relative to the overpayment of fertilizer reimbursement disclosed the following:



RFO

Comments

DA-CO

The Rice Resiliency Project Focal person bares that in order that the beneficiary will be qualified for reimbursement, the farmer beneficiary will have to procure the required or more than the required number of bags of fertilizer in accordance with the area planted. However, if the procured number of bags of fertilizer is lesser than the required number of bags of fertilizer per area planted the farmer will not be entitled for reimbursement, hence, non-compliance with the required number of bags to be procured per area planted per sub project.

I

The procurement of inorganic fertilizer in addition to the urea procured was approved by the DA Secretary. The total number of bags provided in the master list submitted to the DA-ICTS was already the total fertilizer required by the farmers to satisfy or procure in order to qualify under the program.

II

The counterparts of the farmer beneficiaries are already included in the submitted master list  to the DA-ICTS.

IVB

There were 5% of number of farmers whose number of fertilizer bags are not equal to the number of bags required. The DA computed the reimbursement based on the actual of bags procured. The required number of bags are not equal to the procured bags is due to the receipts presented by the farmers. There are receipts presented that were not honored as valid and not counted. Receipts were considered as proof of fertilizer usage but no eligible for reimbursement purpose. 

V

All farmers included in the list for reimbursement complied with the necessary number of bags for the buy portion counterpart of the farmer. No farmer was able to claim reimbursement with the lack of required volume of fertilizer procured. 

VIII

Correction of entries were made and submitted the corrected transaction file for the 12 beneficiaries for the province of Southern Leyte.

IX

Farmers availed of the reimbursement by purchasing the required number of bags of fertilizer based on the approved guidelines with no assistance from the LGU/private sector led programs.

X

Deviation in the General Guidelines for the implementation of the Fertilizer Reimbursement Scheme for the RRP was approved by the DA Secretary wherein farmers who have purchased non-organic fertilizers prior to the issuance of DA RFO 10 MO No. 103 (Supplemental guidelines in the implementation of RRP) also qualified for the fertilizer assistance. Farer beneficiaries are recommended to purchase 4 bags of urea fertilizer for inbred rice and 5 bags if urea for hybrid rice.

XI

Strictly followed the reimbursement scheme on the release of claims to the farmer beneficiaries as stated in the MO Nos. 31,34 for which the farmers can only claim reimbursement given the required volume of fertilizer (no. of bags) procured.  Farmer beneficiaries did not source out or avail the fertilizers from LGU/private led programs to complete the requirements. 

XII

Pursuant to RRP I guidelines, farmers should procure a total of 4 bags of urea fertilizer and 5 bags urea fertilizer intended for one-hectare farm land devoted to inbred and hybrid rice farm, respectively, as follows:

Particulars

Counterpart per Hectare

For reimbursement in favor of the farmer

Inbred

2 bags urea fertilizer

2 bags urea fertilizer

Hybrid

2 bags urea fertilizer

3 bags urea fertilizer

Such submission contained the items which forms part of their counterpart as well as those to be reimbursed in their favor. 

XIII

Twenty-five percent (25%) or 2,572 farmers were able to receive the fertilizer reimbursement despite lacking requirement due to the following:

--	Lack of financial capability of the farmers to buy the required equity of fertilizer as farmer’s equity.

--	Some of the farmers prioritized to purchase the refundable urea fertilizer and submitted the necessary documents and hoping for possible reimbursement.

--	Less submission of farmer’s master list from the municipalities due to on-going RSBSA enrolment and lockdown protocols in some LGUs despite of impending deadline of submission pronounced by the NRP.



b)	The reimbursement scheme in RFO XII as provided was not in accordance with the JMC 04. For one-hectare hybrid rice production, the required number of bags of fertilizer to be procured as counterpart of the farmer is 5 in order to be eligible for reimbursement for 3 bags. There was no mention in the JMC No. 04 for a counterpart of 2 bags and has to reimburse for 3 bags.



--	Reimbursement of the total number of bags procured despite non-compliance with the required number of bags of fertilizer

a)	Reimbursement based on the number of bags procured instead of the required number of bags prescribed in the DA-DBP JMC No. 04.

b)	Amendments issued by RFOs I, VIII, X and XIII were already incorporated in the computation for the reimbursement of fertilizer.

		i)	RFO I - the procurement of inorganic fertilizer in addition to the urea procured was already included in the master list

		ii)	RFO VIII - submitted the corrected copy of master list 

		iii)	RFO X - on the combination of inorganic and urea fertilizers allowed as the total fertilizer procured and submitted an updated copy of the list

		iv)	RFO XIII - submitted an updated master list.

c)	Inquiry with Management disclosed that the total number of bags provided in the master list submitted by RFO I to DA-ICTS was already the total fertilizer required to the farmers under the program.



--	The unit cost of fertilizer exceeded the provincial/national price monitored 

The unit cost of urea fertilizer presented by the farmer beneficiaries was the basis for the reimbursement of urea fertilizers even if the unit cost is higher than the FPA monitored provincial and the national average prices contrary to Item 10.2 of the DA-DBM JC No. 04.

--	Error in the unit price and number of bags used in the computation of reimbursement

a)	the unit price and number of bags used in the computation of reimbursement cannot determined as the total amount of reimbursement divided by the total number of bag as the result does not tally with the unit price indicated. Same true with the total amount divided by the unit price, the total number of bags does not coincide with the total number of bags and there is always a fraction thereto.

b)	The overpayment was computed based on the total number of bags procured multiplied by the unit price and the product thereof was subtracted by the amount indicated in the list.

	The misapplication was the lookout of the RFOs in the preparation of the list of farmer beneficiaries submitted to the ICTS for the preparation of the transaction file submitted to the DPB for payment.

	

	b)	Unreliable reimbursement - ₱0.963 million



	Management’s failure to provide the data on area planted, number of procured fertilizer and the correct information on the number of fertilizer procured as basis in the determination of the total amount to be reimbursed, resulted in the unreliable amount of reimbursement amounting to ₱963,540.22.

i)	Incorrect data on area planted and no data on the number of fertilizers procured - ₱0.328 million

	The transaction file submitted by the DA- ICTS to the DBP and the resubmitted amended list from the RFOs showed that the total reimbursement of ₱328,451.74 to 97 beneficiaries in six RFOs are doubtful due to incorrect data on area planted, non-provision of the number of fertilizer procured and wrong information on fertilizer procured as basis in computing the required fertilizer assistance for reimbursement, as presented below.

	Data on the area planted was vital in the computation of the fertilizer reimbursement as these were used in the determination of the total number of bags of fertilizer to be procured by the beneficiaries and the total number of bags to be reimbursed; however, no data on the area planted was provided in the master list and there were also over 100 hectares of area planted that were included in the list.

	

	Moreover, 7 beneficiaries in Zamboanga Del Norte erroneously filled up the Urea procured column with Official Receipt Nos. instead of number of bags procured which may be due to clerical error.



	The DA-ICTS failed to return the list of rice farmer beneficiaries to the concerned ROs to correct the noted missing, incorrect and wrong entries contrary to the provisions of Item No. 11.1.2.5 of the DA DBP JMC No. 04, thus the transaction/ disbursement files prepared by DA-ICTS and transmitted to DBP for the reimbursement claims by the farmer beneficiaries are unreliable.



	The abovementioned deficiencies precluded the Audit Team from conducting a detailed evaluation/validation of the reimbursement claims.

ii)	Without number of bags for beneficiaries with multiple OR/SI - ₱0.634 million

	The master list of beneficiaries submitted showed that the five RFOs did not specify the number of bags and cost of bags used; and in cases where the farmer beneficiary submitted various proof of purchase, the number of bags procured and its corresponding cost for each OR was not provided, thus affecting the reliability of the reimbursed amount of ₱634,088.48.

	c)	Low reimbursement rate of the target in RFO XIII



	Reimbursement of fertilizers in RFO XIII is in accordance with DA Memorandum 19 and DA-DBP JMC No. 04.  However, the amount of fertilizer reimbursed was only 26 percent of the total regional target. Details as follows:

	The low reimbursement rate was due to the following reasons:



	a)	Late amendment of the guidelines from buy one (1) take one (1) to reimbursement scheme;

	b)	Early planters bought fertilizers earlier than the period of March 16, 2020 to September 15, 2020;

	c)	Farmers bought different type of fertilizers such as AmoSul, potash and complete;

	d)	Some farmers either lost their receipts or did not ask for receipts upon purchase of the Urea fertilizer



	Hereunder are the comments of Management on the above observations:

	

	Office

	Comments

	DA-ICTS

	Cleansing and validation process conducted does not cover the checking as to the correctness of entries under amount for payment. The determination of unqualified beneficiaries is beyond the role of the DA-ICTS. The 7 beneficiaries from Zamboanga del Norte received the amount reflected in the original submission. Upon checking, there were clerical errors as the column for urea procured and the receipt column were switched during data processing. DA-ICTS cleaning and validation process conducted does not cover the checking as to the correctness of entries under area planted.

	CAR

Encoding of the area planted on the transaction file was unintentionally missed. Based on the masterlist submitted by the LGU of Tabuk City, Kalinga, Meliza Putao Adatal of Barangay Agbannawag, Tabuk City, Kalinga has an area of .5 hectare planted to inbred seed that determined the number of bags procured for her reimbursement of one (1) bag amounting to ₱918.75.

	I

The forty-one (41) beneficiaries with no data on area planted are those farmers planting both inbred and hybrid seeds, thus in the database provided, they reflected the area on the column “Total Area Planted”.

They also coordinated with the concerned LGU on this matter and the disaggregated data on area planted by seed type was already provided and updated as attachment.

	IV-B

	In Marinduque and Romblon where the area or landholding of farmer beneficiaries are too small, confusion in the conversion of the required fertilizer leads to COA disqualification of farmers. The conversion table indicated that for areas with less than or equal to 0.75 ha the rate of assistance is buy 2 bags get reimbursement of 1 bag. Most of the area in the said provinces fall below 0.25 ha, thus procuring 2 bags would be too much. The farmer instead procured 1 bag and the corresponding reimbursement was also adjusted to 0.5 bag thus, there is also no overpayment

Also, some of the encoders have not paid attention to the number of fertilizers required and just encoded the actual number of bags procured to be the same with the number of bags required. Still, the basis of the remittance amount was on the bags procured and there was no overpayment. There are some entries where the total area planted is greater than the equivalent seeds received. This is a case where the farmers have areas outside of the program and were included in the listing of the total area planted. However, the computation for the voucher remittance amount remained to be based only on the seeds received under the program thus no overpayment was committed. Typographical errors were also noted, i.e., 20 hectares instead of 2.0; 27 bags instead of 37 bags, but the corresponding fertilizer requirement remained to be based on the seeds received from the program.

	XIII

	The computation for the unit price of inbred (3 bags/ha instead of 2 bags/ha) and hybrid (2 bags/ha instead of 3 bags/ha) was interchanged.



	In effect, timely assistance and optimum benefits that could have been derived therefrom did not redound to the intended farmer beneficiaries.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the RFO Project Coordinators to:



a)	strictly comply with the provisions of Item 10.2 of the DA DBP JMC No. 04 in applying the unit price of fertilizer to avoid overpayment of the fertilizer assistance to farmer beneficiaries;



b)	explain the reimbursement of fertilizer to unqualified beneficiaries and in excess of the national/provincial price monitored for the month of June 2020;



c)	update the master list to include the correct needed data for the determination of the total amount to be reimbursed;

	

d)		strictly comply with the provisions of Item 10.2 of the DA DBP JMC No. 04 in applying the unit price of fertilizer and number of bags to be reimbursed to avoid overpayment of the fertilizer assistance to farmer beneficiaries.; and



e)	determine the extent of liability of personnel responsible for the overpayment of fertilizers and impose sanctions if warranted.



			27)		Total reported number of beneficiaries that had claimed reimbursement of fertilizer assistance with the DBP exceeded the total number of beneficiaries listed in the master list submitted by the DA-ICTS to the DBP for reimbursement by 729 beneficiaries, in contrast with the provisions of DA MO No. 31 and DA DBP JMC No. 04.

	

	DA MO No. 31 and DA DBP JMC 04 provide the following:

	

Section

Provision

I of DA MO 31

11.1.2.1 of DA DBP JMC 04

The general master list of rice farmers prepared by the Office of the Municipal/City Agriculturist (MA/CA) indicating the rice hectarage shall be used as reference. The said masterlist shall be duly certified by MLGUs thru MA/CA and validated by the PLGU thru the Provincial Agriculturist  to be submitted to the DA RFO 

II of DA MO 31

The DA RFOs shall cross check the master list with the RSBSA to determine the registered farmers. DA RFOs will provide top the concerned LGUs through MA/CA office the list if farmers not in the RSBSA for further validation/confirmation and registration in the RSBSA. 

VIII of DA MO 31

DA RFOs shall endorse the verified list of farmer beneficiaries to the DA-ICTS for processing of assistance 

X  of DA MO 31

DA-ICTS through FOS shall endorse to the GFI the list of farmers/coops with the corresponding unique transaction reference numbers. 

B.3 of DA MO 31

11.2.4.1 of DA DBP JMC 04

Execute the payment request from DA immediately within 5 WDs upon receipt of transmission provided that there is sufficient funding to cover the related payment instruction of the RRP Fund account. 

B.4 of DA MO 3111.2.4.3 of DA DBP JMC 04)

Allow the payment of assistance claims to RRP beneficiaries through the Bank’s authorized payout outlets. 

	

	Verification of the DBP liquidation report submitted to the DA Accounting Division as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that total number of farmer beneficiaries paid by the bank exceeded the total number of beneficiaries listed in the master list by 729 farmer beneficiaries, as follows

	----media/image2.emf----

	It was noted that there were 24,925 farmer beneficiaries in Occidental Mindoro who have claimed reimbursement from the DBP while there were only 24,633 beneficiaries reported in the master list submitted by the DA-ICTS to the DBP consisting of 24,345 single individuals and 288 beneficiaries under Farmers’ Cooperative Association (FCA), thus a with a difference of 292.



	The farmer beneficiaries who have claimed reimbursement that were not included in the master list cannot be determined by the Audit Team since it was only the summary report on the total number of beneficiaries and total amount paid was provided by the DBP contrary to Section 11.2.7.3 of the DA DBP JMC No. 04 which states that the DBP to issue a certified true copy of liquidation certification within 15 calendar days after submission of liquidation documents (e.g. List of Paid and Unpaid beneficiaries).

	

	Likewise, the determination of the farmer beneficiaries paid thru the FCA cannot be determined because there was no detailed list of beneficiaries included in the payment thru FCA as required in Section 10.7.1 of the DA – DBP JMC No. 04.



	It was only the date of payment, FCA account number, amount paid and the name of the FCA that were provided in the report submitted, hence, the determination of the list of farmer beneficiaries who have claimed reimbursement thru the FCAs cannot be made, contrary to the provisions of Section 11.2.7.3 of the same JMC.



	In addition, there were 42,328 farmer beneficiaries (individual and FCA accounts) from 19 provinces in eight regions that have not yet claimed their reimbursement for fertilizer assistance as of December 31, 2020.   The presence of huge number of beneficiaries who have not yet claimed their reimbursement as of December 31, 2020 may be considered as dormant accounts and will be reverted by DBP subject to fees and other regulations as provided in Section 11.2.8 of the DA DBP JMC No. 04.



	The reimbursement of fertilizer assistance to beneficiaries more than the total number of beneficiaries listed in the master list and the undetermined number of farmer beneficiaries who have claimed reimbursement thru FCAs cast doubt on the reliability and accuracy of the master list submitted by the RFO to the DA-ICTS and endorsed to DBP for payment.



	We recommended that Management:

	

a)		reconcile the number of beneficiaries paid by the DBP in excess of the total number of beneficiaries listed in the master list submitted by the DA-ICTS to the bank for the reimbursement of fertilizer assistance; and

	

b)		require the concerned FCAs to submit the detailed list of beneficiaries paid thru the Farmers’ Cooperative to determine to total number of unclaimed accounts that might be considered as dormant as required under Section 11.2.7.3 of the DA-DBP JMC No. 04.

	

A)	Cash and Food Subsidy to Marginalized Farmers and Fisher folks (CFSMFF)

			28)		Laxity in the reporting of farmer beneficiaries in the mater list submitted to the DBP resulted in the over remittance of payroll amounting to ₱35.831 million caused by the 7,146 beneficiaries that were reported two or three times, contrary to DA-BFAR-PCA-SRA-NCIP-DBP JMC No. 06. On the other hand, farmer beneficiaries totaling 1,317 who have claimed the ₱3,000.00 financial assistance were not included in the master list submitted by the DA-ICTS to the DBP.

	The responsibilities of the Implementing Agencies (IAs) and DA RFOs was clearly stipulated in the JMC No. 06 that a validated list will be submitted to the DA-ICTS for the preparation of reference and claim code for submission to DBP.

	

	However, despite the validation and the certification issued by the IAs and RFOs on the list of beneficiaries, the list submitted by the DA-ICTS to DBP for payment of the financial and food assistance still included duplicate names of beneficiaries, thus resulted in the over remittance of ₱35,831,000.00 to the DBP for the cash and food subsidy to marginal farmers and fisher folks.

	

	Management commented thru the DA- Field Operations Service (FOS) that the submission of the list of qualified beneficiaries for deduplication to the DA-ICTS is the direct responsibility of the IAs and the RFOs. While there is strict observance of the process, the duplication system/software of the DA-ICTS, in some cases, is unable to detect duplicates resulting in duplication. Instructions were made to IAs and RFOs to sternly and on best efforts, double check all vouchers before releasing them to the beneficiaries.  There was no double release of assistance even to doubly listed beneficiaries.

	

	The Audit Team opined that although there is no double release of assistance to the double listed beneficiaries, the payroll submitted to the bank was overstated, and the doubly listed beneficiaries could have been replaced with eligible and qualified beneficiaries.



	On the other hand, farmer beneficiaries totaling 1,317 who have claimed the ₱3,000.00 financial assistance were not included in the master list submitted by the DA-ICTS to the DBP.

	

	The claimed transaction reports of DBP as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that there were 1,317 beneficiaries that claimed the cash grant of ₱3,000.00 amounting to ₱3,951,000.00 that were not found in the master list of beneficiaries submitted by the DA-ICTS to DBP, summarized as follows:

	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	thoroughly check the masterlist of beneficiaries prior to the certification and submission to the DA to avoid double reporting of beneficiaries which result to the over statement of the payroll submitted to the bank; and



b)	determine the extent of liability of personnel responsible for the over remittance of the cash and financial assistance for possible imposition of sanctions.

	

c)	reconcile the beneficiaries who have claimed financial grants from the DBP with the master list provided by the Implementing Agencies and submitted to the DA-ICTS and to the DBP for payment; and 



d)	determine the cause/s why payment was made to beneficiaries not included in the master list.



B)	Financial Subsidy for Rice Farmers (FSRF)

			29)		Leniency in the reporting of farmer beneficiaries in the master list submitted to the LBP resulted in the over remittance of payroll caused by the 6,912 beneficiaries that were reported two or three times, contrary to Section II.6.5.5 of the DA-LBP JMC No. 01, resulting in the over remittance of financial subsidy amounting to ₱35,640,000.00. In addition, the failure of the LBP to render liquidation reports as prescribe in the DA-LBP-DBP JMC No. 16 and in the MOA resulted in the non-validation of the total number of beneficiaries who have claimed financial assistance.

	The responsibility of the RFOs is to identify, endorse, and submit the list of farmer beneficiaries to the DA-ICTS who in return will accept the approved list for safekeeping, deduping and data archiving. The list will be returned to the concerned RFOs in case of missing, incorrect or wrong entries for correction since the DA-ICTS are not allowed to make any corrections.

	

	The corrected list will be resubmitted by the concerned RFO to the DA-ICTS for the preparation and submission of the batch opening file in LBP’s format for the card enrolment with the LBP.



	However, despite the cleaning, correction of errors in the list of beneficiaries by the RFOs, the payroll files submitted by the DA-ICTS to the LBP still included the names of beneficiaries that are listed twice or thrice, thus resulted in the over remittance of ₱35,640,000.00 for the financial subsidy of beneficiaries to the LBP.

	

	Moreover, review of the master list and payroll files submitted by the DA-ICTS to the LBP for the preparation of LBP cash/Prepaid card payment revealed that farm size of the farmer beneficiaries were not provided in the master list/payroll file. Only the following information were provided:

	

i)	Name of beneficiary

ii)	Province

iii)	Municipality

iv)	Amount

v)	Date submitted 

vi)	Batch number 

vii)	Remarks



	Without the required farm size, we cannot validate if the farmer beneficiaries were qualified for the financial assistance of ₱5,000.00 paid thru Cash/Prepaid Cards.



	In addition, the failure of the LBP to render liquidation reports as prescribe in the DA-LBP-DBP JMC No. 16 and in the MOA resulted in the non-validation of the total number of beneficiaries who have claimed financial assistance.



	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	explain the inclusion of 6,912 beneficiaries that were reported two or three times in the list of farmer beneficiaries;



b)	instruct the concerned RFOs and DA-ICTS to ensure that the list of beneficiaries is properly reviewed to remit the correct amount of financial subsidy to LBP;



c)	provide information on the farm size of the area planted to determine whether the farmer beneficiaries are qualified for the financial assistance in accordance with the provisions of DA LBP JMC 01; and



d)	require the LBP to submit liquidation reports as prescribe in the DA-LBP-DBP JMC No. 16 and in the MOA.



			30)		The accuracy of the farmers’ data base could not be relied upon due to the assignment of multiple RSBSA numbers to a single farmer beneficiary and /or the assignment of RSBSA number to two or more farmer beneficiaries.



	RA No. 8435 or the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 mandates the creation of a National Information Network (NIN) that shall be set up from the Department level down to the regional, provincial and municipal offices.

	

	The NIN shall link the various research institutions for easy access to data on agriculture and fisheries research and technology and that all departments, agencies, Bureaus, research institutions and LGUs shall consolidate and continuously update all relevant information and data on a periodic basis including basic sectors in agriculture registered in the RSBSA of the DA.



	The RSBSA serves as a requirement and basis for providing financial assistance, subsidiary funding and insurance services for farmers and fisher folk such that those registered in the electronic database by government agencies are given priority in the targeting and implementation of their respective programs. Also, it will be used for developing programs and policies for the agriculture and fisheries sectors, and more importantly, as a means to identify farmers and fishermen that should benefit from agriculture-related programs and services of the government.



	The RSBSA showed that 8,210 RSBSA numbers were issued to two or more farmer beneficiaries summarized as follows:

	Verification of the list of beneficiaries disclosed that six provinces/city in Regions IX, X, and XII had issued a single RSBSA number to at least 20 or more farmer beneficiaries.  Examples are RSBSA No. 10-13-21-10 that was issued to 208 farmer beneficiaries and RSBSA No. 10-13-012 issued to 178 beneficiaries in Bukidnon Province. The provinces with at least 20 or more beneficiaries that share the same RSBSA numbers are as follows:

	The above noted deficiency is not in accordance with item 11.1 of the DA-DBP JMC No. 04, to wit:

	

11.1.1.2.2 DA RFO through the RRP Focal person, shall inform farmers and facilitate the updating of the RSBSA to ensure timely submission of the batch enrolment file to the DA-ICTS thru DA-FOS 



11.1.2.3 Office of the RRP Director, in coordination of the DA-FOS, shall collect and store the validated list of rice farmer-beneficiaries in a share goggle drive account



1.1.2.4 DA-ICTS shall receive the approved list of rice farmer beneficiaries for safe keeping, deduping and data archiving purposes



11.1.2.5 DA-ICTS shall return the list of rice farmer beneficiaries to DA RFO in case of missing, incorrect or wrong entries 

	

	The offices responsible for the encoding and updating of the list of farmer beneficiaries enrolled in the RSBSA had remiss their duties to ensure that the RSBSA numbers are issued to individual farmer beneficiaries. As discussed during the meeting with the RFOs, it was mentioned that the RSBSA number system consist of 5 columns, are as follows:

	

----media/image3.emf---- 

	However, the RFOs provided the number system up to the barangay level only and failed to provide the number for the individual beneficiary; thus it resulted in the issuance of a single RSBSA reference number to two or more beneficiaries.

	The non-uniformity in encoding the names and other vital information of the farmer beneficiaries resulted in the duplication of entries, such as: 1) the date of birth encoded as 11/18/1963 was also encoded as 11-18-1963, and 2) the name of the beneficiary was misspelled in the second entry; hence the system recognized the two entries as separate and unique.



	The failure and leniency to properly monitor the issuance of Reference/Control Number by the concerned Officer of the RFO resulted in the assignment of multiple RSBSA numbers to a single farmer beneficiary and /or the assignment of RSBSA number to two or more farmer beneficiaries, thus, the accuracy of the farmers’ data base could not be relied upon.

	

	Management comments:

	Comments

	DA-FOS 

The task of manually assigning the RSBSA reference number is the responsibility of the C/MAO. Management proceeded with the RSBSA updating through paper forms and human error could not be completely avoided resulting in multiple RSBSA numbers assigned to a single farmer and/or assignment of RSBSA number to two or more farmer beneficiaries. 



The paper forms with assigned reference number by the C/MAO  are then encoded at the DA RFO level through the Farmer and Fishers Registration System (FFRS).an automated system generated unique reference number is then linked to the initial paper form reference number afterwards, which serves as the official RSBSA reference number of the registrant.

	DA-ICTS

	The assignment of RSBSA numbers is done by the concerned LGUs and RFOs. The list of farmer beneficiaries submitted to DA-ICTS already has the corresponding RSBSA numbers.  ICTS have exerted all efforts to make certain on following Item II of DA DBP JMC No. 04, return the list of rice farmer beneficiaries to DA RFO in case of missing, incorrect, wrong entries. Concerned RFOs were informed regarding the issuer on the RSBSA duplicate numbering. 

	V

	The master list of qualified farmers submitted by the LGUs were subjected to the process introduced by the DA-ICTS before endorsing the same to the Database Management Division (DMD) ICTS and assumed that by doing so, all duplicates, incorrect entries and other problems have already been sorted rendering our submissions to be accurate and valid. 

	VIII

	Management will coordinate with the LGUs for a more systematic issuance of reference numbers including the validation and checking of submitted registration documents to avoid duplication. Conduct of periodic review of encoded farmers in the FFRS to check for duplicate reference numbers and/or multiple registrations for updating. Reorient assigned personnel in all LGUs relative to the RSBSA registration with emphasis on lessons drawn from previous registration process.  

	XI

	Provincial teams who were doing the profiling of farmers mistakenly assigned RSBSA reference numbers to two or more beneficiaries or there are multiple farmers who shares RSBSA numbers because the   Numbering are done manually by the enumerators on the ground. There are many enumerators from different agencies and LGU offices who are conducting RSBSA profiling at the same barangay and right after the interview, the claim stubs are given directly to the farmers with RSBSA reference numbers already assigned by the enumerator who conducted the interview. Considering the urgency and bulk registration, the sequence of incremental number or the last 6 digits are not perfectly followed. Most of the Municipal Agricultural Offices have no assigned personnel who dedicatedly do the control of numbering because they are also undermanned 

	

	The Audit Team opined that farmer beneficiaries for the various projects under the Bayanihan One and Two namely: 1) Financial Subsidy for Rice Farmers (FSRF) 2) Rice Farmers Fertilizer Assistance (RRFA), and 3) Cash and Financial Subsidy for Marginalized Farmers and Fisher folks (CSFMFF) should be registered with the RSBSA.



	The provisions under the General Guidelines of DA MO No. 31 clearly state the following:



--	The master list of beneficiaries is prepared and certified by the LGUs thru the Municipal/City Agriculture Office (M/CAO) and validated by the provincial agriculturist to be submitted to the DA RFO.



--	The DA RFO shall cross check the master list with the RSBSA to determine the registered farmers. DA RFO will provide the concerned LGU thru the MA/CA office the list of farmers not in the RSBSA for further validation /confirmation and registration in the RSBSA.



--	LGU shall mobilize their agricultural extension workers to register all farmers to the RSBSA.



	The task of the C/MAO is to assign RSBSA reference control numbers in the RSBSA enrollment form and was encoded in the RFO level thru the Farmers and Fishers Registration System. The designated encoders who processed the information at the RFO level should have detected that single RSBSA number was assigned to two or more beneficiaries had the system apps on excel files been applied during the sorting and verification of files.



	Under Item 11.1.2 of DA DBP JMC 04, the DA RFO shall inform farmers and facilitate the updating of the RSBSA to ensure timely submission of the batch enrolment file to DA-ICTS thru DA-FOS.  Thus, in our view, the master list provided by the LGUs thru the MA/CA shall be validated by the DA RFOs for its completeness and accuracy prior to submission to the DA-ICTS for safekeeping, deduping and data archiving purposes. The DA-ICTS shall return the master list to DA RFO in case of missing, incorrect or wrong entries.



	Hence, it was the duty of the DA RFO to ensure that the beneficiaries listed in the RSBSA were provided with a unique RSBSA number. In the case of lack of personnel of the MA/CA, it was clearly stated in the DA MO 31 that the LGU shall utilize their agricultural extension workers to register all farmers to the RSBSA.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed require the concerned Regional Officer to:



a)	properly monitor the issuance of Reference/Control Number to stop the assignment of multiple RSBSA numbers to a single farmer beneficiary and/or the assignment of RSBSA number to two or more farmer beneficiaries; and 



b)	require the RFOs to carefully validate the list and ensure that a unique RSBSA number is assigned to farmer beneficiaries to avoid duplication;
