A)	 Introduction



The Department of Agriculture (DA) is mandated to promote agricultural development by providing the policy framework, public investments, and support services needed for domestic and export-oriented business enterprises. In the fulfillment of its mandate, it shall be the primary concern of the Department to improve farm income and generate work opportunities for farmers, fishermen and other rural workers. It shall encourage people’s participation in agricultural development through sectoral representation in agricultural policy-making bodies so that the policies, plans and programs of the Department are formulated and executed to satisfy their needs. It shall also use a bottom-up self-reliant farm system approach that will emphasize social justice, equity, productivity and sustainability in the use of agricultural resources.----footnote1----

A qualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements due to various accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱2,087.408 million, which exceeded the materiality level of ₱360.581 million and accounting deficiencies such as absence of subsidiary ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on 379 accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱32,362.002 million which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts as shown in detail in Part II of the report.





E)		Significant Observations and Recommendations

Moreover, it registered a utilization rate of 97.86 percent for Provision of Agricultural Equipment and Facilities under Rice Program wherein low utilization of funds was observed in RFO V.

However, the physical assets of 14 DA offices amounting to ₱3,683.049 million were not insured against fire or theft, thus, they are at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage or loss of property. (Observation no. 9)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned officers of:



a)	BAFE, PRDP, ATI, BAI, BSWM, RFOs CAR, I, II, III, IVB, VII, IX, X, and XI to properly insure with the GSIS the physical assets amounting to ₱3,683.049 million and thereabouts; by making proper and timely coordination with the GSIS for the necessary requirements in insuring the agency property; and/or to prepare and submit an updated Property Inventory Form for all insurable assets to the GSIS;

5)	The 67 ODA Funded I-Build and I-Reap Subprojects amounting to ₱2,178.626 million are already beyond the target date of completion thereby delaying the delivery of benefits to the intended recipients. (Observation no. 20)



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to request the Local Chief Executive (LCE) of the 33 proponent LGUs to coordinate with the PSOs on the identified causes of delays to further prevent losses in terms of time and resources which were kept idle to the disadvantage of the intended users.



6)	Procurement of various goods and services of seven DA offices with 31 POs amounting to ₱1,004.970 million were in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law) and GPPB Resolution No. 2020-001, from preparation of project requirements to award of contract. However, procurement contracts amounting to ₱2,075.653 million of nine DA Offices were processed, approved and awarded to various suppliers/consultants/contractors despite lacking supporting documents required under Section 3.6 of GPPB Resolution No. 2020-001. (Observation no. 24)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	require the Procurement Officer to submit the completed PO/contracts and supporting documents in accordance with the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and GPPB Circular No. 01-2020;



b)	instruct the Bids and Awards Committee to carefully review the appropriateness of mode of procurement before commencing with procurement and strictly adhere to the rules and procedures prescribed in the Revised IRR of R.A.

(Observation no. 25)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	submit the identified lacking documents in consonance with various DA Memoranda and Circulars for validation;



b)	comply with the requirements set forth in the implementation of programs/projects/activities in accordance with the provisions of the approved guidelines; and



c)	fast track the procurement of various goods and cause the immediate distribution to corresponding beneficiaries.



8)	Reimbursements of claims for fertilizer, as provided under DA-Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 04   and DA MO No. 31, were not complied with, which resulted in the: a) overpayment of fertilizer reimbursement amounting to ₱214.894 million; b) unreliability of reimbursement of ₱0.963 million; and c) low reimbursement in RFO XIII. (Observation no. 26)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the RFO Project Coordinators to:



a)	strictly comply with the provisions of Item 10.2 of the DA DBP JMC No. 04 in applying the unit price of fertilizer to avoid overpayment of the fertilizer assistance to farmer beneficiaries;

d)	strictly comply with the provisions of Item 10.2 of the DA DBP JMC No. 04 in applying the unit price of fertilizer and number of bags to be reimbursed to avoid overpayment of the fertilizer assistance to farmer beneficiaries.; and



e)	determine the extent of liability of personnel responsible for the overpayment of fertilizers and impose sanctions if warranted.



9)	Laxity in the reporting of farmer beneficiaries in the mater list submitted to the DBP resulted in the over remittance of payroll amounting to ₱35.831 million caused by the 7,146 beneficiaries that were reported two or three times, contrary to DA-BFAR-PCA-SRA-NCIP-DBP JMC No. 06. On the other hand, farmer beneficiaries totaling 1,317 who have claimed the ₱3,000.00 financial assistance were not included in the master list submitted by the DA-ICTS to the DBP. (Observation no. 28)

We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	thoroughly check the masterlist of beneficiaries prior to the certification and submission to the DA to avoid double reporting of beneficiaries which result to the over statement of the payroll submitted to the bank; and



b)	determine the extent of liability of personnel responsible for the over remittance of the cash and financial assistance for possible imposition of sanctions.



c)	reconcile the beneficiaries who have claimed financial grants from the DBP with the master list provided by the Implementing Agencies and submitted to the DA-ICTS and to the DBP for payment; and 



d)	determine the cause/s why payment was made to beneficiaries not included in the master list.
