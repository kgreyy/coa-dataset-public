D.  Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the OMB for CY 2020.  It 

was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 



 iii 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standard of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAI). 

 

 

E.  Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements (FS) of OMB as at December 31, 2020 due to erroneous 

recording of: a) liquidations of CY 2019 cash advances to various expenses in the 

current year instead of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit); b) deposits of collections 

from the refunds of cash advances amounting to ₱659,792.40 to Subsidy from 

National Government instead of Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposits; and c) semi-

expendable properties to Office Supplies Expense and Other Supplies and Material 

Expense instead of the proper semi-expendable property accounts. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the audit observations and recommendations which were 

discussed with Management officials concerned during the exit conference 

conducted on March 26, 2021. Management views and comments were 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. Deficiencies were noted in the liquidation of Cash Advances (CAs) such as: a) 
Liquidation Report (LR) of ₱121,950.00 was not adequately supported with 

pertinent documents, to establish the validity of the expenses incurred and 

submitted after 20 calendar days after the end of the year;  c) expenses incurred in 

prior year amounting to ₱1,150,007.87 were recognized as expenses in current year; 

and d) deposits of collections from refunds of CAs amounting to ₱659,792.40 were 

erroneously recorded as account - Subsidy from National Government instead of  

Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular Account. 

 

We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to:  

 

a) direct the concerned Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) to submit copies of the 
identification cards and accomplishment reports of the porters hired for 

operations conducted in CY 2019 

 

 submit the copies of the government identification cards and 
accomplishment reports of the porters hired for operations conducted in 

CY 2019; and 

 



 iv 

b) henceforth, require the Administrative and Finance Division to continue to 
monitor the liquidation of cash advances. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) require the Chief Accountant to: 
 

 record the deposits of collections of refunds from CAs to the account Cash 
Treasury Deposit – Regular; 

 record expenses of prior year to Accumulated Surplus account; and 
 

b) direct the concerned SDO to utilize CAs solely for the specific purpose for 
which they were granted. 

 

2. Management’s practice of non-recognition of properties with capitalization below 
₱15,000.00 to semi-expendable properties upon receipt of deliveries and recording 

the same as outright Supplies Expense/Supplies and Materials Expense were 

contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs).    

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

a.       Chief Accountant to record the semi-expendable properties below the 
capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 as semi-expendable property, and to 

provide a separate Supply Ledger Cards for the semi-expendable properties 

for proper monitoring and reconciliation with the Property and Supply Unit 

(PSU); and 

 

b. Property/Supply Officer to properly report/re-classify the semi-expendable 
properties to the Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) from the 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), 

and issue Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) for their issuance. 

 

3. Various Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with a total cost of 
₱732,965.00 that were fully depreciated and had been idle, obsolete, and 

unserviceable were not reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), thus not yet dropped from the books of accounts, 

contrary to Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, affecting the 

fairness of presentation of PPE in the financial statements. 

 

We reiterated our previous recommendation and Management agreed to 

facilitate the immediate disposal of idle, obsolete and unserviceable PPE. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property 

Officer to prepare the IIRUP and submit to the Accountant as basis for the 



 v 

preparation of Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the impairment loss of the 

unserviceable PPE. 

 

4. Travelling expenses for local and foreign amounting to ₱41,836.28 and 
₱288,445.39, respectively were not supported with complete documentary 

requirements as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 14(e) of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 77; hence, the propriety of the expenses could not be 

verified. Moreover, liquidation of CAs granted for travels were delayed by 16 days 

and 74 days, contrary to Section 22(a) of EO No. 77. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth, require the Chief 

Accountant to ensure that the grant and liquidation of CAs for local and foreign 

travel are duly supported with complete documentary requirements, and that 

liquidations are within the reglementary period as prescribed. 

5. The Application and Registration Module and Collection (ARMC) System acquired 
by the OMB in 2018 remained unutilized as at December 31, 2020  due to 

Management’s inaction to resolve the issue on the discovered system bugs/errors 

during the implementation of the system, which prevented the proper flow of 

transactions; hence, consequently delayed the delivery of basic services via 

electronic/online transactions, particularly in the e-registration and applications, e-

permit and automated collections. 

 

We reiterated the recommendation and Management agreed to undertake a 

follow up discussion with the Service Provider relative to the bugs/error discovered 

and request that it be addressed accordingly with minimal cost to the agency, or 

request its enhancement, in order that the System be utilized as intended. 

 

6. Delays ranging from 5 to 350 days were incurred by Management in the submission 
of the required accounting and financial reports covering the period from January to 

December 2020, contrary to prescribed rules and regulations, affecting the timely 

verification and evaluation of reports and transactions, early detection of 

deficiencies and immediate communication thereof to Management.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant 

as well as the PSU Head to submit the required accounting and financial reports 

immediately as these were already due, and henceforth, ensure that all financial 

reports are submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period. 

 

7. GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report (AR) were not 
submitted to Philippine Commission for Women (PCW) for review and 

endorsement to Department of Budget and Management (DBM), in non-compliance 

with Item 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. Moreover, for CY 

2020, OMB allocated ₱3,460,000.00 or five percent of the agency’s 

budget/appropriations as required under Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) 

of RA 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020.  

However, only ₱664,852.07 was utilized in the conduct of GAD related activities of 



 vi 

the allocated fund of ₱3,460,000.00 that resulted in the 0.97 percent implementation 

of the targeted undertakings under GPB. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Person 

to: 

 

a) submit the agency’s GPB and AR to PCW for review and endorsement to 
DBM in accordance with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01; 

 

b) ensure that GAD-related PPAs are properly implemented as planned to attain 
the GAD objectives; and 

 

c) instruct the GFPS to maximize the utilization of the GAD funds through the 
implementation of GAD-related PPAs. 

 

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the eight audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), four were implemented and four were not implemented. The details 

are presented in Part III of this report.
