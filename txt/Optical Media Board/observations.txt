OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 

 

Liquidation of Cash Advances (CAs) not adequately supported  

 

1. Deficiencies were noted in the liquidation of CAs such as: a) liquidation 
report (LR) of ₱121,950.00 was not adequately supported with pertinent 

documents, to establish the validity of the expenses incurred and submitted 

after 20 calendar days after the end of the year;  c) expenses incurred in prior 

year amounting to ₱1,150,007.87 were recognized as expenses in current year; 

and d) deposits of collections from refunds of CAs amounting to ₱659,792.40 

were erroneously recorded as account - Subsidy from National Government 

instead of  Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular Account. 

 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that, Claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation.  Likewise, COA Circular 2012-

001 dated June 14, 2012, prescribing the Revised Guidelines and Documentary 

Requirements for Common Government Transactions, provides that among the 

general requirements for all types of disbursement is the sufficiency and relevance 

of documents to establish validity of claim.  

 

Further, Item 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 states that, the Accountable 

Officer shall liquidate CAs for Field Operating Expenses within 20 calendar days 

after the end of the year. 

 

The OMB shall, as provided under Section 1, Rule 6, Title II of the Rules and 

Regulations Implementing RA No. 9239, or the “Optical Media Act of 2003,” on 

the strength of Inspection Orders duly signed by the Chairman or his duly 

authorized representative, conduct inspection of commercial or business 

establishments or entities including those within the economic zones, engaged in, 

among others, the importation, exportation, or acquisition of optical media; 

importation, exportation, acquisition, sale or use of manufacturing materials for the 

mastering, manufacture or replication of optical media; etc.  

 

To carry out agency mandate, concerned SDOs were granted CAs intended 

for OMB operations and other activities. However, deficiencies were noted in the 

liquidation of CAs as follows:  
 

a) Out of ₱800,000.00 liquidations reported in the LR of the Enforcement 
and Investigation Division (EID), a total of ₱121,950.00 was not supported 

with pertinent documents such as the copy of any government issued 

identification cards and accomplishment reports to support the payments 

of for the services of porters hired during operations.  
 



26 

 

During EID operations, OMB hired porters to assist its agents for the proper 

implementation of these operations. 

 

The LR No. 2020-03-0008 dated March 2, 2020 on the CA of ₱800,000.00 

included the payments for the services of porters totaling ₱121,950.00 charged to 

Representation Expenses. 

 

Post audit of the payments to porter services showed that the only supporting 

document is the acknowledgment receipt in a payroll format which included 

columns for the name of the porter, address, wage rate/pax and signature and at the 

bottom is a certification from the Team Leader of the operation that the porters 

were hired for a particular operation.  

 

   In order for the Audit Team to validate the identity of the hired porters 

whether they are really the ones who received their wage or not, they required a 

copy of any government issued identification cards be included as supporting 

documents for the payment of the wages of the porters and also their 

accomplishment reports.  

 

   Among the recommendation of CY 2019 AAR was the AO to submit the 

copies of any government identification cards and accomplishment reports of the 

porters hired for operations conducted in CY 2019. 

 

Management explained that as much as they would like to submit 

government IDs of the porters, it would be difficult as the porters were randomly 

selected at the place of operations. 

 

The validity for the payments of the porter’s fee could not be established due 

to the absence of the said documents. 

 

b) The CA of ₱800,000.00 was not liquidated within 20 calendar days after 
the end of the year hence, not in conformity with Item 1.2 of COA 

Circular 2012-001. 

 

Scrutiny of the LR revealed that the CAs intended for EID operations for 

September and October, 2019 were also used to pay for the expenses incurred in 

January 2020 amounting to ₱127,171.00.  Details as shown below:

recognized as expenses in CY 2020

Review of the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) for the liquidations of CA 

granted in CY2019 showed that prior year expenses were recorded as current year 

expenses as presented in the table below:

The above expenses, which were recorded as current transactions instead of a 

debit to Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) account, overstated the expenses of the 

current year; thus, were not fairly presented in the CY 2020 Financial Statements. 

 

d) Error in recording deposits of collections of refunds from CAs 
understated the Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account by 

₱659,792.40. 

 

The deposits of collections of refunds from CAs totaling ₱659,792.40 was 

erroneously debited to the account - Subsidy from National Government instead of 

the account - Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular, understating the latter; thus, 

affected the fair presentation of the account in the Financial Statements. 

 

The Revised Chart of Accounts, Volume III of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides that Cash – 

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account is used to recognize in the agency 

books the amount of collections remitted to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) under 

the General Fund, either directly or thru the Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) and 



28 

 

Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDBs); hence, it should be used by 

the agency to record deposits of collections from refunds of cash advances. 

 

The erroneous recording of the deposits overstated the Subsidy from National 

Government account and understated the Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Regular account, affecting the fair presentation of the Financial Statements. 

 

We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed 

to:  

 

a) direct the concerned SDO to submit copies of the identification cards 
and accomplishment reports of the porters hired for operations 

conducted in CY 2019 

 

 submit the copies of the government identification cards and 
accomplishment reports of the porters hired for operations 

conducted in CY 2019; and 

 

b) henceforth, require the Administrative and Finance Division to continue 
to monitor the liquidation of cash advances. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) require the Chief Accountant to: 
 

 record the deposits of collections of refunds from CAs to the account 
Cash Treasury Deposit – Regular; 

 record expenses of prior year to Accumulated Surplus account; and 
 

b) direct the concerned SDO to utilize CAs solely for the specific purpose 
for which they were granted. 

 

Management explained that SDOs cannot submit government issued IDs of 

the porters as those are ordinary people thus, no gov’t issued IDs. Nonetheless, the 

Team recommended during the exit conference that the SDOs to submit pictures 

and accomplishment reports of these porters on operations conducted to support 

the payments/expenses paid of the porters’ services. 

 

 

Non-recognition of Semi-Expendable Properties 

 

2. Management’s practice of non-recognition of properties with capitalization 
below ₱15,000.00 to semi-expendable properties upon receipt of deliveries and 

recording the same as outright Supplies Expense/Supplies and Materials 

Expense were contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs.    



29 

 

Section 10, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: 

 

Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below the capitalization 

threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable 

property. The following policies apply as follows: 

 

a. Semi-expendable properties which were recognized as PPE shall 
be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon 
issuance to the end-user. 

 

Section 17(i) of the same Chapter also provides that Report on the Physical 

Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) shall be used to report the physical 

count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of 

inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include 

the semi-expendable property wherein the issuance is covered by Inventory 

Custodian Slip (ICS). 

 

Examination of the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) revealed that purchases of 

various semi-expendable properties were recorded as outright Office Supplies 

Expenses and Other Supplies and Materials Expenses without recognizing first 

Semi-expendable property with the following details:

The Chief Accountant confirmed that purchases of the above-listed semi-

expendable properties were charged outright to expenses.  

 

Further verification of the submitted report on semi-expendable properties by 

the Property and Supply Unit (PSU) to the Audit Team disclosed that semi-

expendable properties are included in the Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) instead of the RPCI, contrary to Section 

17(i) of Chapter 8, and rendering the RPCPPE incorrect. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

a) Chief Accountant to record the semi-expendable properties below the 
capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 as semi-expendable property, and 

to provide a separate Supply Ledger Cards for the semi-expendable 

properties for proper monitoring and reconciliation with the PSU; and 

 

b) Property/Supply Officer to properly report/re-classify the semi-
expendable properties to the RPCI from the RPCPPE, and issue ICS for 

their issuance.

Non-disposal of various unserviceable properties 

 

3. Various Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with a total cost of 
₱732,965.00 that were fully depreciated and had been idle, obsolete, and 

unserviceable were not reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), thus not yet dropped from the books of 

accounts, contrary to Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs, affecting the fairness of presentation of PPE in the financial 

statements. 
 

Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states: 

 

c) PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of 
providing the entity with future economic benefits or service 

potential.  

 

d) All unserviceable property shall be reported in the IIRUP 
(Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from 

the books by debiting Impairment Loss – Property, Plant and 

Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

In addition, Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that when government 

property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, 

upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of 

the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 

concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their 

presence. 

 

Review of the submitted RPCPPE prepared by PSU as at December 31, 2020 

showed a total cost of ₱89,018,524.65, which tallied per books of the Accounting 

Unit. However, it was noted that the RPCPPE included various idle, obsolete and 

unserviceable PPE totaling ₱732,965.00, with the following details:

Among the recommendations contained in CY 2019 AAR was for 

management to conduct periodic inspection and assessment of PPE and facilitate 

the immediate disposal of idle, obsolete and unserviceable PPE. Accordingly, all 

the unserviceable PPEs identified in the CY 2019 AAR were disposed by the 

agency except for the Communication Equipment, which were reiterated in the 

above Table, in addition to newly identified unserviceable PPE in CY 2020. 

 

Moreover, no IIRUP as of December 31, 2020 was submitted by the PSU to 

the Accounting Unit; hence, no impairment loss was recorded to drop the said PPE 

from the books as prescribed under Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the 

GAM for NGAs. 

 

The Manual on Disposal of Government Property embodied under NBC No. 

425 dated January 28, 1992 was issued to guide agencies in their disposal 

undertakings. It further provides that it would be beneficial for agencies to 

immediately dispose unserviceable PPE to avoid further deterioration. A 

systematic and timely disposal will yield benefits in terms of a higher appraised 

value and enabling storage areas available for other purposes. 

 

We reiterated our previous recommendation and Management agreed to 

facilitate the immediate disposal of idle, obsolete and unserviceable PPE. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to instruct the 

Property Officer to prepare the IIRUP and submit to the Accountant as basis 

for the preparation of JEV to record the impairment loss of the unserviceable 

PPE. 

 

 

Incomplete documentation of Local and Foreign Travels  

 

4. Travelling expenses for local and foreign amounting to ₱41,836.28 and 
₱288,445.39, respectively were not supported with complete documentary 

requirements as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 

14(e) of EO No. 77; hence, the propriety of the expenses could not be verified. 

Moreover, liquidation of CAs granted for travels were delayed by 16 days and 

74 days, contrary to Section 22(a) of EO No. 77. 

 

The documentary requirements on the grant of traveling allowance are 

enumerated in Items 1.1.4.1 and 1.1.4.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 

14, 2012, while the documentary requirements for its liquidation are enumerated in 

Items 1.2.4.1 and 1.2.4.2.

For the reimbursement of actual travel expenses in excess of prescribed rate, 

Section 14(e) of EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2019 provides that reimbursement of 

actual accommodation expenses in excess of the accommodation component of the 

Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) may be allowed, subject to approval of the 

Office of the President (OP) for Heads of NGAs under or attached to the OP, but in 

no case shall the difference exceed 30 percent of such component of the prescribed 

DSA rate, and only upon certification of the head of agency as absolute necessary 

in the performance of an assignment and presentation of bills and receipt. 

 

As shown in the above Table, in addition to the lack of OR, the approval of 

the OP was not attached to the LR to support the claim of reimbursement of actual 

travel expenses in excess of prescribed rate. 

 

It was also noted that delays of 16 days and 74 days were incurred by the 

official and employees in the liquidation of their cash advances for local and 

foreign travels, with the following details:

Section 22(a) of EO No. 77 further provides that within two calendar months 

after the return of an official or employee to the Philippines, in the case of official 

travel abroad, or within one month of his/her return to permanent official station in 

the case of official local travel, such official or employee shall render an account 

of the cash advance received in accordance with existing applicable rules and 

regulations. 

 

The Chief Accountant explained that delay in the liquidation of CAs for local 

and foreign travels was due to the accountable person’s late submission or failure 

to submit complete documents within the prescribed period upon return to 

permanent official station. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth, require the 

Chief Accountant to ensure that the grant and liquidation of CAs for local 

and foreign travel are duly supported with complete documentary 

requirements, and that liquidations are within the reglementary period as 

prescribed. 

 

Management had complied and submitted the supporting documents 

pertaining to the local travel as recommended by the audit team. Meanwhile, the 

recommendation pertaining to foreign travel remained outstanding since the 

required supporting documents remained unsubmitted by the Management. 

 

 

Non-utilization of the ARMCS of the agency 

 

5. The Application and Registration Module and Collection (ARMC) System 
acquired by the OMB in 2018 remained unutilized as at December 31, 2020  

due to Management’s inaction to resolve the issue on the discovered system 

bugs/errors during the implementation of the system, which prevented the 

proper flow of transactions; hence, consequently delayed the delivery of basic 

services via electronic/online transactions, particularly in the e-registration 

and applications, e-permit and automated collections. 

 

Pursuant to RA No. 9239, the OMB has the power to regulate, grant, or 

renew licenses for specific periods, or deny, suspend, or cancel the same, subject to 

such conditions as it may impose, for the activities enumerated in Section 13 of the 

same Act to wit: 

 



35 

 

a) Importation, exportation, acquisition, sale or distribution of optical 
media, manufacturing equipment, parts and accessories and 

manufacturing materials used or intended for use in the mastering, 

manufacture or replication of optical media; 

b) Possession or operation of manufacturing equipment, parts and 
accessories, or the possession, acquisition, sale or use of manufacturing 

materials for the mastering, manufacture or replication of optical media; 

and 

 

c) The mastering, manufacture, replication, importation or exportation of 
optical media. 

 

The OMB entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in 2018 with the 

10-17 Consulit Technologies & Services Inc., as the Service Provider, for the 

development of ARMCS with a total cost of ₱178,750.00.  The said software aims 

to deliver the basic services of OMB to the public, via electronic/online 

transactions such as e-registration and applications, e-permit and automated 

collections.  

 

The said System was noted by the previous audit team during CY 2019 to be 

successfully installed, the assigned personnel were trained on its basic navigations, 

and the OMB had already issued Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) on 

August 6, 2018, which was the basis of OMB in paying the Service Provider 

through Check No. 02344827 dated September 26, 2018 for the cost of the 

contract. 

 

In CY 2019, it was observed that the System remained unutilized due to the  

Management’s inaction to resolve the issue on the discovered system bugs/errors 

during its implementation, which prevented the proper flow of the transactions.  

 

Thus, it was recommended in the CY2019 AAR and Management agreed to 

discuss with the Service Provider the bugs/error discovered and request that it be 

addressed accordingly with minimal cost to the agency, or request its 

enhancement, in order that the System be utilized as intended. 

 

On September 02, 2020, OMB and the Service Provider executed another 

MOA costing ₱120,000.00, where the agency requested the Service Provider to: a) 

enhance the features of the existing system in response to COVID-19 pandemic; 

and b) publish its application and registration system in the cloud to ensure its 

online availability and security against physical damage due to hardware failure 

and tampering. 

 

Per MOA, the new obligations of the Service Provider are the following:  

 

 within a period of one month from the signing of the Agreements and 
forwarding of the OMB of the complete requirements, enhance the 



36 

 

existing registration, licensing and collection system of OMB and 

publish to cloud so OMB clients could access it via internet; 

 

 reflect the following changes to the system: 
o Client generated permit with QR Code for authentication. 
o Incorporate improvements in processing of requests identified 

within one month from the signing of the agreement. 

o Add feature to allow importation of LinkBiz payment data from 
Statement of Account Receivable from Landbank 

 

 integrate the system to LinkBiz payment gateway within one month 
from the signing of the agreement, if possible; 

 

 upload clients data submitted by OMB to the system database within 
one month from the signing of agreement; 

 

 participate in the review of the system for further enhancements; 
 

 conduct users re-training to OMB personnel and assist OMB on the 
clients training; and 

 

 revise the existing system manual. 
 

On the other hand, the MOA also provides the following obligations of OMB 

among others: 

 

 provides the Service Provider with information necessary for the 
enhancement of OMB web-based registration and collection system; 

 

 undertakes to make its personnel available during the enhancement 
user-requirement definition, presentation, testing and implementation of 

any system developed to achieve the objectives of the agreement;  

 

 provide the Service Provider with access and authority and any of its 
electronic equipment and/or gadgets as well as facilities needed to 

develop any application provided in the agreement, without additional 

cost/expense to Service Provider; 

 

 may request that reasonable changes (will not take one day to develop) 
be made to the specification and tasks associated with its 

implementation. If the client requests such a change, the Service 

Provider will use its best efforts to implement the requested change at 

no additional expense to the OMB and without delivery of the 

Software. In the event that the proposed change will, in the sole 

discretion of the Service Provider, require a delay in the delivery of the 

software or would result in additional expense to OMB, then the OMB 



37 

 

and the Service Provider shall confer and the OMB may either 

withdraw the proposed change or require the Service Provider to 

deliver the software with the proposed change and subject to delay 

and/or additional expense. The OMB agrees and acknowledges that the 

judgment as to if there will be any delay or additional expense shall be 

made solely by the Service Provider. 

 

However, we observed the same deficiency in our audit of CY 2020.  As at 

December 31, 2020, the system remained unutilized due to the unresolved system 

bugs/error, which prevented the proper flow of the transactions. Despite this, it was 

noted that OMB had paid the Service Provider the 50 percent down payment of 

₱60,000.00, under Check No. 2351951 dated August 26, 2020, upon signing of the 

new MOA. Moreover, the outstanding balance at the end of the year signified the 

Service Provider’s non-completion of the task within the timeframe stated in the 

agreement. 

 

Inquiry with the Management disclosed that actual testing was done with the 

assistance of the Service Provider, however, system bugs and errors were still 

discovered. As of March 2021, no further action was undertaken by the 

Management to resolve the problem. Nevertheless, the other terms and conditions 

of the MOA still remain in force and in effect until the accomplishment of the 

purpose provided therein; hence, problems/issues discovered could still be fixed by 

the Service Provider unless Management choose to terminate the MOA. 

 

The non-action of Management to resolve the discovered problem delayed 

the utilization of the ARMCS and consequently delayed the delivery of basic 

services   resulting in the wastage of government resources. 

 

We reiterated the recommendation and Management agreed to 

undertake a follow up discussion with the Service Provider relative to the 

bugs/error discovered and request that it be addressed accordingly with 

minimal cost to the agency, or request its enhancement, in order that the 

System be utilized as intended. 

 

Management informed that the system is made available to the public last 

April 6, 2021. The new and improved system can now generate e-permits and e-

licenses online with QR code for authentication. It also incorporated Linkbiz portal 

for online payments to limit face-to-face interactions with the clients. 

 

 

Delayed Submission of Accounting and Financial Reports 

 

6. Delays ranging from 5 to 350 days were incurred by Management in the 
submission of the required accounting and financial reports covering the 

period from January to December 2020, contrary to prescribed rules and 

regulations, affecting the timely verification and evaluation of reports and 



38 

 

transactions, early detection of deficiencies and immediate communication 

thereof to Management.  

 

Paragraph 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides

We had monitored and reviewed the submission of CY 2020 accounting and

The Chief Accountant admitted that the incurred delays in the submission of 

CY 2020 accounting and financial reports were due to the COVID-19 pandemic 

and the implementation of the new work arrangement of OMB officials and 

employees under various community quarantines. 

 

The implementation of Enhance Community Quarantine (ECQ) and 

Modified Enhance Community Quarantine (MECQ) in response to the COVID-19 

pandemic were already taken into consideration by the Audit Team, however, 

continuous delays in the submission of the said reports were still incurred by 

OMB, precluding the timely verification and examination of reports and 

transactions, early detection of deficiencies and immediate communication thereof 

to Management.  

 

Further, unjustified failure on the part of the official or employee concerned 

to submit the accounting and financial reports/documents mentioned herein shall 

be a ground for the automatic suspension of payment of his/her salary until he/she 

shall have complied with the aforesaid requirements, as imposed under Section 

122 (2) of  PD No. 1445. 

 



40 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief 

Accountant as well as the PSU Head to submit the required accounting and 

financial reports immediately as these were already due, and henceforth, 

ensure that all financial reports are submitted to the Audit Team within the 

prescribed period. 

 

 

B.  Other Areas 

 

COVID-19 Expenses 

7.  No COVID-19 Fund was received by the agency however, they had incurred 
COVID-19 related expenses such as payments of hazard pay and purchases of 

alcohols, facemasks and Vitamins for CY 2020 amounting to ₱151,803.50 that 

were charged to the regular fund of OMB. 

 

 

Dormant Accounts 

 

8. The Receivables-Disallowances amounting to ₱1,609,132.91 remained dormant in 
the agency’s book for 34 years.  

 

The Receivables-Disallowances and Charges are the salaries and allowances 

of Former Board of Directors of then Videogram Regulatory Board (VRB) (now 

OMB), which were found to have no valid and approved appointments from the 

Office of the President in the Special Audit conducted by the Commission on 

Audit in 1986 and 1987.  Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2013-095 issued on 

July 7, 2013 relative to this, however, it remained unsettled as of year-end for the 

reason that the Management could not enforce the settlement of the same since 

they could no longer locate the persons liable. 

 

 

Non-utilization of five percent budget allocated to GAD program and activities 

 

9. GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report (AR) were not 
submitted to Philippine Commission for Women (PCW) for review and 

endorsement to Department of Budget and Management (DBM), in non-

compliance with Item 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

Moreover, for CY 2020, OMB allocated ₱3,460,000.00 or five percent of the 

agency’s budget/appropriations as required under Section 31 of the General 

Provisions (GP) of RA 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 

Fiscal Year 2020.  However, only ₱664,852.07 was utilized in the conduct of 

GAD related activities of the allocated fund of ₱3,460,000.00 that resulted in 

the 0.97 percent implementation of the targeted undertakings under GPB. 

 

Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465 provides that: 



41 

 

 

“The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For 

this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 

relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of 

gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance 

with said requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated 

based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies” 

 

Further, Item 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides 

that the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) shall submit the final GPB and the 

corresponding AR to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM. 

  

The OMB GPB and AR duly approved and signed by the Head of the 

Agency was submitted to the audit team. However, the GAD Focal Chair disclosed 

that the said reports were not actually submitted to PCW for review and 

endorsement to DBM. 

 

Moreover, review of the submitted GPB and AR revealed that the agency 

was unable to utilize the five percent of the total agency budget/appropriation of 

₱68,307,000.00 or ₱3,460,000.00 allocated for GAD Projects, Programs and 

Activities (PPAs). It only utilized ₱664,852.07 or 0.97 percent of the 

₱3,460,000.00. 

 

It was explained that the non-submission of GPB and AR to the PCW was 

due to the system-problem encountered in their online submission to the PCW 

website, as well as due to the COVID-19 pandemic where regular office work was 

disrupted. Likewise, the non-attainment of the full implementation of GAD-related 

PPAs, and the minimal utilization of GAD budget was due to the effect of the 

COVID-19 pandemic in the normal operations of the agency, and the limitations 

imposed by various health protocols in response to the pandemic. 

 

The Audit Team took into consideration the adverse effect of the current 

COVID-19 pandemic in the operation of the agency and in the implementation of 

GAD-related PPAs. Nevertheless, Management’s failure to submit GPB and AR to 

PCW had prevented the latter to review and endorse the same to DBM. 

Meanwhile, the non-implementation of GAD-related PPAs had deprived the 

possible benefactors of the opportunities that could have been derived therefrom.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal 

Person to: 

 



42 

 

a) submit the agency’s GPB and AR to PCW for review and endorsement 
to DBM in accordance with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-

01; 

 

b) ensure that GAD-related PPAs are properly implemented as planned to 
attain the GAD objectives; and 

 

c) instruct the GFPS to maximize the utilization of the GAD funds through 
the implementation of GAD-related PPAs. 

 

NTF-ELCAC Fund 

10.  OMB did not receive NTF-ELCAC Fund from Department of Budget and     
Management (DBM) and was not included in the list of DBM NTF-ELCAC Fund

11. For CY 2020, OMB aimed to continuously support and motivate Senior Citizens to 
render their services in the government and continued to deputize them to help 

monitor compliance of the public with RA No. 9239. Likewise, the OMB 

continued to provide a special lane for Persons with Disability and Senior Citizens 

in the front-line area of its Office.

12. The OMB prepared a Disaster Risk Reduction Plan in compliance with Section 36 
of the GP of 2020 GAA. The objective of the said plan is to establish awareness 

and prepare the OMB employees for disasters. OMB has prepared specific steps to

Accounting Unit.

2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS as 

required under RA No. 656, known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as amended 

by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.

officials in CYs 1986 and 1987 with Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2013-095 

issued on July 7, 2013. This remained unsettled as of year-end. Management could 

not enforce the settlement of the same since they could no longer locate the 

persons liable.
