EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 
A. Introduction 

 
1. The Surigao State College of Technology (SSCT) is a public state college which 

was created by virtue of Republic Act No. 8650. The Act which was approved on 
June 5, 1998 converting the Surigao del Norte School of Arts and Trades and the 
Malimono School of Fisheries into a state college.  Effective October 30, 2000, 
the Siargao National College of Science and Technology, Del Carmen, Surigao 
del Norte was integrated to SSCT pursuant to the Special Provisions of the 
General Appropriations Act for CYs 1999 and 2000. 
 

2. The SSCT is composed of the Main Campus in Surigao City, three (3) satellite 
campuses namely:  the Malimono Campus in Malimono, Surigao del Norte, the 
Del Carmen Campus situated in Del Carmen, Surigao del Norte, the Mainit 
Campus in Mainit, Surigao del Norte, and one (1) extension campus, the Claver 
Extension Campus in Municipality of Claver, Surigao del Norte. 

 
3. The audit was conducted in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory   

requirements, and the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions 
(ISSAIs).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable basis for our conclusions. 

 
4. The audit covered the accounts and operations of the SSCT for CY 2020 and was 

aimed at ascertaining the propriety of financial transactions, Management’s 
compliance with prescribed rules and regulations, and the fairness in the 
presentation of financial statements. Performance/Value for Money audit was also 
conducted on programs/activities/projects and operations to determine whether 
the objectives of the projects were attained, and efficiency, effectiveness and 
economy were observed in the performance of duties and functions.

C. Audit Opinion 

 

7. The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 
financial statements of the Surigao State College of Technology for CY 2020 in 
view of the following:      

 
a) The accuracy and correctness of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current 

Accounts (LCCA) balance of P384,398,755.77 as of year-end was doubtful 
due to: (a) Unadjusted and/or unsubstantiated reconciling items amounting to 
P55,452,479.77; (b) Non-submission of the original copies of Credit 
Memoranda (CM)/Debit Memoranda (DM); and (c) Un-updated Cashbook 
maintained by the Cashier.  
 

b) The year-end balance of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges account 
amounting to P1,898,901.08 was misstated due to: (a) Failure by the 
Accounting Office to set-up receivables from audit disallowances/charges 
which had become final and executory with subject amount of 
P22,608,785.70; (b) Misclassification of restitutions from audit disallowances 
which were credited to Other Payables account instead of the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges totaling P19,693,709.15;  (c) Unrecorded refunds from 
disallowances of Hazard Pay and Extra Bonus amounting to P706,208.16 and 
P83,316.01, respectively, or a total of P789,524.17; and (d) The CY 2003 



   
 

beginning balance of the account amounting to P492,924.34, as well as the 
transfer or debit of P12,683.02 in CY 2005 were deficient of schedules and/or 
supporting documents, casting doubt on the accuracy, completeness and 
valuation thereof. 
 

c) The accuracy, existence, and completeness of the Inventory account with a 
year-end balance of P47,710,456.89 was doubtful due to: (a) Unreconciled 
Inventory balance between the Supply and Accounting Offices amounting to 
P38,275,485.51; and (b) Un-updated Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the 
Accounting Office.   

 
d) The accuracy, existence, and completeness of the Property, Plant and 

Equipment (PPE) account with a year-end net value balance of 
P618,342,103.74 was doubtful due to: (a) Unreconciled PPE balance between 
the Supply and Accounting offices of P34,421,991.38; (b) Properties were not 
supported with Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) amounting to 
P49,294,416.27; (c) Items found during physical count were not included in 
the Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (d) 
Items in the RPCPPE were not found during physical count with subject 
amount of P2,467,434.00; (e) Demolished properties were not dropped from 
the books or added to  the appropriate PPE account totaling P3,183,720.91; (f) 
Unrecognized donated properties; (g) Transferred PPEs from an Accountable 
Officer (AO) to another were not covered with Property Transfer Report 
(PTR) and PAR; and (h) Absence of list/report of the buildings and estates 
prepared and maintained by the BEO. 

 
e) The reported year-end balance of the Construction in Progress (CIP) – 

Buildings and Other Structures account of P150,533,478.76 was misstated by 
P35,927,904.44 which corresponds to: (a) A completed Improvement & 
Repair of Poultry Building which was still included in the account and was not 
reclassified to the appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account 
amounting to P856,909.62; (b) Capitalizable betterments/enhancements costs 
incurred during the construction of SSCT’s infrastructures which were not 
directly recorded under the appropriate PPE account totaling P20,590,928.52; 
and (c) Two (2) On-going development projects which were misclassified 
under the CIP- Buildings and Other Structures account instead of the 
appropriate CIP account totaling P14,480,066.30.  Moreover, the Accounting 
Office did not prepare and maintain CIP-Ledger Cards in which the balance of 
the CIP – Buildings and Other Structures account did not reconcile with the 
records being kept by the BEO for the purpose showing a variance of 
P24,986,872.06, thus casting doubt on the accuracy, completeness and 
valuation thereof. 

 
f) Trust receipts under the Trust Fund of the College amounting to 

P105,111,177.33 were credited and misclassified to Other Payables Account 
instead of the following appropriate Payable accounts: (a) Due to NGAs – 



   
 

P61,890,280.15; (b) Due to LGU – P4,457,779.72; (c) Trust Liabilities – 
P38,436,476.07; and (d) Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable - P326,641.39 
resulting in overstatements/ understatements of the affected accounts, thus 
misstating the financial statements. 

 
g) The refund of disallowances/charges in audit and receipts of liquidated 

damages totaling P20,308,772.36 were misclassified to Other Payables 
Account instead of a credit to: (a) Receivable – Disallowances/Charges 
totaling P19,693,709.15; and (b) Income/Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in the 
amount of P615,063.21 resulting in overstatements/understatements of the 
affected accounts, thereby misstating the financial statements. 

 
h) The reported balance of Intangible Assets amounting to P11,499,224.18 was 

misstated due to failure of the Management to amortize the same in the books. 
Moreover, the prescribed disclosures of the Assets were not presented in the 
Notes to Financial Statements for the period covered, precluding the users of 
the FS to obtain other relevant information thereof. 

 
8. For the above-mentioned audit observations, which have caused the issuance of a 

qualified opinion, we recommended the following: 
 

a) The Management shall: (1) Request in writing the LBP to furnish the former 
original copies of the CM/DM involving financial transactions of the 
depository accounts maintained at the latter; (2) Advise the Accountant to 
immediately record in the books all the reconciling items sourcing information 
from the availed CM/DM from the bank and other available documents; and 
(3) Require the Cashier to update her Cashbooks regularly as required by law. 

b) The Management shall: (1) Direct the Accountant to make adjusting entries in 
the books to: (a) Recognize receivables from audit disallowances/charges 
which had become final and executory with subject amount of 
P22,608,785.70; (b) Reclassify the restitutions from audit disallowances 
totaling P19,693,709.15 which were credited to Other Payables account 
instead of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges.  Installment payments of 
refunds should not be deposited in the Trust Fund and credited to Other 
Payables account, rather, the same shall be credited to the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges account and deposited directly to the Fund where 
these correspondingly charged/drawn; and (c) Record the refunds from 
disallowances of Hazard Pay and Extra Bonus amounting to P706,208.16 and 
P83,316.01, respectively, or a total of P789,524.17; and (2) Advise the 
Accountant to exert more effort in gathering documents to provide schedule or 
substantiate the CY 2003 beginning balance of the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges account amounting to P492,924.34, as well as the 
transfer or debit of P12,683.02 in CY 2005.  

c) The Management require: (1) The Accounting and Supply offices to reconcile 



   
 

their Inventory records as mandated in Chapter 5 of the Property and Supply 
Management Handbook; (2) The Inventory Team to conduct physical count of 
all the School’s inventory at least semi-annually, June 30 and December 31 of

the Audit Team; (3) The Accountant to update the SLCs as required in Section 
17, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs; (4) The Supply Officer to finish, as soon 
as possible, the updating of the ICSs covering the issued semi-expendable

end users; (5) The Supply Officer to prepare and maintain a list showing all 
and complete, with specific and readily-verifiable information, issued semi-

No. 1445 and Section 11, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and lastly, 
(6) The Supply Officer to prepare and issue ICS, instead of PAR, for all issued 
semi-expendable items. 

d) The Management shall: (1) Instruct the Accounting and Supply offices to 
reconcile their PPE records in compliance with Section 42 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I; (2) Advise the Supply to update the PARs covering the issued PPEs 
and to do so every time properties are acquired and being used by any school 
personnel; (3) Direct the Supply Office to revisit and verify their records vis-
à-vis the existing properties and the documents prepared as the result of the 
physical count conducted like the ones from COA.  Update the list for any 
unrecorded PPEs and reconcile the same with the accounting records.  
Recheck the record for missing/lost PPEs.  Ensure that the respective 
accountable officer shall be held answerable for the unaccounted properties; 
(4) Inform the Supply Office to prepare the Report of Loss, Stolen, Damaged 
or Destroyed Property to account the demolished PPEs, as well as the list of 
donated properties and the supporting documents thereof to the Accounting 
Office for recognition/derecognition of the same in the books.  The Supply 
Office shall also prepare the PTR for any movement of property from one AO 
to another and to update the corresponding PAR covering the item; (5) Instruct 
the BEO to prepare and maintain a list of the School’s acquired and completed 
estates, buildings and other structures for monitoring and reconciliation 
purposes; and lastly, (6) Request the VP for Administration to review and 
monitor the policies administered in the utilization and disposition of school 
properties as required in the College Code. 

e) The Management shall: (1) Direct the BEO to promptly furnish the 
Accounting Office of all the records and information regarding the School’s 
completed constructed projects so that the latter will have basis, on a timely 
manner, the recording thereof in the books; (2) Instruct the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reclassify the completed 
infrastructure projects to their respective appropriate PPE account, as well as 
those capitalizable subsequent costs directly to the carrying amount of the 
specific PPE; (3) Advise the Accountant to reclassify the projects Construction 
of Perimeter Fence and Improvement of Water Facilities under the CIP-



   
 

Buildings and Other Structures account to CIP-Land Improvements and CIP-

Buildings and Estate Office to reconcile their records as required by law and 
the former to prepare and maintain ledgers for the CIP accounts. 

f) The Management shall advise the Accountant to make adjusting entries in the 
books to reclassify the Other Payables account of P105,111,177.33 to 
appropriate liability accounts by debiting the Other Payables Account and 
crediting the appropriate liability accounts. 

g) The Management shall instruct the Accountant to make adjusting entries in the 
books to reclassify the Other Payables Account to Receivable – 
Disallowances/Charges and Income/Equity Accounts in the amount of 
P19,693,709.15 and P615,063.21, respectively.  Restitutions from 
disallowances and/or charges shall be deposited and recorded directly to the 
specific fund where the illegal/irregular disbursements were originally made. 

h) The Management shall: (1) Instruct the Accounting, ITSO and ICT Offices to

relevant disclosures thereof in the Notes to FS as prescribed in Section 16, 
Chapter 12 of GAM for NGAs. 

 

D. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 

 
9. The other significant audit observations and recommendations are as follows: 

 
a) Residential building and office structure owned by private individuals were 

constructed within the Surigao State College and Technology (SSCT), 
Malimono Campus premise without legal ownership/authority or agreement 
with the College to construct, operate and/or dwell within the SSCT property 
contrary to Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Article 120 
of the SSCT College Code, depriving the School to enjoy the use of its own 
property and exposing the same to risk of legal disputes in the future, hence, 
interest of the government property was not fully protected. 

 
We recommended that Management shall take appropriate action by sending 
a letter to the concerned illegal settlers to formally inform them of the 
school’s ownership over the estate and to request from the latter documents as 
proof of ownership over the land they are occupying and/or 
agreement/authority from the School to construct, operate and/or dwell 
therein. Moreover, expedite the request for intervention from the OSG 
through a letter asking legal remedies to address the matter. 

 



   
 

b) The quarterly financial statements, monthly trial balance as well as the 
monthly bank reconciliation statements of the College were not submitted to 
the Office of the Auditor in a timely manner as required under Section 122 of 
P.D. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 19 and Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, 
Volume I, precluding the timely conduct of audit on the said accounts and 
errors, if any, could not be detected and corrected immediately. 
 
We recommended that Management shall: (1) Require the Accountant to 
strictly comply with Section 122 of PD No. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 19 and 
Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, in the submission of the 
financial reports to the Commission to facilitate the timely audit of the 
account balances; (2) Adopt a very good, high-technology accounting system. 
An efficient accounting system is a vital aid/partner in achieving the vision of 
the College which is to be an innovative and technology-advanced learning 
institution in the locality. A reliable accounting system will greatly help the 
School in the real-time generation of financial reports specially at the present 
that it gears up for a university hood; and (3) Enroll the College’s depository 
accounts with the LBP’s We-Access Facility feature for the former to have 
real time access to its financial transactions with the bank.  The Management 
may likewise make a representation and request in writing to the bank to 
furnish the College the bank statements or snapshots of the transactions 
involving the latter’s depository accounts to facilitate the timely preparation 
of the BRS. 

 
c) The procurement process of the project Improvement of Electrical Facilities of 

SSCT Mainit Campus with a contract cost of P14,461,327.08 was not properly 
and completely observed, contrary with pertinent sections of the 2016 Revised 
IRR of R.A. No. 9184 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus transparency, 
competitiveness and accountability in the procurement of the project was not 
fully ensured. Likewise, the payment was not supported with complete 
documentation which deviates from Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445, thus 
manifesting weak internal controls in the disbursement process. 

 
We recommended that Management shall require the BAC, including the 
BAC Secretariat and the TWG to immediately submit the lacking documents 
and explain the presence of procurement deficiencies/irregularities.  Likewise, 
ensure that all documents necessary to support the procurement are attached to 
the contract before the same is submitted to the Auditor’s Office for auditorial 
review; and observe strict adherence to the pertinent provisions of the 2016 
Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 to properly and completely observe the 
procurement process. 
 

d) The small value purchases of goods by the College aggregating P1,859,914.29 
had not been done through alternative mode of procurement contrary to 
Sections 10 and 48 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) 
of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184 thus, the assurance that the goods were 



   
 

obtained at the most advantageous price for the government, and the 
competitiveness and transparency in government procurement were not fully 
upheld.   
We recommended that Management shall stop the purchase of small value 
goods without the alternative mode of procurement.  All purchases below the 
threshold set in Annex H of the IRR of R.A. No. 9184 should be procured 
through alternative mode of procurement subject to the corresponding 
requirements provided. 
 

e) Expenses incurred in the conduct of school meetings, trainings, seminars, 
orientations, evaluations, interviews, as well as those purchases of supplies for 
office use, CoViD-19 response, and IGP operations totaling P959,496.55 were 
paid on a reimbursement basis instead of making payments directly to the 
suppliers contrary to Section 10 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations 
(IRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184, Sections 91 and 93 of Presidential 
Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020, and Section 2 of 
COA Circular No. 97-002, thus: (a) the government was deprived from the 
collection of taxes that could have been withheld out of the payments; (b) the 
assurance that the goods were purchased at the most advantageous price for 
the government, and the competitiveness and transparency in government 
procurement were not upheld; and (c) the process may be abused and may 
lead to misappropriation of funds if continuously practiced.  Moreover, 
Sections 12.2 of R.A. No. 9184 was not complied when the Agency allowed 
the end users to serve the Price Quotation Forms (PQFs) to the prospective 
suppliers instead by the BAC personnel. 
 
We recommended that Management shall: (1) Procure all goods through 
public bidding or alternative mode or procurement when conditions allow.  
Refrain from effecting payments on the purchases of goods and services being 
utilized for various school meetings, trainings, seminars, orientations, 
evaluations, interviews, as well as those used in operations and activities 
through reimbursement basis.  Carefully plan and estimate all the expenses to 
be incurred and include any contingencies as warranted; and (2) Advise the 
BAC to conduct all the bidding processes of the School’s procurements.  This 
responsibility rests solely with the BAC as stated in R.A. No. 9184. 

 
f) The College paid CoViD-19 Hazard Pay totaling P269,250.00 to its Contract 

of Services (CoS) or Job Orders (JOs) workers that was charged against the 
Income Generating Project (IGP) Fund not in accordance with Item 5.1 of 
DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1.  Moreover, a total of P374,625.00 
CoViD-19 Hazard Pay was granted to the College personnel, including the 
CoS and JOs, who reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the locality without prior approval or 
authority from the College President contrary to Item 4.3 of the same DBM 
Budget Circular rendering all the payments irregular.   
 



   
 

We recommended that Management shall submit to the Auditor the 
justification or legal basis for the payments of CoViD-19 Hazard Pay that 
were charged against the IGP-MOOE.  Likewise, the Management shall 
submit to COA the complete documents showing the authority from the 
College President of the SSCT personnel, including the CoS and JOs, to report 
for work during the implementation of ECQ in the locality, and which was 
paid by Management. 
 

g) The College did not optimally utilize its CY 2020 GAD Fund amounting to 
P195,956,380.00 as evidenced by: (a) Very low utilization rate of 7.81 percent 
or only P15,311,911.00 out of P195,956,380.00 annual budget; (b) Inclusion 
in the GAD budget and utilization of two (2) programs or activities which did 
not have clear identified gender issues and concerns in the total amount of 
P6,500,000.00; and (c) Attribution in the GAD budget and utilization the 
School’s four (4) major programs or activities without administration or 
conduct of the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) 
assessment with subject amount of P13,268,845.20, contrary to Sections 2 and 
43 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9710 and Items 1.2 and 1.2.3.2 of PCW 
Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02, defeating the purpose for which the 
program was created.   
 
We recommended that Management shall: (1) Advise the GFPS to optimally 
utilize the GAD budget to implement the programs and activities indicated in 
the GPB as mandated in Sections 2 and 43 of R.A. No. 9710; (2) Instruct the 
GFPS to only include in the GPB and its utilization the programs and 
activities that addressed clear and evident gender issues and concerns as 
expressly required in R.A. No. 9710 and Items 1.2 of PCW Memorandum 
Circular No. 2019-02.  The PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 
likewise reiterated the compliance to the requirement; and (3) Advise the 
GFPS to always use the HGDG assessment tool in attributing a portion or the 
whole budget of the agency’s major programs/projects to the GAD budget. 

 
h) Three infrastructure projects totaling P4,804,002.01 remained unfinished 

despite the expiration of contract period, contrary to the Contract and 
Agreement signed by and between the Surigao State College of Technology 
(SSCT) and the Contractor and Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 
1445, thus deprived the intended beneficiaries from immediate usage of the 
facilities and defeated the purpose of the fund where the projects were 
appropriated.  Likewise, the Management failed to impose appropriate actions 
and remedies pursuant to Section III-A (2.c.i) of the Guidelines on 
Termination of Contracts and Section 4.2.g. of the Uniform Guidelines for 
Blacklisting of Manufacturers, Suppliers, Distributors, Contractors and 
Consultant. 
 
We recommended that Management shall: (1) Send a demand letter to the 
Contractor for the immediate completion of the project including the 



   
 

repairs/modification thereto, if needed, without incurring additional cost to 
SSCT; (2) Impose liquidated damages against the Contractors, if warranted, in 
accordance with Section 68 of the Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9184; (3) If justifiable under the 
circumstances, initiate termination of the Contract with the Contractor and 
issue Blacklisting Order against the latter and the forfeiture of their 
corresponding performance security and money retention; and (4) Instruct the 
BEO to reassess and re-compute the cost of each project and to determine 
whether it is more beneficial to award the corresponding contract thereof to 
another contractor. 

 
i) Two (2) infrastructure projects implemented through “By Administration” at a 

total cost of P4,000,000.00 remained partially completed as of year-end, 
despite the expiration of construction period, contrary to Section 2 of 
Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 depriving the intended beneficiaries from 
prompt availment of the full benefits expected therefrom.  Moreover, the 
Management failed to immediately perform corrective measures to utilize the 
available resources pursuant to Section 41.5 of the SSCT College Code so that 
further loss and/or wastage of the same could be avoided. 
 
We recommended that Management shall: (1) Ensure that all infrastructure 
projects are strictly monitored in accordance with plans and schedules of 
implementation, henceforth execute/implement the projects as planned; and 
(2) Immediately perform corrective measures to utilize the available resources 
of unfinished projects to avoid further loss and damage thereof.  Ensure that 
the utilization of the remaining budget and materials for other purpose must 
bear the approval of the Planning Office and the Board of Trustees. 

 
j) The project Construction of Three (3)-Storey Information Technology (IT) 

Building, Mainit Campus costing P1,500,000.00 remained unfinished despite 
the expiration of the revised completion date of April 21, 2016, contrary to 
Item 4 of the Contract and Agreement signed by and between the Surigao 
State College of Technology (SSCT) and Kent Marketing Group of 
Companies Incorporated, and Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 
thus, deprived the intended beneficiaries from prompt availment of the 
benefits therefrom. Likewise, Management failed to impose appropriate 
actions and remedies pursuant to Section III-A (2.c.i) of the Guidelines on 
Termination of Contracts and Section 4.2.g. of the Uniform Guidelines for 
Blacklisting of Manufacturers, Suppliers, Distributors, Contractors and 
Consultant. 
 
We recommended that Management shall: (1) Instruct the BEO to inspect and 
reassess the completion rate of the project; (2) If found deficient, demand 
from the Contractor the immediate completion of the structure including the 
repairs/modification thereto, if needed, without incurring additional cost to 
SSCT; (3) Impose liquidated damages against the Contractor if warranted in 



   
 

accordance with Section 68 of the Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9184; (4) If justifiable under the 
circumstances, initiate termination of the Contract with Kent Marketing and 
issue Blacklisting Order against the latter.  Likewise, the performance security 
of the Contractor shall be forfeited; and (5) Ensure to include in the proposed 
budget for DBM approval an amount intended to prioritize the construction of 
the IT Building until the same is completed.  The Management may likewise 
resort to identified savings from other capital outlay budgetary items/accounts 
which may be requested from the DBM to be used to continue finish the 
project. 

 
k) Unnecessary cubicles/mini-rooms or structure were constructed/present in 

selected classrooms of the College not in accordance with Section 2 of 
Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Articles 41.5 and 114 of the College 
Code precluding SSCT to achieve full potential of their properties. 

 
We recommended that Management shall dismantle or demolish the 
unnecessary rooms or structures inside the classroom to give the latter full 
space/area where to hold student classes and/or office.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 
 

Hon. PERFECTO A. ALIBIN 
Chairperson, SSCT Board of Trustees 
Surigao State College of Technology 
Surigao City 
 
 
Qualified Opinion 
 
We have audited the financial statements of the Surigao State College of Technology, 
Surigao City, which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 
2020, and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net 
assets/equity, statement of cash flows and statement of comparison of budget and actual 
amounts for the year then ended, and notes to financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies. 
 

In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Bases for Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the Surigao State College of Technology as at 
December 31, 2020, and its financial performance and its cash flows, and its comparison 
of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 
 
Bases for Qualified of Opinion 
 
The accuracy and correctness of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Accounts 
(LCCA) balance of P384,398,755.77 as of year-end was doubtful due to: (a) Unadjusted 
and/or unsubstantiated reconciling items amounting to P55,452,479.77; (b) Non-
submission of the original copies of Credit Memoranda (CM)/Debit Memoranda (DM); 
and (c) Un-updated Cashbook maintained by the Cashier.  

 
The year-end balance of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges account amounting to 
P1,898,901.08 was misstated due to: (a) Failure by the Accounting Office to set-up 
receivables from audit disallowances/charges which had become final and executory with 
subject amount of P22,608,785.70; (b) Misclassification of restitutions from audit 
disallowances which were credited to Other Payables account instead of the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges totaling P19,693,709.15; (c) Unrecorded refunds from 
disallowances of Hazard Pay and Extra Bonus amounting to P706,208.16 and

P83,316.01, respectively, or a total of P789,524.17; and (d) The CY 2003 beginning 
balance of the account amounting to P492,924.34, as well as the transfer or debit of 
P12,683.02 in            CY 2005 were deficient of schedules and/or supporting documents, 
casting doubt on the accuracy, completeness and valuation thereof. 
 
The accuracy, existence, and completeness of the Inventory account with a year-end 
balance of P47,710,456.89 was doubtful due to: (a) Unreconciled Inventory balance 
between the Supply and Accounting Offices amounting to P38,275,485.51; and (b) Un-
updated Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Office.   
 
The accuracy, existence, and completeness of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
account with a year-end net value balance of P618,342,103.74 was doubtful due to: (a) 
Unreconciled PPE balance between the Supply and Accounting offices of 
P34,421,991.38; (b) Properties were not supported with Property Acknowledgement 
Receipt (PAR) amounting to P49,294,416.27; (c) Items found during physical count were 
not included in the Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE); (d) Items in the RPCPPE were not found during physical count with subject 
amount of P2,467,434.00; (e) Demolished properties were not dropped from the books or 
added to  the appropriate PPE account totaling P3,183,720.91; (f) Unrecognized donated 
properties; (g) Transferred PPEs from an Accountable Officer (AO) to another were not 
covered with Property Transfer Report (PTR) and PAR; and (h) Absence of list/report of 
the buildings and estates prepared and maintained by the BEO. 
 
The reported year-end balance of the Construction in Progress (CIP) – Buildings and 
Other Structures account of P150,533,478.76 was misstated by P35,927,904.44 which 
corresponds to: (a) A completed Improvement & Repair of Poultry Building which was 
still included in the account and was not reclassified to the appropriate Property, Plant 
and Equipment (PPE) account amounting to P856,909.62; (b) Capitalizable 
betterments/enhancements costs incurred during the construction of SSCT’s 
infrastructures which were not directly recorded under the appropriate PPE account 
totaling P20,590,928.52; and (c) Two (2) On-going development projects which were 
misclassified under the CIP- Buildings and Other Structures account instead of the 
appropriate CIP account totaling P14,480,066.30.  Moreover, the Accounting Office did 
not prepare and maintain CIP-Ledger Cards in which the balance of the CIP – Buildings 
and Other Structures account did not reconcile with the records being kept by the BEO 
for the purpose showing a variance of P24,986,872.06, thus casting doubt on the 
accuracy, completeness and valuation thereof. 
 
Trust receipts under the Trust Fund of the College amounting to P105,111,177.33 were 
credited and misclassified to Other Payables Account instead of the following appropriate 
Payable accounts: (a) Due to NGAs – P61,890,280.15; (b) Due to LGU – P4,457,779.72; 
(c) Trust Liabilities – P38,436,476.07; and (d) Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable - 
P326,641.39 resulting in overstatements/ understatements of the affected accounts, thus 
misstating the financial statements. 



3 
 

The refund of disallowances/charges in audit and receipts of liquidated damages totaling 
P20,308,772.36 were misclassified to Other Payables Account instead of a credit to: (a) 
Receivable – Disallowances/Charges totaling P19,693,709.15; and (b) Income/ 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in the amount of P615,063.21 resulting in overstatements/ 
understatements of the affected accounts, thereby misstating the financial statements. 
 
The reported balance of Intangible Assets amounting to P11,499,224.18 was misstated 
due to failure of the Management to amortize the same in the books. Moreover, the 
prescribed disclosures of the Assets were not presented in the Notes to Financial 
Statements for the period covered, precluding the users of the FS to obtain other relevant 
information thereof. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
qualified opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters  
 
Except for the matter described in the Bases for Qualified Opinion section, we have 
determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.  
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements 
 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 
statements in accordance with the IPSASs, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the College’ financial 
reporting process. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high-level 
assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.

1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 

The financial statements of Surigao State College of Technology were authorized 
to be prepared as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for 
Financial Statements signed by Dr. Gregorio Z. Gamboa, Jr. College President on

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements  
 

The detailed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the 
Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014. 
 
The Detailed Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of historical 
costs, unless stated otherwise, and in accordance with Government Accounting 
Manual (GAM). The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.  

 
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1 Basis of accounting 
 
The agency uses accrual basis of accounting.  All expenses are recognized when 
incurred and reported in the financial statements in the period to which they relate. 
Income is on accrual basis except for transactions where accrual basis is impractical 
or when other methods are required by law. The Modified Obligation System is 
used to record allotments received and obligations incurred. Separate registries are 
maintained to control allotments and obligations for each class of allotments. 

 
3.2 Consolidation 
 

a. Consolidated Entities/Controlled Entities 
 

The financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and 
expenses of the reporting entity and all controlled entities. 
 

The controlled entities are all those entities (including special purpose 
entities) over which the controlling entity has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies. The controlled entities are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the controlling 
entity. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 



   
 

13 
 

Inter-group transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on 
transactions between members of the group are eliminated in full.The 
accounting policies of the controlled entities are consistent with the policies 
adopted by the controlling entity. 
 
The controlled entities are SSCT – Malimono Campus, formerly Malimono 
School of Fisheries, Malimono, Surigao del Norte; SSCT – Del Carmen 
Campus, formerly Siargao National College of Science and Technology, 
Del Carmen, Surigao del Norte; and SSCT- Mainit Campus, the newly 
created Campus during its separation from Surigao Norte College of 
Agriculture of Technology, Mainit, Surigao del Norte. All entities are fully 
consolidated. 

 
3.3  Financial Instruments 

 

a. Financial assets 
 

Initial Recognition and Measurement 
 
The SSCT’s financial assets include cash and short-term deposits; trade and 
other receivables; loans and other receivables. 
 
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification. 

  
b. Financial Liabilities 
 

Initial Recognition and Measurement 
 

The SSCT’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables. 
 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification. 

 
3.4  Cash and cash equivalents 

 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank deposits 
on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three

8. Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

 
 

Increases of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts were due to additional 
purchases made by the College and donations received. Decreases in other PPE 
were mainly due to reclassification of PPE accounts to their proper account 
classification. 
 

The regular Physical count of the three campuses, to be witnessed by the resident 
auditor or his representative, is scheduled at the end of the School Year instead of 
the Calendar Year to facilitate smooth conduct of such undertaking. Regular 
maintenance, repairs and minor replacements were charged against Maintenance 
and Other Operating Expenses as these were incurred. 
 
Depreciation Expenses is computed/charged only for PPEs (except land) that were 
acquired during CY 2018. This is computed with a 95 percent book value, thus 
retaining 5 percent salvage value as stated in the Government Accounting Manual. 
No cumulative reduction in value of PPEs thru charging of Depreciation Expense 
and recognizing Accumulated Depreciation, were computed for PPE acquired prior 
to CY 2017.

f. Due to GOCCs 
 

The Due to Other Government Owned and/or Controlled Corporations 
account includes funds advanced or entrusted by government corporations 
to finance specific projects or activities & amounts withheld from 
employees for the account of government corporations other than GSIS, 
PHILHEALTH and PAG-IBIG, amounting to P48,225.63. 

 
 
14. Other Payables 
 

The Other Payables Account amounting to P133,993,468.74 pertains to other 
liabilities not falling under any of the specific payable accounts. These are mainly 
composed of receipts withheld in Trust account. 
 
The reflected item lumped as “unadjusted balance” of the Other Payables account 
amounting to P2,815,659.20 has no breakdown due to the absence of supporting 
documents from CY 2003 before the implementation of the New Government 
Accounting System (NGAS) which until now serves as a perennial problem to the 
College on how to validate adjustments and of how to make the necessary 
correction.  
 
Other Payables with negative balance are subject for adjustment for the succeeding 
months due to either erroneous posting in the subsidiary ledger or wrong account 
code used.  

 

 

15.  Guaranty Security Deposits payable 

 

The Guaranty/ Security Deposits Payable amounting to P16,054,129.66 pertains to

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Doubtful Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Accounts Balance 
 
1. The accuracy and correctness of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current 

Accounts (LCCA) balance of P384,398,755.77 as of year-end was doubtful due 

to: (a) Unadjusted and/or unsubstantiated reconciling items amounting to 

P55,452,479.77; (b) Non-submission of the original copies of Credit 
Memoranda (CM)/Debit Memoranda (DM); and (c) Un-updated Cashbook 

maintained by the Cashier contrary to Sections 74 and 111 of Presidential 

Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I.  

 
1.1 Section 74 of P.D. No. 1445 requires that “At the close of the month, 

depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, 
the condition of the agency account in their books.  The agency head shall 
see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the report 
and the balance found in the books of the agency.”  Moreover, Section 111 
of the same mandates that “The accounts of the agency shall be kept in such 
detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 
adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of 
the government.  The highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard 
against inaccurate or misleading information.” 

 
1.2 Meanwhile, Sections 5 and 6, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I 

provides that “The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days 
from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid 
checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda 
(CM) from the bank, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare BRS in four 
copies. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to 
recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in 
the books of accounts.” 

 
1.3 Records showed that the balance of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, 

Current Accounts (LCCA) as of December 31, 2020 totaled 
P384,398,755.77 which is composed of seven (7) depository accounts all 
maintained at the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), Surigao City Branch 
corresponding to the seven (7) funds maintained by the School.  The details 
are as follow:

Total P    384,398,755.77 

 
1.4 The audit of the above-mentioned account disclosed the following: 

 
a) Existence of unadjusted and/or unsubstantiated reconciling items 

in the BRS  
 

1.4.1 The examination of the CY 2020 Bank Reconciliation Statements 
(BRS) submitted to COA disclosed among others the existence of 
unadjusted reconciling items totaling P55,412,667.20 which 
covered transactions like debit and credit memoranda and book 
errors which require addition or deduction from the book balance.  
Some of these variances already appeared in the BRS in CY 2011 or 
almost 10 years of non-adjustment in the books.  The audit further 
revealed that several of these reconciling items which consists 
mainly of credit and debit memoranda totaling P55,142,373.93 were 
unsubstantiated with the required documents to warrant recognition 
thereof in the books like disbursement vouchers (DVs), paid checks, 
accounting reports, cashier’s reports, official receipts, validated 
deposit slips and all other documents necessary in the validation.  
The accounting and cashier’s office did not exert reasonable effort 
to obtain information regarding the transactions and secure the 
required documents so that the items will be recorded in the books.  
The summary of the foregoing is as follow and which details are 
presented in the attached schedule marked as Annex A:

TOTAL P 55,412,667.20 

 
 
 



   
 

44 
 

b) Non-submission of the original copies of CM/DM  
 

1.4.2 The review of the CY 2020 BRS submitted by the Accountant 
showed that the Statements were not supported with the original 
copies of the CM/DM which will give detailed information to the 
credit and debit reconciling items reflected in the bank statements.  
These memoranda are integral part in verifying whether the 
unrecorded credit and/or debit financial transactions would warrant 
adjustment in the books as well as the proper accounting treatment 
thereof in the record.  Thus, the absence of these memoranda 
precluded the Auditor to establish the foregoing-mentioned 
objectives. 

 
c) Un-updated Cashier’s Cashbook   
 
1.4.3 It was disclosed during audit that the Cashbooks maintained by the 

College Cashier were not updated as of year-end, precluding the 
Auditor to reconcile the balances of the Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Accounts, especially the Cash in Bank – LCCA, with that of the 
Ledger balances maintained by the Accountant.  

 
1.5 In accounting parlance, Reconciliation is an accounting process that 

compares two sets of records to check that figures are correct and in 
agreement. The account reconciliation also confirms that the accounts in the 
general ledger are consistent, accurate, and complete.  Thus, failure of the 
Cashier to update her books hindered the Auditor to ascertain whether the 
balances of the Cash Accounts maintained by the Accountant and the former 
are free from errors and misstatements. 

 
1.6 During interview, the Accountant explained that, as regards the unadjusted 

and unsubstantiated reconciling items, these mainly consists of the credit 
and debit financial transactions which they found difficult to effect in the 
books due to absence of the CM/DM from the bank.  She said that the 
documents would have given them complete information surrounding the 
transactions for their proper accounting treatment.  The Cashier’s office had 
likewise no knowledge about these unknown inflows and outflows from the 
School’s depository accounts.  With regard the unrecorded but substantiated 
reconciling items, the accounting personnel said that, although these 
transactions have substantial documents to support the same, he was still 
contemplating on the correct accounting entry to be made therefrom.  On 
the other hand, the Cashier justified that her failure to update the cashbooks 
was due to the late availment by her office of the new set of books and her 
prioritization to record transactions covered by the cash examination. 

 
1.7 Evidently, the above-mentioned practices run counter the provisions of 

Sections 74 and 111 of P.D. No. 1445 and Sections 5 and 6, Chapter 21 of 



   
 

45 
 

the GAM for NGAs, Volume I rendering the Cash in Bank –LCCA account 
balance of P384,398,755.77 as of December 31, 2020 doubtful as to 
accuracy and correctness. 

 
 1.8 We recommended that Management shall: 

• Request in writing the LBP to furnish the former original copies of 
the CM/DM involving financial transactions of the depository 

accounts maintained at the latter; 

 

• Advise the Accountant to immediately record in the books all the 
reconciling items sourcing information from the availed CM/DM 

from the bank and other available documents; and 

 

• Require the Cashier to update her Cashbooks regularly as required 
by law. 

 

 Management Comment(s) 
  
 1.9 During the exit conference, the Management said that the audit 

recommendations are positively accepted.  The College President added that the 
College will resend a letter-request to LBP or will personally talk with its bank 
manager to furnish the former the copies of the CM/DM.  Moreover, in the 
Management’s letter-reply, the Accountant said that they are still waiting for the 
depository bank to give them the requested copy of the CM/DM.  She added that 
the adjustments and reconciliations will be made in the books as soon as her office 
will obtain the necessary documents as basis for the action.

Misstatement of Receivable-Disallowances/Charges Account Balance  
 
2. The year-end balance of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges account 

amounting to P1,898,901.08 was misstated due to: (a) Failure by the 

Accounting Office to set-up receivables from audit disallowances/charges 

which had become final and executory with subject amount of P22,608,785.70; 

(b) Misclassification of restitutions from audit disallowances which were 

credited to Other Payables account instead of the Receivable-

Disallowances/Charges totaling P19,693,709.15; (c) Unrecorded refunds from 

disallowances of Hazard Pay and Extra Bonus amounting to P706,208.16 and 

P83,316.01, respectively, or a total of P789,524.17; and (d) The CY 2003 

beginning balance of the account amounting to P492,924.34, as well as the 

transfer or debit of P12,683.02 in CY 2005 were deficient of schedules and/or 

supporting documents, contrary to Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree 

(P.D.) No. 1445, Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting 

Standards (IPSAS) No. 1, Section 46, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I and Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 

III, thus casting doubt on the accuracy, completeness and valuation thereof.  

 

2.1  Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445 mandates that “The accounts of the agency 
shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and 
at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or 
control agencies of the government.  The highest standard of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to 
safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.”  Section 112 of 
the Decree requires that “Each government Agency to record its financial 
transactions and operation conformably with PPSAS and in accordance 
with pertinent laws and regulations.” 
 

2.2 Paragraph 27 of IPSAS No. 1 states that “The financial statements shall 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows 
of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses set out in IPSASs.” 

 

2.3 Likewise, Section 46, Chapter 5 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that 
“Disallowances shall be taken up in the books of accounts only when they 
become final and executory. The Accountant shall prepare the JEV to take 
up the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges and credit the appropriate 
account for the current year or Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account if 
pertaining to expenses of previous years.” 

  



   
 

47 
 

2.4 Moreover, Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) prescribed in Chapter 3 of 
GAM for NGAs Volume III provides the description of Receivables-
Disallowances as follows: 

 
Accounting Title  Receivables-Disallowances/Charges 
Account Number  10305010 
Normal Balance  Debit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

amount of disallowances/charges in

final and executory. Credit this account 
for settlement of disallowances/ 
charges.  
 

2.5 However, the financial statements of the College showed Receivable-
Disallowances/ Charges account with a balance of P1,898,901.08 as of 
December 31, 2020.  The existence of the account was due to the 
recognition in the books by the Accountant of the disallowances and/or 
charges issued by the Auditor, as a result of his audit, for disclosed 
illegal/irregular, unnecessary, extravagant, excessive and unconscionable 
disbursements/receipts of the Agency which have become final and 
executory.  This account is correspondingly credited for any refund or 
restitutions made by the persons determined to be liable for the disallowed 
transactions 
 

2.6 The audit of the above-mentioned account, however, disclosed the 
following observations: 
 
a) Failure by the Accounting Office to set-up receivables from audit 

disallowances/charges 
 

The general ledger for the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges 
account obtained from the accounting office showed transactions 
relating thereto covering CYs 2003 - 2020.   Included information 
in the ledger are the beginning balance in CY 2003, the recorded 
disallowance of hazard pay during that year, and the disallowed 
honoraria to the board secretary and collective negotiation 
agreement (CNA) in CY 2015. Likewise indicated in the ledger are 
the refunds made in CYs 2006-2007 for the disallowance on extra 
bonus, as well as the recognition of audit disallowances and 
restitutions from satellite campuses during transfer of accounts in 
CY 2015.  The summary of the foregoing is presented in the table

2.6.1 However, review of pertinent documents disclosed that there were 
five (5) notices of disallowance that had become final and executory 
and with subject amount of P22,608,785.70 that were not recognized 
in the books, as follow: 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

2.6.2 The ND No. 2003-001-101 (2002) dated April 23, 2003 was issued 
to the Management as a result of audit on the payment of extra bonus 
which was found wanting of legal basis. The disallowance was 
appealed by the College before the Commission on Audit in which 
the same was denied for lack of legal basis until a COA Order of 
Execution (COE) was issued thereto by the latter on February 8, 2017

it being final and executory.  Meanwhile, ND No. 2003-005-101 
(2001) dated July 28, 2003 was issued by the Auditor due to the 
disclosed variance in the reported accomplishment of perimeter 
fencing between the records of the college and COA’s technical 
inspection.  The disallowance was again appealed by the College 
which was denied by the Commission until a COE was issued 
thereto on April 17, 2017.  Moreover, the disallowances on 
Collective Performance Incentive Bonus (CPIB) was issued by COA 
due to lack of legal basis.  Due to non-appeal by the Management, 
the NDs had become final and executory on December 8, 2016 for 
ND Nos. 2015-01 STF (2012-2013) and 2015-02 IGP (2012-2013) 
and on February 8, 2017 for ND No. 2015-03 LENDING (2012-
2013). 

 
b) Misclassification of refunds from disallowances which were 

credited to Other Payables account instead of Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges 

 
2.6.3 The general ledger of the Other Payables account as of year-end 

indicated, among others, a credit of P19,693,709.15 which 
represents refund or restitutions from audit disallowances.  The 
refunds were collected from the liable persons through payroll 
deduction and which was eventually transferred to the depository 
account under the trust fund. These remittances were then 
recognized by the Accountant in the Trust Fund by crediting the 
Other Payables account instead of the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges account under the specific fund from where 
the illegal or irregular disbursement was charged/drawn.  The

c) Unrecorded restitutions for the disallowances of Hazard Pay and 

Extra Bonus totaling P789,524.17 
 

2.6.4 Further, it was noted that the disallowance on Hazard Pay had 
corresponding restitutions of P12,000.00 as of December 31, 2020. 
However, perusal of the Remittance List from the Accounting Unit 
as of December 31, 2020, the disallowed amount had been restituted 
by P718,208.16 (Annex B).  Thus, the remaining refund of 
P706,208.16 was not recognized in the books.  Moreover, the 
disallowed grant of Extra Bonus totaling P1,221,300 had 
corresponding total restitutions recorded in the books of 
P1,137,983.99 as indicated in the ledger.  It was learned however 
that the disallowance had long been fully settled as evidenced by the 
Statement of Remittance as of July 31, 2012 which was prepared by 
the Accountant (Annex C) and the Certification of Full Settlement 
dated November 6, 2015 signed by the former President of the 
College (Annex D).  This only showed that the balance of 
P83,316.01 was not recorded in the books of accounts.  This 
represents the last refund made under check number 118711 dated 
June 11, 2008 amounting to P71,223.93, the restitution that was used 
to pay the magna carta benefits to public health workers in the 
amount of P15,000.00, and the adjustment to be made in the books 
due to erroneous recording of restitution under check number 
584938 dated October 14, 2004 with subject amount of P2,907.92.

d) Unsubstantiated amounts/balances 
 
2.6.5 Further verification of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges 

account disclosed that the CY 2003 beginning balance of the 
account amounting to P492,924.34, as well as the transferred 
accounts from the SNCST (Del Carmen Campus) to the City 
Campus which showed a debit in the ledger of P12,683.02 could not 
be substantiated due to deficiency in schedules and/or supporting 
documents. The amounts were merely sourced from the general 
ledgers and no other supporting documents could be retrieved and 
presented.   

 
2.6.6 When inquired on the matter, the Accountant admitted the 

deficiencies and will rectify the books as needed.  She added that, as 
regards the crediting of the restitutions to Other Payables account 
instead of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges, it has been the 
practice of her office to deposit the installment payments of 
restitutions to the Trust Fund which eventually be transferred to the 
appropriate fund when fully paid.  With regard to the 
unsubstantiated balances in the ledger, the Accountant explained 
that these can no longer be traced because pertinent schedules and 
supporting documents thereof such as journals, vouchers and reports 
were absent and were destroyed through time.   

 
2.7. The foregoing deficiencies were incongruent with the prescribed guidelines 

provided in Sections 111 and 112 of P.D. No. 1445, Section 27 of PPSAS 
No. 1, Section 46, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Chapter 3 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume III, misstating the Receivable-
Disallowances/Charges account at year-end by P43,092,019.02. The non-
recognition in the books of receivables from disallowances likewise 



   
 

52 
 

misstated the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by P22,608,785.70.  
Moreover, the absence of schedules and/or supporting documents for the 
CY 2003 beginning balance of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges 
account amounting to P492,924.34, as well as the transfer or debit of 
P12,683.02 in CY 2005 casted doubt on the accuracy, completeness and 
valuation of the year-end balance thereof. 

 
 2.8 We recommended that Management shall: 
 

• Direct the Accountant to make adjusting entries in the books to: (a) 
Recognize receivables from audit disallowances/charges which had 

become final and executory with subject amount of P22,608,785.70; 

(b) Reclassify the restitutions from audit disallowances totaling 

P19,693,709.15 which were credited to Other Payables account 

instead of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges.  Installment 

payments of refunds should not be deposited in the Trust Fund and 

credited to Other Payables account, rather, the same shall be 

credited to the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges account and 
deposited directly to the Fund where these correspondingly 

charged/drawn; and (c) Record the refunds from disallowances of 

Hazard Pay and Extra Bonus amounting to P706,208.16 and 

P83,316.01, respectively, or a total of P789,524.17; and  

 

• Advise the Accountant to exert more effort in gathering documents 
to provide schedule or substantiate the CY 2003 beginning balance 

of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges account amounting to 

P492,924.34, as well as the transfer or debit of P12,683.02 in             

CY 2005.  

 

 Management Comment(s) 
 

2.9 In her letter-reply, the Accountant said that all the audit recommendations 
were duly considered and will comply thereof to correct the deficiencies.  
She added that as regards the balances that have no corresponding 
documents or schedules, best efforts had already been exerted to gather 
relevant documents to substantiate the said balances but only proved futile.  
Nevertheless, all the suggested adjustments to be made in the books will be 
processed. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 
2.10 May we further recommend that end to furnish the Auditor the documents 

or reports showing the procedures previously undertaken to substantiate the 
balances said to be deficient of schedules and supporting documents.  The 
Team will evaluate thereon to determine the reasonability of the actions 
taken. 



   
 

53 
 

Doubtful Inventories Account  
 

3 The accuracy, existence, and completeness of the Inventory account with a 
year-end balance of P47,710,456.89 was doubtful due to: (a) Unreconciled 

Inventory balance between the Supply and Accounting Offices amounting to 

P38,275,485.51; and (b) Un-updated Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the 

Accounting Office, contrary to Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 

1445, Chapter 5 of the Property & Supply Management System Handbook, 

and Section 17, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

NGS, Volume I.  Moreover, the Management showed weak internal control in 

the custodianship of their supplies and inventories as evidenced by: (c) The 

issued semi-expendable properties were not supported with Inventory 

Custodian Slip (ICS) with subject amount of P6,855,297.37; (d) Non-

preparation and maintenance of list or record of issued semi-expendable 

properties for satellite/extension campuses; (e) Not readily verifiable items in 

the list/record of issued semi-expendable properties for the city/main campus; 

(f) Items found during physical count but not included in the list of issued semi-

expendable properties; and (g) Issued semi-expendable properties were 

covered with Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) instead of ICS, not in 

accordance with Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 11, Chapter 8 of GAM 

for NGS, Volume I, subjecting the resources of the School to possible loss or 

misuse.   

 

3.1 Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that it is the responsibility of the head 
of the government agency to faithfully adhere to the declared policy of the 
state that all resources of the government shall be managed, expensed or 
utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss 
or wastage.  Also, Section 111 of the Decree states that “The accounts of an 
agency should be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the 
agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed 
by fiscal or control agencies of the government. The highest standards of 
honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of 
accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.” 

 

3.2 Moreover, Chapter 5 of the Property and Supply Management Handbook 
provides the control in instilling diligence in the custodianship of 
government property.  Among the controls indicated therein are:  

 
i. The indispensable/mandatory conduct by the chief agencies of 

inventory taking of all its equipment and supplies.  Supplies and 
materials in stock, including medicines, drugs and medical 
supplies for either commissary, sales, manufacture or relief 
purposes should be inventoried at least every six (6) months as of 
June 30 and December 31 of each year; and  
 
 



   
 

54 
 

ii. Reconciliation of the results of the count with the property and 
accounting records. 

 

3.3 Meanwhile, Section 11, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
necessitates the issuance of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) to end-user of 
semi-expendable property to establish accountability over them. 
Accountability shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the Property 
and Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from 
property accountability.  Likewise, Section 17, Chapter 8 of the same GAM 
requires among others the use of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) to record 
materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at 
any time, maintained by the Accounting Office. 

 
3.4 Records showed that the Inventory account of the College had a year-end 

balance of P47,710,456.89 which consists of the following summarized 
properties: 

  
No. Property Amount 
1 Merchandise Inventory  P    8,007,332.72

3.5 The audit conducted on the foregoing mentioned inventories, as well as 

witnessing the physical count performed thereof by the Management 
disclosed the following: 

  



   
 

55 
 

a) Unreconciled Inventory balance between the Supply and 
Accounting offices 

 
3.5.1 It was disclosed during audit that the Inventory account balances of 

the Accounting and Supply offices did not reconcile showing a 
variance of P38,275,485.51 which was attributed to the failure of the 
Inventory Team to include during the physical count 9 out of the 14 
inventory line items, as shown in the table below:

b) Un-updated Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) 

 
3.5.2 Further, review of the records maintained by the Accounting Office 

for Inventories account, we noted that the SLCs, which is a form 
used to record all receipts and issues made for each type of supplies, 
and which is to be reconciled with the stock cards balances by the 
Supply Office, was not updated as of year-end, thus, any 
discrepancies could not be immediately verified and adjusted.

c) Inventory items not supported with ICS 
 
3.5.3 Evaluation of the list of issued semi-expandable properties of the 

College disclosed that there were 3,825 items currently located and 
used by various offices or personnel of the institution were not 
covered with ICS. These cover items for communication equipment, 
furniture and fixtures, information and communication technology 
equipment, machinery, medical equipment, office equipment, other 
machinery & equipment, and supplies and materials inventory. The 
summary of the foregoing is presented below:

d) Absence of list or record of issued semi-expendable properties for 

satellite/extension campuses 
 
3.5.4 It was disclosed during audit that the Supply Office did not prepare 

and maintain a list of issued semi-expendable properties to the 
satellite campuses, including their lone extension campus.  The only 
list of said properties made by the Office are for the items issued to 
various users or personnel in the city or main campus.  This is a 
manifestation of a weak internal control administered by the College 
by not ensuring that all its semi-expendable properties are strictly 
monitored against possible loss and/or misuse. 

 



   
 

57 
 

e) Not readily verifiable items in the list/record of issued semi-
expendable properties for the city/main campus 

 
3.5.5 Perusal of the Supply Office’ list of issued semi-expendable 

properties for the main/city campus showed that the same were not 
readily verifiable against the items found on hand.  It was noted that 
most of the listed properties were not given specific description like 
brand name, color, model, serial number, cost and other distinctive 
features like size, shape, number of layers, columns, etc.  Rather, 
these issued items were just provided with generic name and 
description that one could not specifically identify the object, with 
absolute certainty, that it is the one referring to by the item found 
during the physical count.  This is likewise showing a break down 
in internal control since the existence and completeness of the 
School properties could not be immediately ascertained. 

 
f) Items found during physical count but not included in the list of 

issued semi-expendable properties 
 
3.5.6 Further, it was disclosed during physical count that there were 875 

issued semi-expendable items, found on hand, and currently used by 
the offices/personnel in the main or city campus but were not 
included in the list maintained by the Supply Office for monitoring, 
and which is summarized below:

g) Issuance of PAR instead of ICS for items below P15,000.00 
 
3.5.7 Review of the acknowledgment forms covering the issuance to end 

users of the semi-expandable properties, it was observed that there 
were 293 items which each unit costs below P15,000.00 were issued 
with PAR instead of an ICS, as shown in the table below:

3.6 When inquired on the foregoing-mentioned observations, the following 

were the comments of the concerned personnel: 
 

• Unreconciled Inventory balance between the Supply and Accounting 
offices 

 

3.6.1 The Supply Office explained that there was no reconciliation made 
for the Inventory balances between the supply and accounting 
offices because the person in-charged for the account in each office 
had a hard time of meeting their schedules for the purpose.   

 

• Non-conduct of complete physical count of inventories 
 

3.6.2 The Supply Officer said that it was not really practiced by the 
management in previous years to conduct physical count of all is 
inventories, only the PPEs. 

 

• Un-updated Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) by the Accounting Office 
 

3.6.3 The Accountant explained that the in-charged for the updating of the 
SLCs was transferred to another office during the CY 2020 mid-year 
reshuffling instituted by the School.  From then on, no one yet in the 
accounting office has been designated to perform the job. 

 
• Inventory items not supported with ICS 

 

3.6.4 The Supply Officer said that her office is on the process of updating 
all the ICSs for the inventories due to the recent reshuffling the 
school had instituted. 

 

• Non-preparation and maintenance of list or record of issued semi-
expendable properties for satellite/extension campuses 

 

3.6.5 The Office Officer admitted the deficiency.  She added that the said 
list is one of the documents her office is updating due to the recent 
change in the treatment of semi-expendable properties in the records 



   
 

59 
 

of the supply and accounting offices in which, the same shall be 
derecognized from the property, plant and equipment account and 
will be expensed instead when issued. 

 
• Not readily verifiable items in the list/record of issued semi-

expendable properties for the city/main campus 
 

3.6.6 The Supply Office admitted the deficiency and will rectify its 
records immediately. 

 

• Items found during physical count but not included in the list of 
issued semi-expendable properties 

 

3.6.7 The Supply Office said that they will recheck their records vis-à-vis 
the schedule prepared by COA on the matter.  The Supply Officer 
added that these properties might be those items that were identified 
as unserviceable and therefore dropped from the books/records, but 
due to some repairs and modifications made by the School, these 
became reusable for office use or instructional materials.  

 

• Issuance of PAR instead of ICS for items below P15,000.00 
 

3.6.8 The Supply Officer said that this was overlooked and inadvertently 
done.  The matter will be resolved immediately. 

 
3.7 The existence of variances in inventory records between supply and 

accounting offices, the non-conduct of complete physical count and the un-
updated inventory ledgers run counter Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445, 
Chapter 5 of the Property & Supply Management System Handbook and 
Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGS, Volume I which render the 
Inventory account balance of P47,710,456.89 doubtful as to accuracy, 
existence, and completeness.  

 
3.8 Moreover, the absence of ICS for issued semi-expendable properties, lack 

of list or record of issued semi-expendable properties, non-readily verifiable 
items in the list/record of issued semi-expendable properties, incomplete 
items in the list of issued semi-expendable properties; and covering PAR, 
instead of ICS for issued semi-expendable properties, were contrary to 
Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 11, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGS, 
Volume I, and   manifestation of weak internal control in the custodianship 
of government properties, subjecting the same to possible loss or misuse.  

  
 
 
 
 



   
 

60 
 

3.9 We recommended that Management require: 

 

• The Accounting and Supply offices to reconcile their Inventory 
records as mandated in Chapter 5 of the Property and Supply 

Management Handbook; 

 

• The Inventory Team to conduct physical count of all the School’s 
inventory at least semi-annually, June 30 and December 31 of each 

year, and submit the corresponding RPCI to the supply office, 

including the Audit Team; 

 

• The Accountant to update the SLCs as required in Section 17, 
Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs; 

 

• The Supply Officer to finish, as soon as possible, the updating of the 
ICSs covering the issued semi-expendable properties, and to 

prepare the same to every property acquired and issued to end 

users; 
 

• The Supply Officer to prepare and maintain a list showing all and 
complete, with specific and readily-verifiable information, issued 

semi-expandable properties for monitoring purposes.  This is in 

accordance with Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 11, Chapter 

8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

• The Supply Officer to prepare and issue ICS, instead of PAR, for 
all issued semi-expendable items. 

 
Management Comment(s) 
 
3.10 In their reply letter, the Supply Officer accepted the noted deficiencies and 

will comply the audit recommendations to rectify the same.  On the other 
hand, the Accountant, in her separate answer, said that variance of the 
Inventories account between the Supply and Accounting offices existed 
because the former did not furnish the latter the reports on dropped items 
from the former’s records.  As regards the non-maintenance of SLCs, she 
said that at present, her office has no specific personnel assigned to do the 
job.  The accounting staff have multiple workloads that they could not 
attend the updating of the same. As it is prepared manually, the said task 
requires lots of time.  Nevertheless, the Accountant said that they will do 
their best to comply with the audit recommendations. 

 
 
 
 
 



   
 

61 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder  
 
3.11 The non-submission by the supply to the accounting of the reports on 

dropped items could not have been the reason of discrepancies since the 
issuance of the items from the latter’s office to the end users were duly 
covered with RSMIs which were completely furnished to the accounting.  
The accounting office does not and will no longer have records on issued 
items which still be strictly monitored by the supply.  As regards the non-
updating of SLCs, the accounting should assign a personnel in her office to 
do the job as the preparation and maintenance of ledgers is a primary 
responsibility of her office to support balances in the financial statements. 

 

 

Unreliable Property, Plant and Equipment Account  
 
4.  The accuracy, existence, and completeness of the Property, Plant and 

Equipment (PPE) account with a year-end net value balance of 

P618,342,103.74 was doubtful due to: (a) Unreconciled PPE balance between 

the Supply and Accounting offices of P34,421,991.38; (b) Properties were not 

supported with Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) amounting to 

P49,294,416.27; (c) Items found during physical count were not included in the 

Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (d) 

Items in the RPCPPE were not found during physical count with subject 

amount of P2,467,434.00; (e) Demolished properties were not dropped from 

the books or added to  the appropriate PPE account totaling P3,183,720.91; (f) 

Unrecognized donated properties; (g) Transferred PPEs from an Accountable 

Officer (AO) to another were not covered with Property Transfer Report 

(PTR) and PAR; and (h) Absence of list/report of the buildings and estates 

prepared and maintained by the BEO, not in accordance with Section 111 of 

Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, Paragraph 30 of International Public 

Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) No. 17, Sections 3, 12, 13, 21 and 42, 

Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs,      

Volume I.      
        

4.1 Section 111 of P.D. 1445 requires that “The accounts of an agency shall be 
kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at 
the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or 
control agencies of the government. The highest standards of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to 
safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.”  

 
4.2 Paragraph 30 of IPSAS No. 17 on PPE provides that “The initial estimate 

of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the 
item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a 
particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that 
period,” can be capitalized and added to the cost of an item of PPE. 



   
 

62 
 

4.3 Meanwhile, Section 3, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that 
“The cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and only if: (a) 
it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; (b) the cost or fair value of 
the item can be measured reliably; (c) beneficial ownership and control 
clearly rest with the government; (d) the asset is used to achieve government 
objectives; and (e) it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.” 

 
4.4 Likewise, Sections 12 and 13, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I 

provide that acquired properties through donations, either with conditions 
or not, should be taken up in the books. 

 
4.5 Moreover, Section 21, Chapter 10 of the said GAM mandates “the Supply 

and/or Property Custodian to prepare the Property Acknowledgement 
Receipt (PAR) to support the issue of property to end-user. The PAR shall 
be renewed at least every three years or every time there is a change in 
accountability or custodianship of the property.” 

 
4.6 Lastly, Section 42, Chapter 10 of the same GAM requires among others the: 
 

a. Use of Property Transfer Report (PTR) when there are transfers 
of property from one Accountable Officer/Agency/Fund Cluster to 
another Accountable Officer/Agency/Fund Cluster;  

b. Preparation of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant 
and Equipment or RPCPPE to report the physical count and 
condition of properties by type as at a given period, including 
those which are unrecorded and those which could not be 
accounted for;  

c. Preparation of Report of Loss, Stolen, Damaged or Destroyed 
Property to report or notify the concerned officials or office of the 
lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed property; and  

 
d. Reconciliation of the property cards balances by the Property and 

Supply Office/Unit with the PPE ledger cards balances 
maintained by the Accounting Office. 

 
4.7 Records showed that the PPE account of the College had a year-end balance 

of P618,342,106.74, net of accumulated depreciation which consists of the 
following summarized properties: 

 
No. Property Amount

Total P 618,342,106.74  

 
4.8 Review and analysis of pertinent documents and reports on the foregoing 

mentioned properties, as well as observations made during the physical 
count performed thereof by the Management disclosed the following: 

 
a) Unreconciled PPE balance between the Supply and Accounting 

offices 
 
4.8.1 It was disclosed during audit that the PPE account balances of the 

Accounting and Supply offices, gross of accumulated depreciation, 
did not reconcile showing a variance of P34,421,991.38.  It was 
further revealed that the amount was specifically attributed to the 
unreconciled balances of the Machinery and Equipment, 
Transportation Equipment, and Furniture, Fixtures and Books 
between the PPE ledger cards of the accounting and the property 
cards of the supply.  The details of the foregoing are as follow: 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

b) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) not supported with PAR 
 
4.8.2 Evaluation of the properties listed in the RPCPPE showed that there 

were 1,342 items with subject amount of P49,294,416.27 were not 
covered with PAR which consists of several PPE items issued to 
various SSCT employees assigned in the main campus or in the 
satellite campuses.  During the physical count, the subject properties 
were found in the specific location and under the custody of 
corresponding employee.  However, it was noted thereafter that the 
said properties were not supported with the required PAR.  The 
summary of the foregoing is shown in the next page:

4.8.3 During the physical count of PPEs conducted by the Management, 

it was noted by the Audit Team that there were 107 properties found 
in the location but were not included in the RPCPPE or the list 
provided by the Inventory Team where to source the property to be 
verified.  These properties were composed of office equipment, 
information and communication equipment and technical and 
scientific equipment, summarized below:

4.8.4 It was likewise disclosed during audit of the PPEs and witnessing 

the physical count thereof that a total of 47 items with subject 
amount of P2,467,434.00 were included in the RPCPPE or list of 
properties prepared and maintained by the Supply but the same were

not actually found and counted as observed by the Auditor.  These 
properties, which composed of information and communication 
equipment, technical and scientific equipment and books, were 
alleged to be in custody of a specific SSCT employee or office, but 
the same were not found and counted during inspection.  Moreover, 
verification of the subject PPEs with the same kind equipment found 
at the respective station cannot be made since the former were 
deficient of distinguishing specifications like the brand name, 
property number and serial number.  The summary of the foregoing 
is as follows:

4.8.5 One building, 13 school buildings, and one other structure with 

subject amount of P3,183,720.91 that were demolished, and 
therefore no longer existing, but were not derecognized in the books 
or capitalized to an appropriate PPE account as of year-end.  These 
properties, which were located in various campuses of SSCT, were 
demolished to give space or being absolved as part of the newly

4.8.6 During audit and physical count of properties, the Audit Team 
discovered that a total of 212 PPE items consisting of furniture and 
fixtures, information and communication equipment, office 
equipment and books, were in custody of the College which were 
acquired allegedly through donation.  During verification, it was 
disclosed that the said properties were not recognized in the books.  
It was made known also that the two (2) items of furniture and 
fixtures located in Malimono campus were supported with donation 
papers but the same remained unrecorded.  The rest of the donated 
items were deficient of donation documents.  It was further revealed 
that, except for the two (2) furniture and fixtures in the Malimono 
campus and the books donated by the LGU Claver to SSCT Claver 
Extension Campus, the rest of the properties were not provided with 
corresponding costs and the date of donation as the same were not 
disclosed to the personnel in custody thereof through oral or any 
furnished supporting documents. The foregoing is summarized as

4.8.7 Review of the submitted RCPPE, it was observed that there were 

items with subject amount of P322,725.00 still recorded in the Main 
Campus even if the same were already transferred to other 
campuses.  Likewise, an item was also recorded as under the custody 
of a satellite campus but was found and counted in the main campus.  
These transfers were not supported with PTRs which showed the

movement and changed of accountability of AOs. Moreover, the 
corresponding covering PARs of these PPEs were also not updated 
to reflect the actual user or personnel having custody and control of 
the same, as shown below:

h) Absence of list/report of the buildings and estates prepared and 
maintained by the BEO 

 
4.8.8 During verification of the PPE accounts, it was learned that the BEO 

did not prepare and maintained a list or record of the estates of the 
School like the land and land improvements, as well as those 
completed infrastructure projects like buildings and other structures.  
As a unit in the institution which among its functions is to plan, 
oversee and monitor the construction and condition/status of the 
College’s estates and buildings, it is imperative that the office will 
prepare and maintain a list or record of completed fixed assets.  This 
report can be used in the effective formulation and discharge of 
decisions as regards the utilization of the assets vis-à-vis achieving 
the mandate of the school.  Also, the report can be utilized in 
reconciling the balances of the estates, buildings and other structures 
recorded in the books of the accounting and supply. 

 
4.9 When inquired on the foregoing-mentioned observations, the following 

were the comments of the concerned personnel: 
 
 
 
 



   
 

68 
 

• Unreconciled PPE balance between the Supply and Accounting 
offices 

 
4.9.1 The Supply Office explained that there was no reconciliation made 

for the PPE balances between the supply and accounting offices 
because the person in-charged for the account in each office had a 
hard time of meeting their schedules for the purpose.   

 
• Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) not supported with PAR 
 
4.9.2 The Supply Officer said that her office is on the process of updating 

all the PARs for the properties due to the recent reshuffling the 
school had instituted. 

 
• Items that were found and counted but were inconsistent with the 

RPCPPE 
 
4.9.3 The Supply Office said that they will recheck their records vis-à-vis 

the schedule prepared by COA on the matter.   
 
• Demolished properties that were not derecognized in the books 
 
4.9.4 The Accounting office reasoned that they had no documentary 

supports forwarded from the supply office or BEO as basis to do so.  
She added that this holds true with the donated properties as they 
were just waiting for the donation papers to be furnished to her 
office as support their action to record the same in the books.   

 
• Transfer of properties from one AO to another without the 

preparation of PTR 
 
4.9.5 The supply office admitted the deficiency as this was not practiced 

before. 
 

4.10 The Head of BEO was not available for comment on the non-preparation 
and maintenance of acquired, finished and completed estates, buildings and 
other structures. 

 
4.11 The foregoing practices were incongruent of Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445, 

Paragraph 30 of IPSAS No. 17, and Sections 3, 12, 13, 21 and 42, Chapter 
10 of GAM for NGS, Volume I which rendered the PPE account balance of 
P618,342,103.74 as of December 31, 2020 doubtful as to accuracy, 
existence and completeness. 

 
 
 
 



   
 

69 
 

4.12 We recommended that Management shall: 

 

• Instruct the Accounting and Supply offices to reconcile their PPE 
records.  This was mandated in Section 42 of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I; 

 

• Advise the Supply to update the PARs covering the issued PPEs and 
to do so every time properties are acquired and being used by any 

school personnel; 

 

• Direct the Supply Office to revisit and verify their records vis-à-vis 
the existing properties and the documents prepared as the result of 

the physical count conducted like the ones from COA.  Update the 

list for any unrecorded PPEs and reconcile the same with the 

accounting records.  Recheck the record for missing/lost PPEs.  

Ensure that the respective accountable officer shall be held 

answerable for the unaccounted properties; 

 

• Inform the Supply Office to prepare the Report of Loss, Stolen, 
Damaged or Destroyed Property to account the demolished PPEs, 

as well as the list of donated properties and the supporting 

documents thereof to the Accounting Office for 

recognition/derecognition of the same in the books.  The Supply 

Office shall also prepare the PTR for any movement of property 

from one AO to another and to update the corresponding PAR 

covering the item;  

 

• Instruct the BEO to prepare and maintain a list of the School’s 
acquired and completed estates, buildings and other structures for 

monitoring and reconciliation purposes; and 

 

• Request the VP for Administration to review and monitor the 
policies administered in the utilization and disposition of school 

properties as required in the College Code. 

 

 Management Comment(s) 
 

4.13 During the exit conference, the Management said that the audit 
recommendations are well taken and committed to comply thereof to rectify 
the deficiencies observed.  Likewise, in her letter-reply, the Accountant said 
that her office will wait for the reports from the Supply Office as their basis 
in the addition/dropping of PPEs from the books.

Doubtful and Misstated Balance of CIP-Buildings and Other Structures Account 
 
5. The reported year-end balance of the Construction in Progress (CIP) – 

Buildings and Other Structures account of P150,533,478.76 was misstated by 

P35,927,904.44 which corresponds to: (a) A completed Improvement & Repair 

of Poultry Building which was still included in the account and was not 

reclassified to the appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account 
amounting to P856,909.62; (b) Capitalizable betterments/enhancements costs 

incurred during the construction of SSCT’s infrastructures which were not 

directly recorded under the appropriate PPE account totaling P20,590,928.52; 

and (c) Two (2) On-going development projects which were misclassified 

under the CIP- Buildings and Other Structures account instead of the 

appropriate CIP account totaling P14,480,066.30, contrary to Sections 8, 23, 

24, 25 and 26, Chapter 10 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

NGAs, Volume 1 and the Revised Chart of Accounts of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume II.  Moreover, the Accounting Office did not prepare and maintain 

CIP-Ledger Cards in which the balance of the CIP – Buildings and Other 

Structures account did not reconcile with the records being kept by the BEO 

for the purpose showing a variance of P24,986,872.06 in violation of Section 

111 and 114 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 casting doubt on the accuracy, 

completeness and valuation thereof. 

 
5.1 Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provide that “The 

accounts of the agency shall be kept in such details as necessary to meet the 
needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 
information needed by the fiscal or control agencies of the government and 
the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of Accounts to safeguard against inaccurate and 
misleading information.”  Section 114 of the Decree says that “The 
government accounting system shall be on a double entry basis with a 
general ledger in which all financial transactions are recorded.  Subsidiary 
records shall be kept where necessary.” 

 
5.2 Section 8, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, which covers the 

different modes of acquiring PPE, provides that during the construction 
period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall 
be taken up in the books as CIP with the appropriate asset classification. As 
soon as the construction is completed, the CIP account shall be reclassified 
to the proper asset account.  Also, Section 23 thereof states, inter alia, that 
under the recognition principle in Section 3 of the same Chapter, an entity 
recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and 
equipment the subsequent costs incurred, like repairs, betterments, 
additions, etc. if the recognition criteria are met.  Section 24 of the same 
GAM likewise states that costs on major repairs shall be added to the 
carrying amount of the PPE and shall be depreciated over the remaining life 
thereof.  Section 25 of the GAM has more to say that betterments that 



   
 

71 
 

improve efficiency, reduce operating costs and extends useful life of the 
applicable capital asset category shall be capitalized.  Lastly, Section 26 of 
the Manual provides that additions that creates new unit and expansion or 
enlargement or extension of the old asset shall be both capitalized. 

 
5.3 Moreover, the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) provides the description 

of the following accounts, among others:  
 

Accounting Title  Construction in Progress-Buildings and 
Other Structures 

Account Number  10699030 
Normal Balance  Debit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

accumulated cost or other appropriate 
value of buildings and other structures 
which are still in the process of 
construction or development. Credit this 
account for reclassification to the 
appropriate Buildings and Other 
Structures account upon completion. 

 
Accounting Title  Construction in Progress-Land 

Improvements 
Account Number  10699010 
Normal Balance  Debit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

accumulated cost or other appropriate 
value of land improvements which are still 
in the process of construction or 
acquisition. Credit this account for 
reclassification to the appropriate Land 
Improvement account upon completion.   

 
Accounting Title  Construction in Progress-Infrastructure 

Assets 
Account Number  10699020 
Normal Balance  Debit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

accumulated cost or other appropriate 
value of infrastructure assets which are 
still in the process of construction or 
acquisition. Credit this account for 
reclassification to the appropriate 
Infrastructure Asset account upon 
completion. 
 



   
 

72 
 

5.4 Records showed that the CIP- Buildings and Other Structures account had 
a year-end balance of P150,533,478.76. The amount consists of 24 on-going 
constructions of various infrastructure projects of the School like 
construction or improvement of buildings, water and electrical facilities, 
room facilities, etc. (Annex E).  Audit however of the account disclosed the 
following: 

 
a) Completed constructed building that was not reclassified to 

appropriate PPE account 
 
5.4.1 It was observed during audit that the project Improvement & Repair 

of Poultry Building in SSCT Mainit Campus was already completed 
as of December 31, 2020 but remained recorded under the CIP- 
Buildings and Other Structures account.  The project involved the 
construction of a building that will house various poultry products 
of the School.  The construction thereof commenced on November 
19, 2018 with a cost of P856,909.62 and was completed on April 10, 
2019.  The same was inspected by the BEO personnel on April 15, 
2019 and consecutively issued a Certificate thereof that the structure 
was done in accordance with the approved plans, specifications and 
other requirements of the covering Contract. 

 
b) Capitalizable subsequent costs for infrastructure projects that 

were debited to CIP- Buildings and Other Structures instead of the 
appropriate PPE account 

 
5.4.2 The audit likewise disclosed that there were 12 ongoing and 

completed facilities of the School which underwent repairs and/or 
improvements with cost totaling P20,590,928.52.  Closer 
circumspection of these subsequent costs revealed that the activities 
evidently either increased the useful life of each of the properties, 
improved their efficiency, decreased corresponding operating costs, 
considered major repairs, betterments or additions to applicable 
capital asset. Therefore, the incurred cost thereof should be added to 
the carrying amount of the specific PPE as warranted by the 
definition provided in the GAM, and not to be debited to the CIP- 
Buildings and Other Structures account.  Moreso, nine (9) of the said 
projects were already completed as categorically mentioned by the 
Head of the BEO.  This gave more convincing reason that the same 
be classified to the specific PPE rather than be recorded under the 
construction in progress. The summary of the foregoing is provided 
in the attached Annex F. 

 
 
 
 
 



   
 

73 
 

c) Misclassified two (2) on-going projects under the CIP- Buildings 
and Other Structures account instead of the appropriate CIP 
account 
 

5.4.3 The examination conducted also discovered that the CIP- Buildings 
and Other Structures account included two (2) projects namely, the 
Perimeter fencing in Barangay Bonifacio and the Improvement of 
Water Facilities in SSCT Mainit Campus, at a cost to date of 
P159,395.90 and P14,320,670.40, respectively, or a total of 
P14,480,066.30. These projects should be derecognized from the 
said account and be classified instead to CIP-Land Improvements 
and CIP-Infrastructure Asset, respectively, following the account 
description provided in the Revised Chart of Accounts of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume II.  The details of the foregoing are as follows: 

  

No. Name of Project 

Date 

Started Location 

Total Cost 

Incurred to Date 

1 Perimeter Fencing 11/08/07 SSCT RDEX 159,395.90 
2 Improvement of 

Water Facilities 
02/07/20 SSCT Mainit 14,320,670.40 

Total   14,480,066.30 

 
d) Unreconciled balances of the Construction in Progress (CIP) – 

Buildings and Other Structures account between Accounting 
Office and BEO 

 
5.4.4 It likewise revealed during audit that the individual report/document 

of the CIP-Buildings and Other Structures balances prepared and 
maintained by the Accounting and BEO showed balances of 
P150,533,478.76 and P125,994,631.76, respectively, showing a 
variance of P24,986,872.06. The comparative analysis of balances 
is shown in Annex G.  In addition, schedules were prepared to show 
details regarding the Construction in Progress accounts and were 
maintained by the accounting unit instead of CIP-Ledger Cards. 
These schedules only supply information such as the name of the 
project, account code used and its corresponding accumulated 
amount which defeat the purpose of such document to provide 
relevant information regarding the asset constructed. 

 
5.5 During interview, the accounting staff explained that the certificates of 

acceptance/completion of completed projects were not promptly furnished 
by the BEO to the accounting, thus, it has been their practice to reclassify 
the foregoing to the appropriate asset account only upon full payment of the 
project cost. As regards the misclassification, the Accountant said that they 
have inadvertently recorded the two projects as CIP-Buildings and Other 
Structures believing that this is the proper account to be used for the asset 
constructed. With regard the non-reconciliation of the CIP-Buildings and 



   
 

74 
 

Other Structures balances between the Accounting and BEO, the accounting 
staff said it was due to the failure of the two offices to perform regular 
reconciliation and discussion regarding the status of the project 
implementation. She further said that because of the voluminous vouchers 
to be processed and other paper works, the CIP ledger cards were not 
maintained by the Office.  The Head of the BEO was not available for 
comment on the matter. 

 
5.6 The inclusion of completed project in the account, the recording therein the 

capitalizable subsequent cost instead of a direct recognition to the to the 
carrying amount of the specific PPE, and the misclassification of ongoing 
construction projects that should be recorded instead to other CIP accounts 
resulted to misstatement of a total amount of P35,927,904.44.  Meanwhile, 
the non-reconciliation of the CIP-Buildings and Other Structures balances 
between the Accounting and BEO, as well as the non-maintenance of CIP 
ledgers by the Accounting rendered the account doubtful as to accuracy, 
completeness and valuation. 

 
5.7 We recommended that Management shall: 

 

• Direct the BEO to promptly furnish the Accounting Office of all 
the records and information regarding the School’s completed 

constructed projects so that the latter will have basis, on a timely 

manner, the recording thereof in the books; 

 

• Instruct the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting entries 
to reclassify the completed infrastructure projects to their 

respective appropriate PPE account, as well as those capitalizable 

subsequent costs directly to the carrying amount of the specific 

PPE; 

 

• Advise the Accountant to reclassify the projects Construction of 
Perimeter Fence and Improvement of Water Facilities under the 

CIP-Buildings and Other Structures account to CIP-Land 

Improvements and CIP-Infrastructure Asset, respectively; and 

 

• Instruct the Accounting and Buildings and Estate Office to 
reconcile their records as required by law and the former to 

prepare and maintain ledgers for the CIP accounts.

Management Comment(s) 
 

5.8 In their letter-reply, the BEO and Accounting Offices were amenable with 
the audit recommendations and will comply the same to rectify the noted 
deficiencies.  The Accountant added that her office will wait for the report 
from the BEO regarding the completed projects to be adjusted in the books. 
Her office will likewise process the necessary adjustments in the books as 
regards the reclassification and misclassification of affected accounts. 

 
 

Misclassification of Other Payables Account 
 
6. Trust receipts under the Trust Fund of the College amounting to 

P105,111,177.33 were credited and misclassified to Other Payables Account 

instead of the following appropriate Payable accounts: (a) Due to NGAs – 

P61,890,280.15; (b) Due to LGU – P4,457,779.72; (c) Trust Liabilities – 

P38,436,476.07; and (d) Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable - P326,641.39 

resulting in overstatements/ understatements of the affected accounts, 

misstating the financial statements contrary to Section 112 of Presidential 

Decree (P.D.) No. 1445,  Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1, Section 7, Chapter 19 of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGS, Volume 1, and Chapter 3 

of GAM for NGS, Volume III. 
 

6.1 Section 112 of P.D. No. 1445 requires each government Agency to record 
its financial transactions and operation conformably with IPSAS and in 
accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 
6.2 Meanwhile, Paragraph 27 of IPSAS No. 1 and Section 7, Chapter 19 of the 

GAM, Volume 1, states that “Financial Statements shall present fairly the 
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out 
in IPSASs.” 

 
6.3 In accounting parlance, a misstatement is the difference between the 

required amount, classification, presentation, or disclosure of a financial 
line item and what is actually reported in order to achieve a fair presentation 
of the financial statement. 

 
6.4 Moreover, Chapter 3, Volume III of the same Manual provides the 

description of the following accounts: 
 
 
 



   
 

76 
 

Accounting Title  Other Payables 
Account Number  29999990 
Normal Balance  Credit 
Description   This account is used to recognize other 

liabilities not falling under any of the 
specific payable accounts. Debit this 
account for settlement of liabilities. 

 
Accounting Title  Due to NGAs 
Account Number  20201050 
Normal Balance  Credit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

receipt of funds for delivery of 
goods/services as authorized by law, 
fund transfers from NGAs, other than 
the BIR, for implementation of specific 
programs or projects and other inter-
agency transactions. Debit this account 
for delivery of goods/services, 
liquidation of funds received or 
settlement of liabilities or adjustments. 

 
Accounting Title  Due to LGU 
Account Number  20201070 
Normal Balance  Credit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

receipt of funds from LGUs for delivery 
of goods/services as authorized by law, 
fund transfers for the implementation of 
specific programs or projects and other 
inter-agency transactions. Debit this 
account for delivery of goods/services, 
liquidation of funds received or 
settlement of liabilities or adjustments. 
 

Accounting Title  Trust Liabilities 
Account Number  20401010 
Normal Balance  Credit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

receipt of amount held in trust for 
specific purpose. Debit this account for 
payment or settlement of liabilities. 
 

Accounting Title  Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable 
Account Number  10403020 
Normal Balance  Credit 



   
 

77 
 

Description   This account is used to recognize the 
incurrence of liability arising from the 
receipt of cash or cash equivalents to 
guaranty (a) that the winning bidder 
shall enter into contract with the 
procuring entity; and (b) performance 
by the contractor of the terms of the 
contract. Debit this account for refund 
after the fulfillment of the purpose of the 
bond or forfeiture upon failure to comply 
with the purpose of the bond.  
 

6.5 Records showed that the Other Payables Account in the financial statements 
indicated a balance of P133,993,468.74 as of year-end.  The account was 
composed mainly of receipts held in Trust.  These receipts were recorded in 
the books by debiting Cash-Collecting Officer account and credit to Other 
Payables, “Sub-Account Name”. 

 
6.6 However, it was disclosed during audit that out of the account balance of 

P133,993,468.74, total receipts amounting to P105,111,177.33 were 
misclassified to Other Payables Account instead of a credit to a specific or 
appropriate payable/liability account.  This misclassified balance consists 
of 105 separate and specific sub-accounts representing either a person, 
entity or specific transaction from whom the receipts were sourced, and is 
summarized below: 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
6.7 It was revealed further that the receipts from the NGAs were those coming 

from CHED, TESDA, DOLE, DOST, BFAR, DOST, NCIP, etc. purposely 
to implement a specific program and that was to grant financial assistance 
to financially-challenged students to support their cost of higher education 
expenses such as educational and cost of living allowance.  These financial 
aids were accompanied with agreements which carried, among others, an 
obligation by the School to liquidate the amount granted within a given 
period.  Thus, this should be correctly credited to Due to NGAs, instead of 
the Other Payables account, pursuant to the description provided in Chapter 
3 of GAM, Volume III.   

 
6.8 It was made known also that the receipts from the LGUs under the Skolaran 

and Satisfaction programs and other scholarship activities were granted for 

Source of Receipts  Amount 

National Government Agencies (NGAs) P     61,890,280.15

78 
 

the objective of providing financial relief to qualified students to continue 
their academic pursuits.  These financial grants were accompanied with 
agreements that the College will make a report to the LGU on the utilization 
of the funds.  This qualified the transactions to be recorded under the Due 
to LGUs account instead of the Other Payables account as provided in the 
account description. 

 
6.9 Furthermore, the funds received from persons or entities that were based on 

trust and confidence and which gave the College a commitment to 
accomplish the activities, programs and undertaking that accompanied the 
receipts should be correctly credited to Trust Liabilities. 

 
6.10 Lastly, performance/security bonds received on account of public bidding 

and space rental should be credited to Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable 
and not to Other Payables account based on the description provided in the 
GAM. 

 
6.11 During interview, the Accountant explained that it was already a practice 

by her office that all receipts under the Trust Fund shall be credited to Other 
Payables account. 

 
6.12     The foregoing practices were incongruent to Paragraph 27 of IPSAS No. 1, 

Section 7, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Chapter 3 of GAM 
for NGAs, Volume III misstating the financial statements by 
P105,111,177.33. 

 
6.13 We recommended that Management shall advise the Accountant to 

make adjusting entries in the books to reclassify the Other Payables 

account of P105,111,177.33 to appropriate liability accounts with the 

following proposed adjusting journal entry: 
 

Account Name Account Code Debit Credit 

Other Payables 29999990 105,111,177.33    
Due to NGAs 20201050      61,890,280.15

Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable 10403020            326,641.39  

To adjust entries made related to trust receipts under the Trust Fund of the College which 
were misclassified as Other Payables

Management Comment(s) 
 
6.14 In the exit conference, the Management said that they will comply the audit 

recommendation.  The Accountant likewise said in her letter-reply that they 
will make and prepare the necessary working papers and documents as basis 
for the adjustments to be made in the books and to process the restitution of 
the disallowances and charges to their respective or appropriate funds. 

 

 

Misclassification of Refund of Disallowance and Liquidated Damages 
 
7. The refund of disallowances/charges in audit and receipts of liquidated 

damages totaling P20,308,772.36 were misclassified to Other Payables 

Account instead of a credit to: (a) Receivable – Disallowances/Charges totaling 

P19,693,709.15; and (b) Income/Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in the amount 

of P615,063.21 resulting in overstatements/understatements of the affected 

accounts, thus misstating the financial statements contrary to Section 112 of 

Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, Paragraph 27 of the International Public 

Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1, Section 7, Chapter 19 of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume 1, and Chapter 3 

of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 

7.1 Section 112 of P.D. No. 1445 requires that each government Agency shall 
record its financial transactions and operation conformably with IPSAS and 
in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 
7.2 On the other hand, Paragraph 27 of IPSAS No. 1 and Section 7, Chapter 19 

of the GAM, Volume 1, states that “Financial Statements shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an 
entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out 
in IPSASs.” 

 
7.3 Moreover, Chapter 3 of GAM, Volume III, provides the description of the 

following accounts: 
  

Accounting Title  Receivables-Disallowances/Charges 
Account Number  10305010 
Normal Balance  Debit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

amount of disallowances/charges in 
audit due from public/private 
individual/entities which have become 
final and executory. Credit this account 



   
 

80 
 

for settlement of disallowances/ 
charges.  
 

Accounting Title  Miscellaneous Income 
Account Number  40609990 
Normal Balance  Credit 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

revenues and other receipts not 
elsewhere classified under any specific 
income account.  This account shall be 
closed to the Revenue and Expense 
Summary account. 
 

Accounting Title  Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 
Account Number  30101010 
Normal Balance  Credit (Debit) 
Description   This account is used to recognize the 

cumulative results of normal and 
continuous operations of an agency 
including prior period adjustments, 
effect of changes in accounting policy 
and other capital adjustments. This 
account is used to close the Revenue 
and Expense Summary account. 

 
7.4 Audit, however, disclosed that included in the year-end balance of the Other 

Payables Account was the refund of disallowances/charges in audit totaling 
P19,693,709.15.  These receipts were restitutions from the disallowances 
made by the Auditor on illegal disbursements of the Agency which have 
become final and executory like in the construction of projects and 
provisions of personnel benefits. These should be credited to the 
Receivable-Disallowances/Charges account instead of the Other Payable 
account, to close the former which was once debited when the receivable 
was recognized and set up in the books.   Moreover, the liquidated damages 
of P615,063.21 represents the amount paid by the suppliers/contractors as 
remuneration for failing to satisfactorily deliver to the College the agreed 
goods or services within the specified period of time. These should be 
closed to Income or Equity because the Agency had no obligation to pay 
the amount back to any person or entity pending any requirements to 
comply.  The details of the foregoing are summarized in the next page with 
the recommended credit account to be used in the reclassification.

7.5 During interview, the Accountant explained that it was her Office’ practice 

to deposit and record all the receipts from audit disallowances/charges in 
the trust fund.  She added that, since the restitution from the persons liable 
of the said disallowances/charges were on installment basis, the receipts 
therefrom were credited to the Other Payables account.  When collected in 
full, these payments will eventually be transferred and deposited to the 
appropriate fund where the same were originally disbursed and the liability 
account will be debited/closed.  To date, no transfer of restitution has yet 
been made from trust fund to other funds.  As regards the liquidated 
damages which was recorded as a liability, the accounting office admitted 
the deficiency and will make necessary adjustments in the books soon. 

 
7.6 The foregoing transactions/practices were incongruent to Section 112 of 

P.D. No. 1445, Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS No. 1, Section 7, Chapter 19 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, and Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III 
which overstated the Receivable - Disallowances/ Charges and Other 
Payables accounts and understated the Income/Equity accounts, misstating 
the financial statements. 

 
7.7 We recommended that Management shall instruct the Accountant to 

make adjusting entries in the books to reclassify the Other Payables 

Account to Receivable – Disallowances/Charges and Income/Equity 

Accounts in the amount of P19,693,709.15 and P615,063.21, 

respectively.  Restitutions from disallowances and/or charges shall be 

deposited and recorded directly to the specific fund where the 

illegal/irregular disbursements were originally made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 



   
 

82 
 

Management Comments 
 
7.8 In the exit conference, the Management said that they will comply the audit 

recommendation.  The Accountant likewise said in her letter-reply that they 
will make and prepare the necessary working papers and documents as basis 
for the adjustments to be made in the books and to process the restitution of 
the disallowances and charges to their respective or appropriate fund 

 
 
Non-amortization of Intangible Assets 
 
8. The reported balance of Intangible Assets amounting to P11,499,224.18 was 

misstated due to failure of the Management to amortize the same in the books. 

Moreover, the prescribed disclosures of the Assets were not presented in the 

Notes to Financial Statements for the period covered, precluding the users of 

the FS to obtain other relevant information thereof. The foregoing deficiencies 

violate the provisions in Paragraph 96 of International Philippine Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 31 and Sections 8 and 16, Chapter 12 of 

the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

8.1 Paragraph 96 of IPSAS No. 31 provides that “The depreciable amount of 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life shall be allocated on a systematic 
basis over its useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is 
available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for 
it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.” 

 
8.2 Likewise, Section 8, Chapter 12 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that 

“After the initial recognition of intangible assets, the foregoing should be 
carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment loss.” 

 
8.3 On the other hand, prescribed disclosures for intangible assets were 

discussed in Section 16, Chapter 12 of the same Manual as follows: 

For each class of intangible asset, distinguishing between 
internally generated intangible assets and other intangible 
assets, an entity shall disclose the following: 

 
a. Whether the useful lives are indefinite or finite and, if 

finite, the useful lives or the amortization rates used; 
b.  The amortization method used, which is straight line 

method, for intangible assets with finite useful lives; 
c.  The gross carrying amount, any accumulated 

amortization and any accumulated impairment losses at 
the beginning and end of the period; 



   
 

83 
 

d.   The line item(s) of the statement of financial 
performance in which any amortization of intangible 
assets is included; 

e.  A reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning 
and end of the period showing: 

 
1.  Additions, indicating separately those from those 

internal development, those acquired separately; 
2.  Assets classified as held for sale or included in a 

disposal group classified as held for sale in 
accordance with the relevant international or 
national accounting standard dealing with non-
current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations and other disposals; 

3.  Impairment losses recognized in surplus or deficit 
during the period (if any); 

4.  Impairment losses reversed in surplus or deficit 
during the period (if any); 

5.  Any amortization recognized during the period; and 
6.  Other changes in the carrying amount during the 

period. 
 

8.4 The CY 2020 financial statements of the College showed a balance for 
Intangible Assets at P11,499,224.18 consisting of Patents and Computer 
Software amounting to P212,342.40 and P11,286,881.78, respectively. The 
Patents recognized in the books pertains to the acquisition cost of 
application to register multiple Utility Model for the College to have 
exclusive right throughout the Philippines to make, use or import the 
specification and claims therein for a term of seven years. The certification 
of registration was filed with and granted by the Intellectual Property Office 
of the Philippines. On the other hand, the Computer Software acquired by 
the College were intended mainly for the implementation of Electronic-
Library (E-Library) System, Software Licensing of the College of 
Engineering & Information Technology Computer Laboratory and 
Learning Resource Center, all to be used by the students. 

 
8.5 Conduct of audit, however, disclosed that the intangible assets acquired and 

controlled by the management since 2016 up to the present (2016-2020) had 
no corresponding amortization recognized. Moreover, the Notes to 
Financial Statements prepared and submitted by the Accounting Office 
contained insufficient information regarding the estimated useful life, 
amortization method used and carrying amount of the aforementioned 
assets, which are relevant disclosures as prescribed in the standards. 

 
8.6 When inquired on the matter, the Accountant explained that they were just 

waiting from the concerned offices, who directly manage and responsible 



   
 

84 
 

for these intangibles, to make reasonable assumptions and assessment of the 
useful life of these assets so the former can eventually compute and 
recognize the amortizations thereof. 

 
8.7 Non-amortization of intangible assets by the Accounting Office misstated 

the financial statements due to non-recognition in the books the related 
expense, overstating the asset and equity accounts. Likewise, failure to 
present the prescribed disclosures regarding the intangible asset prevented 
the users of the FS, including the public, from relevant information thereof. 

 
 8.8 We recommended that Management shall: 
 

• Instruct the Accounting, ITSO and ICT Offices to coordinate each 
other in obtaining reasonable and supportable assessment on the 

useful life of the intangible assets; and 

 

• Direct the Accountant to amortize the intangible assets based on the 
obtained useful life and provide the relevant disclosures thereof in 

the Notes to FS as prescribed in Section 16, Chapter 12 of GAM for 

NGAs. 

 Management Comment(s) 
 

8.9 In the exit conference and in her letter-reply, the Accountant said that they 
have already communicated to the ITSO and ICT Directors requesting 
information as regards the useful life of the intangible assets.  Until the time 
they will receive such data from the said offices that they will make the 
necessary adjusting entries in the books to properly recognize the 
amortization and come up with the correct balance of the intangible asset 
account. 

 
 
Construction of Private Structures inside SSCT Campus Premises Without Legal 
Ownership 
 

9. Residential building and office structure owned by private individuals were 

constructed within the Surigao State College and Technology (SSCT), 

Malimono Campus premise without legal ownership/authority or agreement 

with the College to construct, operate and/or dwell within the SSCT property 

contrary to Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Article 120 of 

the SSCT College Code, depriving the School to enjoy the use of its own 

property and exposing the same to risk of legal disputes in the future, hence, 

interest of the government property was not fully protected. 

 

 



   
 

85 
 

9.1 Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that it is the responsibility of the head 
of the government agency to faithfully adhere to the declared policy of the 
state that all resources of the government shall be managed, expensed or 
utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss 
or wastage, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness 
in the operations of the government.   

 
9.2 On the other hand, Article 120 of the SSCT College Code provides that the 

VP for Administration and Campus Director shall be responsible for the 
proper administration and control of the site development of the property 
within its jurisdiction. 

 
9.3 During campus visit by the Audit Team, it was observed that one office and 

three residential building owned by private individuals were constructed 
within the SSCT Malimono Campus premise. It was disclosed that the 
corresponding owner of the office and each residential building has no legal 
ownership over the estate occupied, nor has a standing authority or 
agreement with the College to construct, operate and/or dwell within the 
SSCT property.   

 
9.4 Further, verification and review of available information revealed the 

following: 
 

9.4.1 The Cooperative Office - The building was constructed and owned 
by the Malimono Sea Explorers’ Multi-Purpose Cooperative 
(MSEMPC), a cooperative created by and whose officers and 
members are the SSCT faculty and staff.  Its operations commenced 
in CY 2008 when Dr. Elizabeth G. Aleta, a cooperative member, 
and Mr. Feliciano Macarine, the cooperative president, were the 
campus director of the school and faculty, respectively; 

 
9.4.2 Mr. Pedro S. Senados Residence/Boarding House -                               

Mr. Pedro S. Senados started to occupy the lot since time 
immemorial.  He is the son of Ms. Fidela S. Senados who happened 
to be a close friend of Mr. Gaudencio Mantilla, the former owner of 
the land.  Due to existing special friendship between the two (2), Mr. 
Mantilla gave a portion of his real property to Ms. Senados who, in 
later time, donated the same to SSCT evidencing the donation 
documents being kept by the latter.  When Ms. Senados died, Pedro 
continued to reside in the land.  He is now challenging the legality 
of the donation alleging the non-compliance by the College to the 
conditions attached to the gratuitous transfer;  
 

9.4.3 Mr. Jerry Superlativo Residence - The portion of the land which Mr. 
Superlativo presently occupies is owned by the late Judge Ildefonso 
Mantilla, the son of Mr. Gaudencio Mantilla.  Information from an 



   
 

86 
 

SSCT personnel revealed that Judge Mantilla donated the land to the 
College.  The gratuitous transfer however was deficient of 
evidencing documents.  Nevertheless, it was affirmed by the 
children of the Judge. Mr. Superlativo began his occupancy in the 
school property in CY 2016 when he asked permission from Judge 
Ildefonso Mantilla to dwell therein.   The house started as a day care 
center but was abandoned when it was transferred to the downtown 
barangay.  The structure was transformed into a residential building 
where Mr. Superlativo presently lives; and 

 
9.4.4 Mr. Waldarico Dagasdas Residence - The land which is occupied by 

Mr. Dagasdas likewise belongs to Judge Ildefonso Mantilla.  This is 
the same land which the Judge allegedly donated to SSCT however 
absent of documentary proof of donation.  Mr. Dagasdas began its 
occupation in the property in CY 1992.  The same with     Mr. 
Superlativo, Mr. Dagasdas was allowed to live therein because of 
the permission given to him by Judge Ildefonso Mantilla.  It was not 
clear however as to the relationship existed between Judge Mantilla 
and Mr. Dagasdas.   

 
9.5 The photos of the above-mentioned structures/residences are shown in the 

attached Annex H. 
 
9.6 During interview, the former Campus Director of SSCT Malimono 

commented that it was only the case of Mr. Senados, who sometimes 
noticeably built a structure inside the campus, was brought to the attention 
of the college president because during his directorship, the School was not 
yet able to come up with a land map showing its boundaries.  

 
9.7 It was only in CY 2020 that the College hired and paid a technically-

equipped land surveyor where it produced a clear topographic and as-built 
plan of the SSCT Malimono Campus property.  When the Vice President 
for Administration was likewise inquired on the matter, she commented that 
the former Campus Director was not able to inform the top management 
with clear information about the problem.  She however assured that she 
will elevate the matter to the school board to send a letter to the former 
Campus Director requiring him to furnish them with complete information 
regarding the same.  Consequently, the information can substantiate and 
corroborate their letter-request that will be sent soon to the Office of the 
Solicitor General (OSG) seeking for opinion/assistance on the proper 
actions to be undertaken against the illegal settlers. 

 
9.8 The presence of privately-owned structures and or illegal settlers within the 

SSCT premises did not only deprive the College to enjoy the use of its 
resources but also exposing the same to risk of legal disputes in the future, 
hence, interest of the government property was not fully protected. 



   
 

87 
 

9.9 We recommended that Management shall take appropriate action by 

sending a letter to the concerned illegal settlers to formally inform them 

of the school’s ownership over the estate and to request from the latter 

documents as proof of ownership over the land they are occupying 

and/or agreement/authority from the School to construct, operate 

and/or dwell therein. Moreover, expedite the request for intervention 

from the OSG through a letter asking legal remedies to address the 

matter. 

 

Management Comment(s) 
 

9.10 The College President commented that the audit recommendations are well 
taken.  He added that, as regards the case of Mr. Senados, the School will 
re-file before the proper court the ownership of the land because the first 
action by the latter asserting ownership thereof was dismissed due to 
technicalities.  With regard to the MSEMPC building, he will talk to the 
cooperative president that the latter will claim the structure.  The former 
may still operate and use the building but must be covered with an 
agreement. 

 
 
Delayed Submission of Accounts 
 
10. The quarterly financial statements, monthly trial balance as well as the 

monthly bank reconciliation statements of the College were not submitted to 

the Office of the Auditor in a timely manner as required under Section 122 of 

P.D. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 19 and Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, 

Volume I, precluding the timely conduct of audit on the said accounts and 

errors, if any, could not be detected and corrected immediately. 

 

10.1 Section 122 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that “The 
Commission on Audit may require the agency heads, chief accountants, 
budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel 
officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit 
trial balances, physical inventory reports, and such other reports as may be 
necessary for the exercise of its function.”  

 
10.2 Meanwhile, Section 60, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides 
among others the deadlines on the submission of financial reports, to wit: 

 
Sec. 60. Deadline on Submission of Reports. All NGAs shall 
prepare and submit the following financial statements and 
schedules as follows, within the prescribed deadline:

10.3 In addition, Section 7, Chapter 21 of the same GAM provides that the Chief 

Accountant shall submit the BRS within 20 days after receipt of the monthly 
bank statement to the COA Auditor, Head of Agency and Bank. 

 
10.4 Monitoring on the submission of financial reports for CY 2020 disclosed 

that the quarterly financial statements and monthly trial balance were not 
submitted to the Office of the Auditor in a timely manner or a delay of an 
average of two (2) months. Likewise, the Report of Collections and 
Deposits and the Report of Checks Issued were submitted late on the 
average of two (2) to four (4) months.  Moreover, the monthly Bank 
Reconciliation Statements (BRS) and supporting documents were also not 
submitted to COA on time or a delay ranging from three (3) to eight (8) 
months. 

 
10.5 It was noted also that the Management did not prepare and submit to COA 

the FS for the fourth quarter and the TB for the month of December.  The 
same were incorporated in the annual financial statements which were 
furnished to the Auditor on February 11, 2021. The detailed schedule of the 
foregoing-mentioned observations is attached as Annex I. 

 
10.6 Interview with the Accountant disclosed that the delay in the preparation 

and submission of the financial documents to COA was due to the manual 
recording of all the financial transactions up to the preparation of the 
financial reports. This is the current accounting process being adopted by 
the accounting office.  As regards the BRS, the delay in the preparation and 
submission of the Statement was due to the late receipt from the depository 
bank the bank statements and all supporting documents at an average of 
three (3) to four (4) months. 

 
10.7 The delay in the submission of quarterly financial reports, monthly trial 

balance as well as the bank reconciliation statements to the Office of the 
Auditor was a departure from the foregoing rules and regulations, thus, 
review of the reports was delayed and errors in the financial statements and 
account balances, if any, could not be detected and corrected immediately. 



   
 

89 
 

Likewise, it defeated the purpose of providing timely and relevant 
information to the intended users of the reports in making decisions. 

 
10.8 We recommended that Management shall: 

 

• Require the Accountant to strictly comply with Section 122 of PD 
No. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 19 and Section 7, Chapter 21 of the 

GAM, Volume I, in the submission of the financial reports to the 

Commission to facilitate the timely audit of the account balances; 

 

• Adopt a very good, high-technology accounting system. An efficient 
accounting system is a vital aid/partner in achieving the vision of 

the College which is to be an innovative and technology-advanced 

learning institution in the locality. A reliable accounting system will 

greatly help the School in the real-time generation of financial 

reports specially at the present that it gears up for a university 

hood; and 

 

• Enroll the College’s depository accounts with the LBP’s We-Access 
Facility feature for the former to have real time access to its 

financial transactions with the bank.  The Management may 

likewise make a representation and request in writing to the bank 

to furnish the College the bank statements or snapshots of the 

transactions involving the latter’s depository accounts to facilitate 

the timely preparation of the BRS. 

 

 Management Comment(s) 
 

10.9 During the exit conference and in the letter-reply, the Accountant explained 
that the delay in the submission of the reports and accounts, in addition to 
the manual recording of voluminous recording of financial transactions, was 
likewise due to: (a) Few accounting personnel to handle accounting and 
reporting works; (b) Work from Home arrangement due to pandemic; (3) 
Non-render of overtime by the school personnel; (4) Recent institution of 
personnel reshuffling which led to major changes in the work assignments; 
and (5) Leave from work availed by some accounting personnel.  
Regardless, the Accountant said that her office will try their best to submit 
the accounts and reports of the College on schedule. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 
10.10 It was observed by the Auditor that the late submission of accounts and 

reports by the accounting office had been recurring for quite sometimes.  
This prompted the former to issue an observation to the latter as reminder 
of the prescribed period of submission purposely for timely audit.

Non-Compliance to Bidding/Procurement Process 
 
11. The procurement process of the project Improvement of Electrical Facilities 

of SSCT Mainit Campus with a contract cost of P14,461,327.08 was not 

properly and completely observed, contrary with pertinent sections of the 2016 

Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus 

transparency, competitiveness and accountability in the procurement of the 

project was not fully ensured. Likewise, the payment was not supported with 

complete documentation which deviates from Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445, 

thus manifesting weak internal controls in the disbursement process. 

 
11.1 Section 1 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) 

of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184 states that the 2016 Revised IRR is 
promulgated pursuant to Section 75 of R.A. No. 9184 for the purpose of 
prescribing the necessary rules and regulations for modernization, 
standardization, and regulation of the procurement activities of the 
Government of the Philippines.  

 
11.2 Moreover, COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires 

the submission of all contracts and each of the documents forming part 
thereof by reference or incorporation to the COA for review and evaluation 
process within five (5) days from execution thereof. The updated 
documentary requirements for public bidding are enumerated in COA 
Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.  These contract documents 
should likewise establish that transparency, competitiveness and 
accountability in government procurement set forth in the IRR of R.A. No. 
9184 are fully upheld. 

 
11.3 Likewise, Section 4(6) of the same Decree provides that claims against 

government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 
 
11.4 Records, however, showed that on September 30, 2020 the College had 

entered into a contract with Charlz Construction, as the lowest calculated 
and responsive bidder, to implement the project Improvement of Electrical 
Facilities, SSCT Mainit Campus with a contract cost of P14,461,327.08.  
Construction began on November 16, 2020 and had a completion rate of 48 
percent as of December 31, 2020 with a total cost incurred as of year-end 
of P4,971,252.01.  

 
11.5 Evaluation of the contract documents revealed that the procurement process 

of the said project was not properly and completely observed as several 
deficiencies were noted during the conduct of auditorial review, as follows: 

 
11.5.1 The BAC was not able to comply the mandatory posting of the 

Invitation to Bid, Supplemental Bid Bulletin, Notice of Award, and 
Notice to Proceed to the PhilGEPS portal, agency website, and 



   
 

91 
 

conspicuous places of the agency reserved for such purpose; 
 
11.5.2 The BAC Resolutions and/or Minutes on several procurement 

processes like the preliminary examination of bids, detailed 
evaluation of bids, etc. were not prepared; and  

 
11.5.3 Relevant dates on the receipt by the BAC of some of the documents 

submitted by the bidders were not indicated. 
 
11.6 Further examination disclosed that various documents that were integral in 

the auditorial review were not attached to the contract to support the 
procurement of the said infrastructure project. Likewise, it was noted that 
the Contract was executed on September 30, 2020 but the same and its 
supporting documents were submitted to COA for review on November 18, 
2020, or almost two (2) months from its perfection. 

 
11.7 The details of the foregoing observations are herein attached and marked as 

Annex J. 
 
11.8 During interview, the BAC Secretariat said that non-compliance to the 

requirements was inadvertently done. 
 
11.9 The inadequate documentation and ineffective internal control measures 

over the procurement process was not in accordance with the above-cited 
provisions thus, validity and propriety of the procurement process could not 
be ascertained and the general principles on government procurement where 
transparency, competitiveness and accountability were not fully upheld. 

 
11.10 We recommended that Management shall require the BAC, including 

the BAC Secretariat and the TWG to immediately submit the lacking 

documents and explain the presence of procurement deficiencies/ 

irregularities.  Likewise, ensure that all documents necessary to 

support the procurement are attached to the contract before the same 

is submitted to the Auditor’s Office for auditorial review; and observe 

strict adherence to the pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of 

R.A. No. 9184 to properly and completely observe the procurement 

process. 

 

 Management Comment(s) 
 

11.11 During the exit conference, the College President inquired how the project 
became deficient from necessary bidding documents where in fact it failed 
already three (3) time in public bidding due to technicalities.  Nevertheless, 
he commented that the audit recommendations are duly taken and requested 
the BAC Chairperson to submit to COA the lacking documents as well as 
the requested justification. 



   
 

92 
 

Small Value Purchases Without Alternative Mode of Procurement 
 

12. The small value purchases of goods by the College aggregating P1,859,914.29 
had not been done through alternative mode of procurement contrary to 

Sections 10 and 48 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) 

of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184 thus, the assurance that the goods were 

obtained at the most advantageous price for the government, and the 

competitiveness and transparency in government procurement were not fully 

upheld.   

 

12.1 Section 10 of the Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 states that “All 
procurement of the agency shall be done through competitive bidding or 
alternative methods of procurement when conditions allow.  Moreover, 
Section 48 of the same IRR provides the alternative modes of procurement 
that government agencies may avail subject to respective conditions to 
comply.” 

 
12.2 Audit of the CY 2020 procurement activities of SSCT showed that there 

were purchases of small value goods like meals, snacks, groceries, sacks of 
rice, bottled waters, etc. with subject amount ranging from P89.00 to 
P130,500.00, or a total amount of P1,859,914.29, had not been done through 
alternative mode of procurement as required in Sections 10 and 48 of the 
IRR of R.A. No. 9184.  These goods were obtained from the income-
generating projects (IGPs) of the College either for meals and snacks during 
school personnel meetings and various activities, sacks of rice for school 
outreach programs, grocery items for office use/supplies as well as for 
canteen, bakery and catering operations.  Moreover, verification with the 
attached documents, these purchases were supported only with Official 
Receipt, Activity Design, Purchase Request, Statement of Account/Billing 
Statement, Inspection and Acceptance Report and Attendance Sheet.  This 
only showed that the Management did not attempt to avail any alternative 
mode of procurement, when conditions allow, in procuring the said goods 
in compliance with the provisions of R.A. No. 9184.  The summary of the 
foregoing are as follows:  

 
No. Fund Transaction Amount 

1 MDS Procurement of meals and snacks, 
grocery items, sacks of rice, bottled 
water, bread and biscuits

12.3 During interview, the Accountant explained that she thought the foregoing 
transactions have legal basis pursuant to a GPPB issuance which allow non-
conduct of alternative mode of procurement if the purchases are made from 
its income-generating projects. However, the audit team could not find any 
GPPB resolutions/issuances pertaining to that matter. 

 
12.4 The foregoing transactions run counter Sections 10 and 48 of the IRR of 

R.A. No. 9184 which precluded the assurance that the goods purchased 
were at the most advantageous price for the School and the competitiveness 
and transparency in government procurement were fully upheld. 

 
12.5 We recommended that Management shall stop the purchase of small 

value goods without the alternative mode of procurement.  All 

purchases below the threshold set in Annex H of the IRR of R.A. No. 

9184 should be procured through alternative mode of procurement 

subject to the corresponding requirements provided. 

 

Management Comment(s) 
 
12.6 The Management commented that most of the goods procured without 

canvass were those from the IGP. This was because of the issuance from 
the GPPB where it allows procurement from IGP not subject to competitive 
bidding or alternative mode of procurement.  The College President 
however said that the practice will be stopped until they can produce and 
show to the Auditor such pronouncement from the GPPB. 

 
 

Procurements Through Reimbursement Basis 
 
13. Expenses incurred in the conduct of school meetings, trainings, seminars, 

orientations, evaluations, interviews, as well as those purchases of supplies for 

office use, CoViD-19 response, and IGP operations totaling P959,496.55 were 

paid on a reimbursement basis instead of making payments directly to the 

suppliers contrary to Section 10 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations 

(IRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184, Sections 91 and 93 of Presidential 

Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020, and Section 2 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002, thus: (a) the government was deprived from the collection 

of taxes that could have been withheld out of the payments; (b) the assurance 

that the goods were purchased at the most advantageous price for the 

government, and the competitiveness and transparency in government 

procurement were not upheld; and (c) the process may be abused and may 

lead to misappropriation of funds if continuously practiced.  Moreover, 

Sections 12.2 of R.A. No. 9184 was not complied when the Agency allowed the 

end users to serve the Price Quotation Forms (PQFs) to the prospective 

suppliers instead by the BAC personnel. 

 



   
 

94 
 

13.1 Section 10 of the IRR of R.A. No. 9184 states that all procurement of the 
agency shall be done through competitive bidding except as provided in 
Rule XVI of the IRR, in which the identified alternative modes of 
procurement are justified by the circumstances, as follow: 

 
1. Limited Source Bidding; 
2. Direct Contracting; 
3. Repeat Order; 
4. Shopping; and 
5. Negotiated Procurement. 

  
13.2 Moreover, Section 12.2 of the IRR of the same Act provides that the BAC 

shall be responsible for ensuring that the procuring entity abides by the 
standards set forth by the Procurement Act and its IRR. 

 
13.3 The GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020 allows the procuring entities to apply 

the rules on Negotiated Procurement (Emergency Case) during a state of 
calamity given the CoViD-19 pandemic. 

 
13.4 Meanwhile, Section 91 of P.D. No. 1445 states that payments to creditors 

shall be made only upon the specific approval of the head of the agency 
concerned or his duly authorized representative, or if there be no such 
officer, upon the approval of the department head endorsed upon the 
warrant or check or voucher effecting the payment.  Also, Section 93 of the 
Decree states that warrants chargeable to revenue or trust funds of the 
national government or checks drawn against the Treasury Checking 
Account for Agencies maintained with any government depository shall be 
made payable either directly to the creditor to whom the money is due or to 
a disbursing officer for official disbursement. 

 
13.5 Lastly, Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides, among others, that 

payments must generally be made by checks unless the circumstances 
warrant the difficulty, impracticability and impossibility to make such 
payment. 

 
13.6 The post audit conducted on the CY 2020 procurements of the school 

revealed that there were expenses incurred during the conduct of various 
school activities aggregating P959,496.55 that were done through 
reimbursement scheme instead of direct payments to suppliers as shown in 
the table below:

13.7 It was also noted that there were 30 reimbursements with subject amount of 

P248,282.76 were supported with Price Quotation Form (PQF), duly signed 
by either the BAC Chairperson or the BAC Secretariat, and were served to 
the prospective suppliers.  This might give an impression that the purchases 
passed through the alternative mode of procurement conducted by the BAC.  
However, it was learned through an interview with the Management and 
Audit Analyst that the issuance and attachment of PQF to the 
reimbursement had been done by the end user as this was required by the 
accounting office. 

  
13.8 When inquired on the matter, the Accountant explained that reimbursement 

of petty expenses happened because of the School’s conduct of unplanned 
and unforeseen activities. 

 
13.9 The foregoing transactions/practices were not in accordance with Section 

10 of R.A. No. 9184, Sections 91 and 93 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 
1445, GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020, and Section 2 of COA Circular No. 
97-002 which: (a) deprived the government from the collection of taxes that 
could have been withheld out of the payments made directly to the 



   
 

96 
 

suppliers; (b) barred the assurance that the goods were purchased at the most 
advantageous price for the government, and the competitiveness and 
transparency in government procurement were upheld; and (c) subjected the 
government funds to abuse and misappropriation if the process is 
continuously practiced.  Moreover, the conduct by the end user of the 
bidding process which must rest solely with the BAC, circumvented the 
intent of Section 12.2 of the IRR of R.A. No. 9184. 

 
13.10 We recommended that Management shall:  

 

• Procure all goods through public bidding or alternative mode or 
procurement when conditions allow.  Refrain from effecting 

payments on the purchases of goods and services being utilized for 

various school meetings, trainings, seminars, orientations, 

evaluations, interviews, as well as those used in operations and 

activities through reimbursement basis.  Carefully plan and 

estimate all the expenses to be incurred and include any 

contingencies as warranted; and 

 

• Advise the BAC to conduct all the bidding processes of the School’s 
procurements.  This responsibility rests solely with the BAC as 

stated in R.A. No. 9184. 
 

Management Comment(s) 
 

13.11 The Management commented that they will comply the audit 
recommendations.  He however added that there were some procurements 
for meals and snacks made through reimbursement and that were incurred 
during emergency or unplanned meetings in which there was no ample time 
to have the same canvassed from suppliers.  He requested that this be given 
consideration and be allowed to be incurred through reimbursement basis.   

 
 Auditor’s Rejoinder 
  

13.12 The Auditor emphasized that the provisions of R.A. No. 9184 must be 
adhered at all times; that the law must come first before complacency.  The 
College should likewise consider austerity in the utilization of government 
funds; that unnecessary incurrence of meals and snacks during meetings 
must be avoided.  If at times that reimbursement is the most advantageous 
method of procuring the same, the Management should submit its 
justification to warrant the transaction and to attach complete supporting 
documents thereof.

Irregular payment of CoViD-19 Hazard Pay  
 
14. The College paid CoViD-19 Hazard Pay totaling P269,250.00 to its Contract 

of Services (CoS) or Job Orders (JOs) workers that was charged against the 

Income Generating Project (IGP) Fund not in accordance with Item 5.1 of 

DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1.  Moreover, a total of P374,625.00 

CoViD-19 Hazard Pay was granted to the College personnel, including the CoS 

and JOs, who reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced 

Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the locality without permission or authority 

from the College President contrary to Item 4.3 of the same DBM Budget 

Circular rendering all the payments irregular.   

 

14.1 Item 5.1 of DBM BC No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 states: 
 
 5.1 For NGAs, including SUCs 
 

5.1.1 The amount required for personnel occupying 
regular, contractual or casual positions shall be 
charged against their available released Personnel 
Services (PS) allotments, while the amount required for 
COS or JO workers shall be charged against their 
available released Maintenance and Other Operating 
Expenses (MOOE) allotments, without need for prior 
authority from the DBM, provided that all authorized 
mandatory expenses shall have been paid first. 
5.1.2 Should an NGA or SUC have insufficient PS or 
MOOE allotments, as the case may be, to fully cover the 
COVID-19 Hazard Pay at the rate of P500/day per 
person, a lower but uniform rate may be granted for all 
qualified personnel.” 

 
14.2 Moreover, Item 4.0 of the same Budget Circular provides the guidelines and 

conditions on the grant of CoViD-19 hazard pay.  Among the conditions 
mentioned, as provided in Item 4.3 thereof, is that the personnel/workers 
have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices 
or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of 
agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community 
Quarantine (ECQ) measures in the area of such office or work station. 

 
14.3 Records showed that in CY 2020, the College paid its employees, including 

the CoS and JOs, a total of P4,151,323.25 as CoViD-19 Hazard Pay 
pursuant to DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 The 
amount was charged against the IGP-MOOE amounting to P269,250.00 and 
against the MDS – LDDAP totaling P3,882,073.25, or a total of 
P4,151,323.25.  The payments were made twice during the year; first, for 



   
 

98 
 

the payroll covering April 6-30, 2020, and second, for the period October 5 
– November 13, 2020. 

 
14.4 Audit of the foregoing payments disclosed that the CoViD-19 hazard pay 

granted to the JOs assigned in the IGPs such as the canteen, garments, 
bakery, in the total amount of P269,250.00 was all charged against the IGP-
MOOE (Annex K).  It was further disclosed that CoViD-19 hazard pay that 
was charged against the MDS-LDDAP totaling P374,625.00, was also paid 
to the SSCT employees, whether regular, casual, contractual, as well as 
those CoS and JOs, for the number of days they reported to work even 
without the document showing the authority from the College President. 
These worked days that were absent of authority covered the days that were 
beyond the specified period indicated in the Approved Work Schedule 
(AWS) but were still counted, considered and correspondingly paid by the 
school.  The worked days without authority covered also those days that 
were inconsistent with the schedule provided in the AWS.  Example, if an 
employee was required, per AWS, to report to office on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday or MWF, he/was still paid for Tuesday or Thursday, 
or Saturday that he reported to school to work.  The summary of the 
foregoing is presented in a schedule herein attached and marked Annex L. 

 
14.5 During interview, the Accountant said that there was a document approved 

by the College President, giving authority to the SSCT personnel to report 
to work covering the alleged unauthorized dates which the Management 
paid.  The document however remained unsubmitted to the Auditor to date. 

 
14.6 The above-mentioned CoViD-19 Hazard Pay disbursements totaling 

P643,875.00 were not in accordance with Items 4.3 and 5.1 of DBM BC 
No. 2020-1 rendering the same irregular. 

 
14.7 We recommended that Management shall submit to the Auditor the 

justification or legal basis for the payments of CoViD-19 Hazard Pay 

that were charged against the IGP-MOOE.  Likewise, the Management 

shall submit to COA the complete documents showing the authority 

from the College President of the SSCT personnel, including the CoS 

and JOs, to report for work during the implementation of ECQ in the 

locality, and which paid by the Management. 

    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



   
 

99 
 

 Management Comment(s) 
 

14.8 In the exit conference, the College President commented that the payments 
were only made in consideration of the risk their personnel will encounter 
in coming to school to work in light of the CoViD-19 pandemic.  He 
however inquired on what the Management will do to justify the 
transactions and the personnel, especially the CoS or job orders will not be 
required to restitute the amount considering their meager income.  
Nevertheless, the President requested the VP for Administration to prepare 
and submit the requirements being asked by the Auditor. 

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
15. The College did not optimally utilize its CY 2020 GAD Fund amounting to 

P195,956,380.00 as evidenced by: (a) Very low utilization rate of 7.81 percent 

or only P15,311,911.00 out of P195,956,380.00 annual budget; (b) Inclusion in 

the GAD budget and utilization two (2) programs or activities which did not 

have clear identified gender issues and concerns in the total amount of 

P6,500,000.00; and (c) Attribution in the GAD budget and utilization the 

School’s four (4) major programs or activities without administration or 

conduct of the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) 

assessment with subject amount of P13,268,845.20, contrary to Sections 2 and 

43 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9710 and Items 1.2 and 1.2.3.2 of PCW 

Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02, defeating the purpose for which the 

program was created.   

 

15.1 Section 2 of R.A. No. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta for 
Women declares and affirms among others the role of women in nation 
building and ensures the substantive equality of women and men.  It shall 
promotes promote empowerment of women and pursue equal opportunities 
for women and men and ensure equal access to resources and to 
development results and outcome.  To realize this, the State shall endeavor 
to develop plans, policies, programs, measures, and mechanisms to address 
discrimination and inequality in the economic, political, social, and cultural 
life of women and men.  Also, Section 43 thereof states that the government 
shall prioritize the allocation of all available resources to effectively fulfill 
its obligations specified in the Magna Carta and that the GAD budget shall 
also be utilized for the programs and activities to implement the same. 

 

15.2 Meanwhile, Item 1.2 of PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02 dated 
August 1, 2019 requires that in the preparation and submission of the FY 
2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), national government agencies and 
instrumentalities shall observe the identification of gender issues, concerns 
and GAD mandates, among others.  Moreover, Item 1.2.3.2 of the same 
PCW Memorandum Circular states that, in the GAD budget costing and 



   
 

100 
 

attribution, the agencies may attribute a portion or the whole budget of the 
agency’s major programs/projects to the GAD budget using the HGDG tool. 
The percentage score of the program/project in the HGDG assessment shall 
correspond to the percentage of the budget of the agency’s existing and 
proposed major program/project that may be attributed to the GAD budget, 
provided that programs/projects with HGDG score below 4.0 shall not be 
eligible for budget attribution.  

 

15.3 Records showed that in CY 2020, the College budgeted for GAD activities 
in the amount of P195,956,380.00 which represents 39.55 percent of its 
annual GAA appropriation of P495,479,000.00.  The GAD fund was 
intended to implement and defray expenses for 10 each client-focused and 
organization-focused programs and activities and four (4) attributed 
programs.  Total expenses incurred during the year amounted to 
P15,311,911.00 with a balance of P180,644,469.00.  Audit of the fund 
conducted disclosed the following: 

 
a) Low utilization rate for GAD fund 

 

15.3.1 It was revealed during examination that only an amount 
P15,311,911.00 out of the P195,958,380.00 annual budget was 
utilized to implement three (3), five (5) and one (1) client-focused, 
organization-focused and attributed GAD programs and activities, 
respectively, out of the total 25 of them.  This represents a very low 
utilization rate of 7.81percent.  This is contrary to Sections 2 and 43 
of R.A. No. 9710 for not ensuring that the allotted budget is 
optimally used for gender empowerment. The summary of GAD 
programs and activities implementation are shown in the attached 
Annex M. 

 
b) Inclusion in the GPB GAD programs and activities that did not 

have clear gender issue or concerns 
 
15.3.2 It was likewise disclosed during audit that the GFPS included in the 

GPB two (2) GAD programs and activities which did not have clear 
gender issues or concerns addressed, as follow:

15.3.3 The PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020, 

as the School justified and which provides guidelines on the 
adjustment and/or implementation of CY 2020 GAD Plan and 
Budget in view of CoViD-19 situation, states in Item 4.1 that all 
national government agencies and instrumentalities are enjoined to 
review and revise, as necessary, their CY 2020 GPB to implement 
measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the 
unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to the 
CoViD-19 situation. 

 
c) Non-conduct of HGDG assessment for Agency’s GAD attributed 

major programs or projects 
 
15.3.4 The audit of GAD fund also disclosed that four (4) major projects of 

the College with subject budgeted amount of P163,000,000.00 and 
expenditures totaling P6,768,845.20 were wholly attributed to the 
GPB without the conduct of HGDG assessment. Review of the 
submitted GPB, we found out that there were two (2) client-focused 
activities and four (4) under the “Attributed Program” portion of the 
GPB totaling P167,500,000.00 of which were not subjected to 
HGDG assessment. These should have been assessed using the said 
tool to determine the portion thereof which is GAD responsive and 
correspondingly charged against the fund.  The summary of the 
foregoing are as follow:

TOTAL 163,000,000.00 6,768,845.20 

 
15.4 During the interview, the GAD Coordinator explained that the principal 

reason for not implementing the GAD programs and activities was because 
of the CoViD-19 pandemic.  Since most of these activities require meetings, 
groupings and meet ups which were among the things discouraged to do 



   
 

102 
 

during the pandemic, the same were not pushed through.  Virtual conduct 
of the said activities was likewise not feasible for the reason that the 
participants did not have all access to internet connection.  As regards the 
inclusion of programs and activities that did not have clear gender issues 
and concerns addressed, the Coordinator said that such was made pursuant 
to PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 believing that these have legal 
basis under the said Circular.  She further said that, with regard the 
attributed projects to GPB, the said attribution had just been done with the 
advice from the Planning Office. 

 
15.5 Evidently, the foregoing practices run counter Sections 2 and 43 of R.A. 

No. 9710 and Items 1.2 and 1.2.3.2 of PCW Memorandum No. 2019-02, 
defeating the purpose for which the program was created.   

 

 15.6 We recommended that Management shall: 

 

• Advise the GFPS to optimally utilize the GAD budget to implement 
the programs and activities indicated in the GPB. This is mandated 

in Sections 2 and 43 of R.A. No. 9710; 

 

• Instruct the GFPS to only include in the GPB and its utilization the 
programs and activities that addressed clear and evident gender 

issues and concerns.  This is expressly required in R.A. No. 9710 and 

Items 1.2 of PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02.  The PCW 

Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 likewise reiterated the 

compliance to the requirement; and  

 

• Advise the GFPS to always use the HGDG assessment tool in 
attributing a portion or the whole budget of the agency’s major 

programs/projects to the GAD budget. 

 

 Management Comment(s) 
 

15.7 In their letter-reply, the Management reiterated their previously-given 
comments on the matter.  However, they have manifested willingness to 
comply the audit recommendation to resolve the observed deficiencies.

B. Value for Money Audit 
 

Various Projects Remained Unfinished  
 
16. Three infrastructure projects totaling P4,804,002.01 remained unfinished 

despite the expiration of contract period, contrary to the Contract and 

Agreement signed by and between the Surigao State College of Technology 

(SSCT) and the Contractor and Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 

1445, thus deprived the intended beneficiaries from immediate usage of the 

facilities and defeated the purpose of the fund where the projects were 

appropriated.  Likewise, the Management failed to impose appropriate actions 

and remedies pursuant to Section III-A (2.c.i) of the Guidelines on Termination 

of Contracts and Section 4.2.g. of the Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting of 

Manufacturers, Suppliers, Distributors, Contractors and Consultant. 

 

16.1 Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that it is the responsibility of the head 
of the government agency to faithfully adhere to the declared policy of the 
state that all resources of the government shall be managed, expensed or 
utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss 
or wastage. 

 
16.2 Items 5.01 and 5.05 of the individual Contract covering the implementation 

of the projects Improvement of Automotive Technology Laboratory, 
Improvement of CIT Faculty Room, Electrical and Drafting Laboratories, 
both of SSCT Main Campus, Surigao City, Improvement and Repair of 
Swine Production Building (Phase I) and Improvement and Repair of 
Community Outreach Center Building, both of SSCT Mainit Campus, state: 

 
“5.01 The CONTRACTOR agrees and obligates itself to 
perform and complete all works provided for in this Contract 
within x x x Calendar Days (including Sundays and Holidays), 
reckoned after seven (7) calendar days from the date of receipt 
of the Notice to Proceed issued by SSCT. . .” 
 
X x x 
 
5.05 In case that the delay in the completion of the work exceed 
a time duration equivalent to 10% of the specified contract 
time plus any time extension duly granted to the Contractor, 
SSCT may rescind the contract, forfeit the Contractor’s 
performance security and take over the prosecution of the 
project or award the same to a qualified contractor through 
negotiated contract.” 

 
16.3 Likewise, Section III-A (2.c.i) of the Guidelines on Termination of 

Contracts states that a procuring entity shall terminate a contract for default 



   
 

104 
 

if the Contractor abandons the contract works, refuses or fails to comply 
with a valid instruction of the Procuring Entity or fails to proceed 
expeditiously and without delay despite a written notice by the latter. 

 

16.4 Further, Section 4.2.g of the Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting of 
Manufacturers, Suppliers, Distributors, Contractors and Consultant 
provides that willful or deliberate abandonment or non-performance of the 
project or contract by the contractor resulting to substantial breach thereof 
without lawful and/or just cause is one of the sanctions and grounds for 
blacklisting. 

 

16.5 During inspection of various property of the College, the Audit Team 
observed that there were three (3) infrastructure projects being implemented 
by the SSCT. Further verification revealed that these projects totaling 
P4,804,002.01 remained unfinished despite the expiration of the respective 
construction period with completion percentage ranging from 52 to 72 
percent.  The details of the foregoing are herein attached and marked Annex

16.6 Moreover, scrutiny of records pertaining to the above unfinished projects 

disclosed the following: 
 

a) Improvement of Automotive Technology Laboratory  
 
16.6.1 There was no additional work performed by the contractor after the 

latest payment made by the school to the former.  The site visit 
conducted by the Auditor showed that, vis-à-vis the Automotive 
Laboratory Floor Plan (Annex O), several of its facilities were either 



   
 

105 
 

not constructed, dismantled, mounted, and/or finished.  During 
interview, the former Head of BEO commented that the Contractor 
abandoned the project due to problems the latter encountered with 
its people.  As regards the remedial actions by the Management 
against the contractor’s abandonment, he said that the former had 
already instructed him to reconsider the project cost and to 
determine whether it is still beneficial to the school to implement 
the same “by Administration”. 

 
b) Improvement and Repair of Community Outreach Center (COC) 

Building 
 
16.6.2 Since the time of payment, the Contractor did not perform 

additional works for the project.   When inquired on the matter, the 
former Head of BEO commented that the Contractor never come 
back to complete the project when the latter’s request of just 
recycling the old materials to repair the ceiling of the building, 
instead of replacing it with new materials, was denied by the School.  
He said that the Management will just consider the adjustment if 
there would be a “Change Order” made thereto pursuant to the 
provision of R.A. No. 9184.  

 
c) Improvement and Repair of Swine Production Building (Phase I) 
 
16.6.3 There was no additional work done by the Contractor since the time 

they were paid by the School.  When asked on the matter, the former 
Head of BEO explained that the contractor for the swine building 
was the same company which was awarded with another project 
relative to the improvement/repair of the COC building.  He added 
that it was almost at the same time when the contractor abandoned 
the first contract with the College that the former likewise neglected 
to comply the second agreement with the latter. 

 
16.7 Evidently, the foregoing mentioned unfinished projects counter the 

provision of Items 5.01 and 5.05 of the respective covering Contract and 
Agreement and Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445, thus deprived the intended 
beneficiaries from immediate usage of the facilities and defeated the 
purpose of the fund where the projects were appropriated.  Moreover, 
failure of the Management to impose appropriate actions and remedies 
against unreasonable abandonment by the Contractors pursuant to Section 
III-A (2.c.i) of the Guidelines on Termination of Contracts and Section 
4.2.g of the Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting of Manufacturers, 
Suppliers, Distributors, Contractors and Consultant may result to loss 
and/or wastage of government resources. 

 
 
 



   
 

106 
 

 16.8 We recommended that Management shall: 
 

• Send a demand letter to the Contractor for the immediate 
completion of the project including the repairs/modification 

thereto, if needed, without incurring additional cost to SSCT; 

 

• Impose liquidated damages against the Contractors, if warranted, 
in accordance with Section 68 of the Revised Implementing Rules 

and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9184;  

 

• If justifiable under the circumstances, initiate termination of the 
Contract with the Contractor and issue Blacklisting Order against 

the latter.  Their posted performance security and money retention 

shall also be forfeited; and 

 

• Instruct the BEO to reassess and re-compute the cost of each project 
and to determine whether it is more beneficial to award the 

corresponding contract thereof to another contractor.  
 

Management Comment(s) 
 
16.9 In the exit conference, the College President said that the audit 

recommendations will be complied.  He added that a technical working 
group had already submitted to his office a report concerning the matter.  
The President likewise personally visited the projects and requested from 
the contractors some changes in the construction and for immediate 
completion.  The contractors however refused to respond and left the 
projects unfinished.  He also said that the Management will further evaluate 
the matter and probably will complete the projects “By Administration”, 
and at the same time will do necessary actions to semi-blocklist the 
contractors for having record of unfinished works and prohibit the same 
from participating in any College bidding. 

 
 

17. Two (2) infrastructure projects implemented through “By Administration” at 
a total cost of P4,000,000.00 remained partially completed as of year-end, 

despite the expiration of construction period, contrary to Section 2 of 

Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 depriving the intended beneficiaries from 

prompt availment of the full benefits expected therefrom.  Moreover, the 

Management failed to immediately perform corrective measures to utilize the 

available resources pursuant to Section 41.5 of the SSCT College Code so that 

further loss and/or wastage of the same could be avoided. 

 

17.1 Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that it is the responsibility of the head 
of the government agency to faithfully adhere to the declared policy of the 
state that all resources of the government shall be managed, expensed or 



   
 

107 
 

utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss 
or wastage.  Moreover, Section 41.5 of the SSCT College Code states that 
the Vice President for Administration conducts regular review of the 
policies on the administration and utilization of the College properties. 

 
17.2 Records showed that there were two (2) infrastructure projects that were 

implemented through “By Administration” in CY 2014 and 2016, 
individually, and which remained partially completed as of December 31, 
2020, details as follow: 

 

a) Construction of Roof Deck – Phase I (Engineering Building), 
SSCT Main Campus 

 
17.2.1 The project started on October 19, 2014 and which was expected for 

completion on February 19, 2015 or after 120 calendar days 
construction period.  It was among the funded capital outlay 
expenses under the STF in the budgeted amount of P3,500,000.00.  
Payments for labor and materials were made during the year and in 
CY 2015.  There were no noted financial transactions relating 
thereto that transpired since then.  Total cost incurred for the 
structure as of December 31, 2020 amounted to P3,045,400.75. 

 
17.2.2 During ocular inspection, the Audit Team did not notice any roof 

deck mounted in the area of the Engineering Building where it 
should be located except for the new cement finished that had been 
done therein, several foot bases for the posts and the unused meta 
plastic roofing being piled in an open area.  

 
17.2.3 During interview, the former Head of BEO explained that there was 

actually a portion of the roof deck that had been constructed before.  
All the required posts were made and set up and a part thereof were 
already covered with the purchased meta-plastic roofing.  Its 
implementation however stopped when a personnel from the City 
Government of Surigao noticed the construction and commented 
that the structure still need to be applied with a necessary permit.  
The former Head added that the roof deck was not completed 
immediately due to busy schedule and the implementation of 
several infrastructure projects that time, until it was damaged by the 
strong earthquake that hit the City in CY 2017.  The inspectorate 
team from Manila advised the Management to discontinue the 
construction posing risk to the users.  Further, the BEO Head 
mentioned that the School Management proposed that the remaining 
budget and unused materials of the project be distributed to the 
satellite campuses to be utilized for covered walk.   

 
 



   
 

108 
 

b) Provision of Canopy at 5-Storey Building, SSCT Main Campus. 
 

17.2.4 The project began its implementation on January 23, 2017 with 45 
calendar days construction period and was budgeted under the GAA 
MOOE in the amount of P500,000.00.  Expected completion of the 
structure was on March 9, 2017.  To date, the cost incurred thereto 
amounted only to P114,700.00 which was for the procurement of 
construction materials.  Accomplishment of the project was 
estimated by the former Head of BEO only at 32 percent until it was 
damaged by the massive earthquake that hit the City in February 
2017.  There was no additional financial transaction nor additional 
work had been to the project since then. 

 
17.2.5 During project inspection, the Audit Team noticed that the canopy 

had only been mounted to several windows of the offices located in 
the 5-storey engineering building.  The object had not been attached 
to areas of the building where the same should be fixed.  

 
17.2.6 When interviewed, the former Head of BEO commented that the 

project was one of the structures destroyed by the earthquake that 
hit Surigao in February 2017.  Being defective, the Management 
decided to suspend the project to this date. 

 
17.3 Clearly, projects that were not fully completed contravened Section 2 of 

P.D. No. 1445 depriving the intended beneficiaries from prompt availment 
of the full benefits expected therefrom causing wastage of government 
resources.  Moreover, failure of the College to immediately perform 
corrective measures to utilize the available resources from projects not 
completely materialized may further loss or damage the same. 

 
 17.4 We recommended that Management shall: 
 

• Ensure that all infrastructure projects are strictly monitored in 
accordance with plans and schedules of implementation, 

henceforth execute/implement the projects as planned; and 

 

• Immediately perform corrective measures to utilize the available 
resources of unfinished projects to avoid further loss and damage 

thereof.  Ensure that the utilization of the remaining budget and 

materials for other purpose must bear the approval of the Planning 

Office and the Board of Trustees.

 Management Comment(s) 
 

17.5 In the exit conference, the Management well-accepted the audit 
recommendations and will comply the same.  The College President said 
that the projects were stopped due to unsuitability to continue construction 
brought by the earthquake that hit the city.  They said that the College is 
still looking for a right and suitable use of the fund where to continue the 
construction of the projects. 

 
 
18. The project Construction of Three (3)-Storey Information Technology (IT) 

Building, Mainit Campus costing P1,500,000.00 remained unfinished despite 

the expiration of the revised completion date of April 21, 2016, contrary to 

Item 4 of the Contract and Agreement signed by and between the Surigao State 

College of Technology (SSCT) and Kent Marketing Group of Companies 

Incorporated, and Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 thus, 

deprived the intended beneficiaries from prompt availment of the benefits 

therefrom. Likewise, Management failed to impose appropriate actions and 

remedies pursuant to Section III-A (2.c.i) of the Guidelines on Termination of 

Contracts and Section 4.2.g. of the Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting of 

Manufacturers, Suppliers, Distributors, Contractors and Consultant. 

 

18.1 Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that it is the responsibility of the head 
of the government agency to faithfully adhere to the declared policy of the 
state that all resources of the government shall be managed, expensed or 
utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss 
or wastage. 

 

18.2 Moreover, Item 4 of the Contract and Agreement covering the construction 
of the three (3)-storey IT building in Mainit Campus and which was signed 
by and between the SSCT and Kent Marketing, the Contractor, states among 
others that the latter agrees to complete the project within 45 calendar days 
(CDs) from the effective date of the contract.   

 
18.3 Likewise, Section III-A (2.c.i) of the Guidelines on Termination of 

Contracts states that a procuring entity shall terminate a contract for default 
if the Contractor abandons the contract works, refuses or fails to comply 
with a valid instruction of the Procuring Entity or fails to proceed 
expeditiously and without delay despite a written notice by the latter. 

 

18.4 Further, Section 4.2.g of the Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting of 
Manufacturers, Suppliers, Distributors, Contractors and Consultant 
provides that willful or deliberate abandonment or non-performance of the 
project or contract by the contractor resulting to substantial breach thereof 
without lawful and/or just cause is one of the sanctions and grounds for 
blacklisting. 



   
 

110 
 

 
18.5 Records showed that in CY 2014, the Management planned to construct an 

IT building in the SSCT-Mainit Campus purposely for computer lectures 
and laboratories for teachers and students. The aforementioned project was 
included in the approved CY 2015 GAA in the amount of P1,500,000.00.  
Competitive bidding commenced during the year and it was awarded to 
Kent Marketing Group of Companies Incorporated, the lowest calculated 
and responsive bidder, at a cost of P1,349,571.52.  Construction of the IT 
Building commenced on January 4, 2016 with a contract duration of 45 CDs 
and the expected completion date was February 17, 2016.  On March 30, 
2016, the Contractor requested for an extension of the contract duration 
equivalent to 97 CDs temporary suspension and 21 CDs extension of works 
due to unfavorable weather condition, delayed delivery of construction 
materials and unpaid mobilization cost.  The approved revised expiry date 
of the contract was April 21, 2016.  First payment thereof was made in 
February 2017 amounting to P877,356.45 which corresponded to 94.56 
percent accomplishment by the contractor.  To date, there were no records 
on file showing additional works performed by the contractor, their eventual 
request for final billing, inspection report by the Agency of the work 
accomplished and the corresponding payment thereof.  In fact, per 
accounting records, security deposit was still unclaimed awaiting the 
completion of the project phase I.  

 
18.6 During one of the campus visits, the Audit Team observed that the project 

remained unfinished and still far from the intended finished structure, as 
shown in the building perspective.  This, regardless of the reported near-
100 percent accomplishment of the building, the payment by the College of 
almost its whole contract amount, and the lapsed of its construction period. 

 
18.7 Verification further revealed that the Management had not taken enough 

appropriate actions and remedies such as imposition of liquidated damages 
to the defaulting contractor as well as initiation to terminate the Contract 
and issuance of Blacklisting Order against the said Contractor. 

 

18.8 Interview with the former Head of the Buildings and Estates Office (BEO) 
disclosed that the amount actually proposed for the project was greater than 
P1,500,000.00, enough to cover the cost of the entire building, but only 
P1,500,000.00 was apportioned to the structure after the DBM trimmed 
down the proposed budget of all the infrastructure projects of SSCT.  The 
said amount was just utilized to start up the project which labeled the same 
as Phase I.  He added that the College had already contacted the contractor 
to claim the undisbursed contract cost subject to the submission by the latter 
of various documents.   

 
18.9 It is evident that the unfinished IT Building counters the provision of Item 

4 of the Contract and Agreement covering the implementation of the project 



   
 

111 
 

and Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 which deprived the intended beneficiaries 
from prompt availment of the benefits therefrom. 

 
 18.10 We recommended that Management shall: 
 

• Instruct the BEO to inspect and reassess the completion rate of the 
project; 

 

• If found deficient, demand from the Contractor the immediate 
completion of the structure including the repairs/modification 

thereto, if needed, without incurring additional cost to SSCT; 

 

• Impose liquidated damages against the Contractor if warranted in 
accordance with Section 68 of the Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9184; and 

 

• If justifiable under the circumstances, initiate termination of the 
Contract with Kent Marketing and issue Blacklisting Order against 

the latter.  The performance security of the Contractor shall also be 

forfeited. 

 

• Ensure to include in the proposed budget for DBM approval an 
amount intended to prioritize the construction of the IT Building 

until the same is completed.  The Management may likewise resort 

to identified savings from other capital outlay budgetary 

items/accounts which may be requested from the DBM to be used 

to continue finish the project. 

 

 Management Comments(s) 
 

18.11 The Management commented that the audit recommendations are well-
taken.  Presently, the College had already banned Kent Marketing from 
participating in any bid to be conducted by the former for the construction 
of its projects.  The institution is contemplating now to offer the contract to 
another contractor or complete the same through “By Administration”.  

 

 

Existence of Unnecessary Cubicles/Mini-Rooms in Classrooms 
 
19. Unnecessary cubicles/mini-rooms or structure were constructed/present in 

selected classrooms of the College not in accordance with Section 2 of 

Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Articles 41.5 and 114 of the College 

Code precluding SSCT to achieve full potential of their properties. 

 

19.1 Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that it is the responsibility of the head 
of the government agency to faithfully adhere to the declared policy of the 



   
 

112 
 

state that all resources of the government shall be managed, expensed or 
utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss 
or wastage, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness 
in the operations of government.  Meanwhile, Article 41.5 requires the Vice 
President for Administration to conduct regular review of the policies on 
the administration and utilization of the College properties.  Moreover, 
Article 114 of the College Code states that the Supply Officer shall ensure 
that university properties are utilized in accordance with law and 
regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage. 

 
19.2 The lack of classrooms is one of the problems that the College has been 

addressing for many years now.  In fact, it was observed by the Auditor that 
the institution had utilized even the remotest corner of the campus for 
schoolrooms, and the Management had always been massive in its program 
of constantly developing, renovating and improving its resources just to 
provide teaching space, among others, in consonance with the mission and 
vision of the College. 

 
19.3 During the conduct of physical count of school properties, the Audit Team 

observed that there were selected classrooms in the campus where 
unnecessary cubicles or structure exists, details as follow: 

 
19.3.1 Vocational/Automotive Building, Room No. COT 258.  The 

classroom is occupied by Dr. Lucihida M. Docoy as Instructor of 
Cosmetology course which was offered by the College years ago.  It 
was observed that a small room was constructed inside the 
classroom.  According to Dr. Docoy, the mini room was made 
several years ago to serve as a massage room for cosmetology class.  
It was noted however during inspection that the room was almost 
full of personal belongings like bed with foam, glass curtain, 
television, audio karaoke, fan and other personal ownerships.  
Presently, the classroom is utilized for social science subject classes 
since cosmetology had already been dropped as a course offered by 
the school.   

 
19.3.2 Engineering/Technology Building, Room No. COT 249.  The room 

is occupied by Mr. Rudy C. Docoy as Instructor of electrical 
engineering subjects and is being utilized as classroom/laboratory 
for the engineering courses.  It was noted also that a small room was 
made inside the classroom allegedly for a small office where a 
working table and office equipment were found.  The existence of 
the mini room was actually an extension of the floor area occupied 
for the classroom but its demolition may give additional space for 
the QAM office which settled immediately next to the classroom. 

 



   
 

113 
 

19.3.3 Engineering/Technology Building, Room No. COT 352.  The 
classroom is currently utilized by Dr. Rene A. Nala, an instructor for 
drafting subjects, part of architectural drafting course.  It was 
likewise observed that a small room was present inside the 
classroom which already existed when Dr. Nala assumed the room 
in CY 2007.    Presently, the room is being used as a storeroom for 
drafting materials and other documents even though a room for that 
purpose had already been provided in the autocad laboratory.   

 
19.3.4 Engineering/Technology Building, Room No. COT 252.  The 

classroom was used for electrical subjects and is currently occupied 
by Dr, Roland A. Sulima, an instructor for electrical course.  It was 
learned that the room was utilized before by the electronics 
department where a subject thereof required the installation of the 
lavatory.  As it is now occupied for holding electrical courses, the 
existence of the lavatory already inconsistent with its objective.   

 
19.4 During interview, the Supply Office explained that it has long been the 

objective of the Management to dismantle these unnecessary structures 
inside the classrooms to address scarce resources where to hold student 
classes.  She said that her office was just waiting for the final order from the 
President to do the activity. 

 
19.5 Holding unnecessary rooms and spaces inside the school classrooms run 

counter Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 and Article 114 of the College Code 
precluding the Institution to achieve full potential of their property. 

 
19.6 We recommended that Management shall dismantle or demolish the 

unnecessary rooms or structures inside the classroom to give the latter 

full space/area where to hold student classes and/or office.   

 

Management Comment(s) 
 
19.7 During the exit conference, the Management accepted the audit 

recommendations.  They will activate right away the school demolition 
team and will remove these cubicles/mini-rooms or structure to give ample 
space for instructional rooms.  The College President added that he will 
personally go with the team and personally visit these rooms and demolish 
those unnecessary cubicles, even those had not been seen by COA.

Sub-account Groceries – 
Main of the Accounts 
Receivable account, per 
Financial Statement is 
not reconciled with the 
aggregate amount of 
receivable per customer 
ledger account 
maintained by the 
Business Manager, 
which resulted in 
disparity of P515,500.19, 
in violation of Appendix 
6 of the Government 
Accounting Manual, 
Volume 1, casting doubt 
on the fair presentation of 
the account at year-end. 
 
Conduct reconciliation of 
receivable account on the 
records of the IRGO and 
accounting office, at least 
once every quarter.

The IGP Director prepared 
a working paper for 
reconciliation. Based on the 
report submitted 
P139,104.18 amount was 
still to be reconciled. 
 
The said unreconciled 
account is due to the fact 
that the grocery and bakery 
accounts were recorded as 
one IGP account while on 
the IGP books the same was 
recorded separately.  
 
The administration will 
take action on the said 
concern to avoid same 
issues regarding 
unreconciled accounts.

The Auditor has yet 
to receive updated 
report from the 
Agency that the 
variance had 
already been 
reconciled. 

The Administration’s 
failure to exert earnest 
efforts on the collection 
of lease receivable not 
only resulted to the 
accumulation of such 
account but also deprived 
it of additional funds for 
priority programs, 
projects and activities. 
 
Issue demand letter for 
these delinquent tenant 
accounts and pursue civil 
actions against them and 
consider the creation of a 
Collection Team to 
manage these collection-
related jobs; and 
implement the provisions 
stipulated in every lease 
contract relative to the 
undertaking of remedial 
actions in case of non-
payment.

Demand letters were 
already issued to the

the same concern was 
presented and that the OSG 
will issue demand letters to 
the delinquent tenants.

Due to the failure of 
management to institute 
sound monitoring and 
control system in the 
granting, utilization and 
liquidation of cash 
advance, the amount of 
P4,611,832.46 remained 
unliquidated as of year-
end, thus resulted not 
only in the accumulation 
of the Advances to 
Officers and Employees 
account, but likewise in 
the possibility of 
unaccounted loss of 
government funds.
