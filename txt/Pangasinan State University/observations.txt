Inquiry from the Campus Accountant concerned disclosed, that the receivables of ₱60,910.60 in PSU Bayambang Campus pertains to the disallowances of two faculty members for their failure to render service as stipulated in their agreement with the University.  



				The disallowances of ₱2,165,188.52 recorded in the books of PSU Lingayen Campus were supported with Notices of Finality of decision for disallowed transactions in 2012 and prior years.

				

				The disallowances of ₱260,258.13 recognized in PSU Sta. Maria Campus could not be verified by the Accountant, because there were no documents that were turned over by the predecessor.

		

				The disallowance of ₱115,705.24 in the books of PSU Urdaneta Campus pertains to the disallowed overpayment of benefits and reimbursements from CY 1994-1998 transactions.

				CHED MO No. 4, series of 2014 provides that Loans below ₱4,000.00 should be paid within five years, and loans above ₱4,001.00 within ten years from grant. While under CHED MO No. 25, series of 2008, loans granted under the SAFE Loan Program of ₱8,000.00 should be within two to five years after graduation, and that student-grantees should notify the school within 30 days from occurrence on any change of permanent address, status or married name.

		

				Interview with the Management revealed that due to lack of proper turnover of the different loan folders, these loans were not monitored and remained uncollected.

		

				The remaining balance of ₱2,460,101.59 of Other Receivables consists of the following:

		

		Campus

This observation is a reiteration of previous year’s audit findings that was communicated with Management, but not fully addressed. For CY 2020, Management was able to collect ₱432,837.01 or only 4.89% of the outstanding receivables of the prior year’s balance of ₱8,853,958.47, hence this reiteration. 



We recommended that Management take up following courses of action:

		

a)	Instruct the concerned Administrative Officers and Campus Accountants to strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 on the required analysis of dormant accounts by performing the conduct of regular and periodic verification, analysis and validation of the existence of the receivables and tracing of whereabouts/present conditions of the accountable officers concerned and continuously reconcile with the records of  Student Services Office  for  the immediate sending of demand letters and other viable options to collect such accounts; 



b)	Instruct the Student Services Office to comply strictly with the prescribed periods on the settlement of loans granted per CHED MO No. 4, series of 2014 and CHED MO No. 25, series of 2008;



c)	Coordinate with the Officer in Charge of Student Services Office to determine the current addresses and employment status of the student-grantees who already graduated, including tracing of records of the guarantors involved in the granting of loans and thereafter sending them demand letters in case the student’s whereabouts cannot be traced.  



d)	Direct all Campus Accountants to request for write-off of accounts which could no longer be collected after having exhausted efforts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005, and the applicable provisions of 2009 RRPC, supported with complete documentation.

		

In its comment, Management appealed to give them ample time to facilitate the collections. As an update, the Student Services established its alumni tracer activity to contact the identified student-grantees and their guarantors for the issuance of demand letters; the Administrative and Accounting offices were already instructed to perform all the available options to facilitate the settlement of disallowances, and, as to the collection of the service return monetary equivalent booked under Due From Officers and Employees account in the amount of ₱2,017,631.69, the matter is under court litigation.





Unrecognized Biological Assets



2)	The University did not recognize all its Biological Assets in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 27 – Agriculture and pertinent provisions of Chapter 11, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume 1, resulting in the understatement of Biological Assets account affecting the reliability of the account balance.  



Paragraph 13 of the IPSAS 27, Agriculture which provides the recognition criteria for biological assets, viz:



An entity shall recognize a biological asset or agricultural produce when and only when:



a)		The entity controls the asset as a result of past events;

b)			It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity…



Section 7, Chapter 11, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs provides that a biological asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell. 



As at December 31, 2020, the Biological Assets of the University were reported at ₱4,399,318.30 composed of the subsidiary accounts shown below:



		Accounts

		Infanta 

		(₱)

		Sta. Maria (₱)

		San Carlos (₱)

		4,399,318.30

			

Further audit showed the following conditions that undermine the accuracy and reliability of the reported balance of said assets as at December 31, 2020, to wit:



a)	The Bearer Biological Assets –Trees, Plants and Crops of Infanta Campus amounted to ₱1,700,000.00 only.  This amount is composed of Bonsai and Ornamental plants and 304 Mango trees which were previously valued by an employee expert in mango and bonsai with confirmation from DENR Staff.  However, all other various trees planted at the 2,000 hectare-forest land of Infanta Campus such as pomelo, kasuy, mangrove and other timber trees had not been inventoried and recognized in the books of the Campus resulting in the understatement of Biological Assets account affecting fairness of its presentation in the financial statements. 



b)	Post audit of disbursement vouchers and the related documents revealed that Binmaley Campus had maintained about 86,000 tilapia fry and fingerlings donated by BFAR- NFFTC for CY 2020. However, these were not recognized in the books as Consumable Biological Assets – Aquaculture at fair value. 



c)	Physical inspection conducted on the other Campuses such as San Carlos, Bayambang, Alaminos and Sta. Maria revealed that number of biological assets such as Mango, Papaya, Jackfruit, Calamansi, Guava and Dragon Fruit trees passed the criteria for recognition as Biological Assets.



The aforementioned observations and deficiencies resulted in the understatement of Biological Assets account affecting the reliability of the account balance. 



			We recommended that Management instruct the: 

	

a)		Property/Supply Officer to conduct complete inventory of all the biological assets of the University such as trees, plants, crops, livestock and aquaculture in coordination with all IGP Coordinators/ Biological Assets Caretakers, and

	

b)		University Accountant/ All Campus Accountants to make necessary recognition, corrections and adjustments on the Biological Assets account in coordination with the Property/Supply Officer through their updated reports, in accordance with IPSAS 27 – Agriculture and pertinent provisions of Chapter 11, Government Accounting Manual Volume 1.



		Management commented that the absence of standard guidelines in the valuation of biological assets created a lag in the Campuses’ recording of their biological assets. Nevertheless, they would seek expert assistance from the Department of Agriculture, and Department of Environment and Natural Resources for the proper valuation of all livestock, ornamental plants and fruit bearing trees that met the recognition criteria. Management committed to complete the recording before the end of CY 2021. 

	

	

	

	

	

	

Prescribed Forms and Reports of Biological Assets Not Maintained



3)	Biological Assets Property Card (BAPC) and Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) on trees, plants, crops and agricultural produce were not maintained by the University as prescribed under Appendices 78 and 79, respectively, of the GAM, Volume II, thus proper recording and reporting of said assets could hardly be determined/ascertained. 

 

Appendix 78 of the GAM, Volume II, prescribes the use of the BAPC to be kept by the Biological Asset/s Caretaker or Officer-in Charge for each class or type of biological asset to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, transfer, disposal and other information about the property that were received. 

		

	Relatively, Appendix 79 of GAM, Volume II, requires the preparation of (QRBA which reports on the balances at the beginning and the changes in fair values of the biological assets due to physical changes such as growth, degeneration, production and procreation. The QRBAs shall be submitted to the Accounting Office on a quarterly basis to record such changes in the books. 

	

	We requested copies of BAPC and QRBA maintained by the Biological Assets’ Caretakers/ Officer-in-Charge but only a List of Biological Assets by kind with the initial amounts for recognition were provided to the Audit Team which is not in accordance with the prescribed BAPC and QRBA as required by GAM.  

	

	Failure to maintain the BAPC and QRBA as prescribed under Appendices 78 and 79 of GAM, Volume II, respectively, stalled the proper recording of the biological assets and reporting of the changes in fair values of the biological assets due to physical changes such as growth, degeneration, production and procreation. 

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Biological Assets’ Caretakers of all Campuses, through the different IGP Coordinators concerned, to prepare and maintain BAPCs and QRBAs as prescribed under Appendices 78 and 79 of GAM, Volume II, thus, proper recording and reporting of the University’s biological assets would easily be determined/ascertained.





















Unreturned Inter-agency Transferred Funds– P3,363,989.54





4)	Inter-agency transferred funds which purposes of funding have been served and/or have become dormant amounting to ₱3,363,989.54 as of                 December 31, 2020 were not yet returned to Funding Agencies or reverted to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr)contrary to COA Circular No. 94-103 dated December 13, 1994 and Section 10 of the General Provisions (GP) of the (GAA), of Fiscal Year 2020, depriving the said government agencies of funds that could have been used for other beneficial undertaking. 

				

COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides the Rules and Regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing Agencies (IA). Item No. 6.7 emphasized that the implementing agency shall return to the source agency any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.

		

Further, Section 10 of the GP of the GAA, Fiscal Year 2020, provides that:



Sec. 10. Reversion, Closure, and Transfer Balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving Funds and Unauthorized Accounts. Departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; (iii) when they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established.



In case an agency fails or refuse to implement such closure, reversion and/or transfer, the Permanent Committee may recommend for approval of the President the closure, reversion and/or transfer of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving Funds and Unauthorized Accounts, as the case may be, on any applicable grounds, to wit:(i) in the cases above mentioned; (ii) when used in violation of the rules and regulations issued by the Permanent Committee, (iii) when they have remained dormant foran unreasonable length of time; or (iv) when needed by General Fund in times of emergency.





The account Due to NGAs showed a balance of ₱36,675,974.05as at December 31, 2020, of which ₱3,363,989.54 remained outstanding for more than three years and which purposes of funding have been served, detailed as follows:

			The Accounting Section disclosed that they cannot determine the length of existence of these balances forwarded from prior years in the books, and pertinent records to document the corresponding balances of such have not been produced. 

	

			The above-quoted provisions specifically require that the University return any unutilized amount to the Source Agency in order for the funds to be recognized as fully liquidated. The continued non-remittance of unused funds when the purposes thereof have already been attained, resulted in the unnecessary and prolonged recognition of liability of the said amount, hence, depriving the said funding agencies of funds that could have been used for other beneficial undertaking.

		

			Further, the University is required to revert the dormant fund including all the balances forwarded from prior years to the National Treasury to close the account, if warranted, in accordance with Section 10 of the GP of the GAA of Fiscal Year 2020.

	

			We recommended that Management instruct the University Accountant to:

	 

a)	Conduct a thorough review and analysis of all funds received by the University from various NGAs and initiate the immediate liquidation and return to SAs the unexpended balances/ unutilized amounts for all PPAs, and, thereafter, submit to the Audit Team the documents evidencing the return of funds; and



b)	Revert to the BTr all outstanding funds that remained dormant for unreasonable period of time in adherence to Section 10 of the GP of GAA 2020.

	

		Management replied that they are now in the process of completing the liquidation reports and eventual refunds of excess grants.  They committed to facilitate the full liquidation of remittances of excess grants of the above projects and update its status to the audit team in the earliest time possible.

	

	

	

B)	Compliance Audit





Untitled Land accounts





5)	The University failed to secure titles of 15 parcels of land under its Name which was not in consonance with Section 39 of PD No. 1445 and Section 449 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM) Volume I, thus, depriving the University full control of its rights to use and enjoy the property as absolute owner, thereof. 



Section 39 of PD No. 1445 provides that:



	In the case of deeds to property purchased by any government agency, the Commission shall require a certificate of title entered in favor of the government or other evidence satisfactory to it that the title is in the government. It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned, including those in non-government entities under audit, or affected in the audit of government and nongovernment entities, to comply promptly with these requirements.

					

Section 449 of the GAAM, Volume 1, states that: 

					

Land purchase by agencies of the Government shall be evidenced by a Torrens Title drawn in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, or such other documents satisfactory to the President of the Philippines that the title is vested in the Government. 

							 

			The following table shows the summary of the lands owned by the University subject of titling, to wit:

Based from the above table, it is deduced that 15 parcels of land with total lot area of 1,039.10 hectares were not covered by title registered in the name of the PSU which was not in compliance with Section 39 of PD No. 1445, and Section 449 of GAAM Volume I, thus depriving the University full control of its rights to use and enjoy the property as absolute owner thereof. 



Interview with the Management revealed that the titling of all lands owned by the University has been one of their priorities in the past years but due to difficulties in the retrieval and completion of documentary requirements needed by the regulatory bodies, the same were not fully materialized. 



Ownership of land and land rights are established on the bases of genuine title issued by the Land Registration Authority – Registry of Deeds, free from any liens/ encumbrances. 



We recommended that Management: 



a)	Designate a Task Force/Committee per Campus and an overall University Implementer to facilitate the immediate titling of parcels of land in its Name in consonance with Section 39 of PD No. 1445 and Section 449 of the GAAM Volume I, in order not to deprive the University full control of its rights to use and enjoy the property as absolute owner, thereof;  and



b)	Require the Committee per Campus to update the Audit Team on the Status of the titling process of the 15 lots mentioned above citing the reasons/issues that hindered the titling of the same. 



Management commented that sincerest efforts were made since 2015 concerning the titling of the aforementioned lots, however, due to some documentary concerns and constraints, not all lots were successfully titled. One of their major accomplishments is their completed Land Use Development and Infrastructure Plan (LUDIP) which helped them identify the issues that prevented the University to acquire a Torrens title on some areas of their campuses. A committee from each of the concerned campuses will be created to facilitate the legal requirements to formalize the University’s full ownership to the land in question. 



Inoperative Internal Audit Service Unit



6)	The University’s Internal Audit Service Unit (IASU) remained inoperative for CY 2020, contrary to Sections 2 and 3 of RA No. 3456 and Item 3.1 Chapter 1 of the 	Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM), thereby affecting the efficient and effective fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and functions.



Sections 2 and 3 of RA No. 3456, also known as Internal Auditing Act of 1962, as amended by RA No. 4177, states:

Sec. 2. There shall be created, organized and operated in all branches, subdivisions and instrumentalities of the government, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations to be known as agency for purposes of this Act, internal audit services which shall assist management to achieve an efficient and effective fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and functions.

	

	Sec. 3. The Internal Audit Service (IAS) shall be under the direct administrative supervision and control of the heads and/or assistant heads of the agency. It shall be organized as an independent staff unit and shall correspondingly perform staff functions. It shall be responsible for instituting and conducting a program of internal audit for the agency. The chief of the Internal Audit Service shall have the rank and salary equivalent to the third ranking official of the agency. He shall report directly to the head or assistant head of the agency.

	

Further, Item 3.1, Chapter 1 of the PGIAM expressly states the following:



[I]nternal audit is an integral part of the internal control system of public service organizations. The scope of internal audit is broad and involves all matters relating to operations and management control. 



Among others, internal audit encompasses the appraisal of the adequacy of internal controls, the conduct of management audit and the evaluation of the results of operations, focusing on the effectiveness of controls of operating systems and support services units/systems.



Review of the current organizational structure of PSU showed that an Internal Audit Services Unit (IASU) was instituted in August 2019 by virtue of Board Resolution No. 102 series of 2019 where a Focal Person was designated as the head. Internal Audit System Coordinators were designated per Campus and a Handbook on IAS was formulated, but the same is not finalized yet as of date.



 For CY 2020, the University included the IAS in the conduct of Baseline Assessment in the Quality Management System. Other than that, no other activities were conducted to make the IAS operative.  In an interview conducted with the designated IAS Focal Person, she informed the audit team that due to various priorities of the University that needs urgent action, she was required to complete the Manual on the LUDIP of the University, thus, causing disruption to her functions as IAS Focal Person.



The PGIAM categorically states that the IASU shall focus on the conduct of management controls and operations audit of the University’s functions, programs, projects and activities with its outputs and determine the degree of compliance with its mandate, policies, government regulations and systems and processes as a key tool to analyze and evaluate management deficiencies and assist top management by recommending realistic courses of action.  



Also, the PGIAM requires that an IASU has to undergo several formalities, and being a separate office with specific functions, it should be manned with personnel having specific eligibility depending on the current level of the University. The IASU, will after all, be tasked to assist management to achieve an efficient and effective fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and functions.



PSU currently maintains nine Campuses, with four types of funds (Fund 101, 161, 164 and 184) and separate sets of books. Additionally, the University also maintains special programs such as the PSU OUS and SAS among others. Despite the pandemic, the 2nd semester of CY 2019-2020 registered a total of 18,582 students were enrolled in the University. Moreover, PSU has also been active in attaining quality standard accreditations, within which its Internal Quality Audit conducted massive audit during the last quarter of CY 2020 for its PQA nomination.



Considering the bulk of transactions, clientele, projects, programs, and activities conducted by the University in its day-to-day operations, the need to strengthen its fiscal administration, risk management and monitoring through a fully functioning and well-established IASU would prove invaluable. 



We recommended that Management, while working for the full operationalization of an internal audit unit, instruct the IASU to:



	a)		 Focus on performing operations audit to determine the degree of compliance with mandate, policies, government regulations and accepted practices; and

	

	b)		Prioritize areas for evaluation, which may include systems and procedures maintained, organizational structures in place, asset management practices and internal control effectiveness and thereafter, assist top management by recommending realistic courses of action.



Management expressed their willingness to comply with RA No. 3456. In their reply letter, it was explained in detail that they have already designated an Internal Auditor as early as 2015, as well as the concurrence of the Board of Regents’ in its resolution in 2019.  However, due to budget restrictions of the National Government, the University cannot simply install an IASU.  The University has also strived to convince the DBM to provide a budget for additional plantilla positions, including a designated internal auditor, by incorporating in their proposal under the Revised Organizational Structure and Staffing Standards for SUCs (ROSSSS). 



In the meantime, the University is exerting to maintain an effective internal control system by designating a focal person, with the assistance of the Quality Audit office and the entire Finance Team of the University. 





Incorrect Assumption Dates

	

7)	The assumption dates of 84 PSU faculty members who were on official leave of absence, training or scholarship grant and whose ranks were subject of reclassification per National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 461 – Seventh Evaluation was not in accordance with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA) (Revised 2018), resulting in the overpayment of differentials and over-remittance of government shares with GSIS. 



Paragraphs 3 and 5 of Section 17, Rule VI, of the 2017 ORAOHRA Revised July 2018 reads:



Section 17. x x x 



If the appointee has taken his/her oath of office and assumed the duties of position, he/she shall be entitled to receive his/her salary at once without awaiting the approval/validation of his/her appointment by the Commission.  x x x”



xxx	



The appointment of officials or employees who are on official leave of absence, training or scholarship grant, shall be effective upon assumption or upon return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training.”



Moreover, Section 23 of the same Rule states:



The date of the actual assumption of duties of the appointees, as indicated in the Certification of Assumption to Duty (CS Form No. 4, Series of 2017), shall be the basis for the payment of his/her salary and determination of service rendered in the government.



Records showed that a total of 200 faculty members of PSU were granted salary and YEB differentials covering the period July 1, 2019 as a result of the reclassification/modification of their positions per (NBC No. 461 – Seventh Evaluation. Said reclassification/modification was covered under DBM Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) with Serial No. 0102019-11-044 dated November 29, 2019 stating therein that Organization, Staffing Position and/or Compensation Modifications were approved and effective not earlier than July 1, 2019.  Further, on the Clarification on the Effectivity Date of Appointments in State Universities and Colleges based on the Implementation of NBC No. 461, CSC Resolution No. 2000052 dated January 21, 2020 was issued which resolves that the actual date of issuance of appointments shall be indicated below the signature of the appointing officer/authority in the appointment form, but the effectivity of reclassification to faculty positions in the SUCs shall be on July 1, 2019 based on the implementation of NBC No. 461 pursuant to the Special Provision of the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund in RA No. 10924. 



Review showed, that of the 200 appointees, only 116 appointees were actually present on July 1, 2019, whereas, the other 84 appointees were either on study leave, leave of absence, official travel, maternity leave, sabbatical leave and had no entries in their DTRs/no submitted DTRs on file on July 1, 2019 as shown below:

However, it was reflected in their Oaths of Office and Certificates of Assumption to Duty that the taking of oaths of office and assumption to duties and acknowledgment of appointments were all undertaken on July 1, 2019 in the absence of a supporting evidence/document of their actual return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training as required under par. 2 of Section  17, Rule VI, 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), casting doubt on the authenticity and validity of the actual dates of assumption reported and non-determination of the overpaid salary and YEB differentials. 



The above deficiencies were inconsistent with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), resulting in the overpayment of salary and YEB differentials. As there was overpayment of salary differentials covering the period July 1, 2019, consequently, there was over-remittance of government’s shares in retirement and life insurance premiums with the GSIS. 





We recommended that Management:



a)	Instruct the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) to require faculty members who were on study leave, leave of absence, and on leave to rectify/correct the date of assumption of duties and taking of oaths of office reported based on the personnel’s actual date of assumption the soonest;



b)	Direct the Budget, Accounting and Cashier Services to make the appropriate adjustments and corrections on the findings and rectifications made by the HRMO, and submit supporting documents for such actions to the Audit Team, for review and evaluation, and



c)	Ensure that the dates of acknowledgment of appointment, assumption of duties and oaths of office reported by appointees were the actual dates such were undertaken and consistent with their entries in their DTRs to strictly adhere with Sections 17.1, 17.2 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018).



Management commented that the HRMO is to review all the DTRs submitted together with the Certificates of Assumption and identify those faculty members who are qualified to assume on July 1, 2019 and those faculty members who are not allowed to assume on July 1, 2019 as per ORAOHRA guidelinesand will make the necessary rectifications and salary differential refunds.The Budget Officer and the Campus Accountants were also instructed to review the submitted documents from the HRMO and deduct any excess payments as deemed necessary.
