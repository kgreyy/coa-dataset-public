1)	Other Receivables in the aggregate amount of ₱10,585,372.97 which have been outstanding for three years or more, remained uncollected, depriving the University of much needed funds for its operations especially in the grant of loans to qualified students under the Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) loan program.



We recommended that Management take up following courses of action:

		

a)	Instruct the concerned Administrative Officers and Campus Accountants to strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 on the required analysis of dormant accounts by performing the conduct of regular and periodic verification, analysis and validation of the existence of the receivables and tracing of whereabouts/present conditions of the accountable officers concerned and continuously reconcile with the records of  Student Services Office  for  the immediate sending of demand letters and other viable options to collect such accounts; 

b)	Instruct the Student Services Office to comply strictly with the prescribed periods on the settlement of loans granted per CHED Memorandum Order (MO) No. 4, series of 2014 and CHED MO No. 25, series of 2008;



c)	Coordinate with the Officer in Charge of Student Services Office to determine the current addresses and employment status of the student-grantees who already graduated, including tracing of records of the guarantors involved in the granting of loans and thereafter sending them demand letters in case the student’s whereabouts cannot be traced.  



d)	Direct all Campus Accountants to request for write-off of accounts which could no longer be collected after having exhausted efforts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005, and the applicable provisions of 2009 Revised Rules of Procedures of the Commission on Audit (RRPC), supported with complete documentation.



The above finding as well as other observations were discussed during the Exit Conference on February 23, 2021. The Management comments were incorporated in this Report, where appropriate.
