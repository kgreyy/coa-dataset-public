B)	Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements



We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the Agency.



C)			Significant Findings and Recommendations

	

1)	The existence, reliability, and accuracy of the Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) Account, with carrying value of P1,398,457,327.41 as at December 31, 2020, is doubtful due to the (a) continued inability of the Management to conduct physical count of PPE; (b) incomplete subsidiary records for the Construction in Progress (CIP) Account; (c) non-reclassification of completed projects undertaken by the University to their appropriate PPE accounts; and (d) unrecorded donation of lot from the City Government of Santiago contrary to Section 5 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 and Sections 8(g), 11, 13, and 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.



We recommended that Management:



a)	create an Inventory Committee, per Campus, to conduct a physical count of all University properties, and enable the reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Supply Offices, in compliance with COA Circular 2020-06 dated January 31, 2020; 



b)	require the Campus Accountants and University Bookkeeper of Fund 05 (Internally Generated Income) to maintain CIP Ledger Cards, reconcile, and adjust their records in order to reflect the accurate balance of CIP account in the books of the University; 



c)	reclassify the completed projects which are still recorded under the CIP account to their appropriate PPE account, as required under Section 8(g), Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and



d)	recognize the fair market value of the donated lot in the books of the University and the corresponding liability account by debiting Land and crediting Other Deferred Credits, as required under Sections 11 and 13, Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs Volume I.



2)	The reported balance of Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account as at December 31, 2020 amounting to P164,339,778.25 does not reflect the actual unliquidated balance of fund transfers from other NGAs due to errors in recording of financial transactions and failure of Project Teams to prepare and submit Financial or Liquidation Reports to Funding Agencies contrary to Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Annex M of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I. 



We recommended that Management require the Campus Accountants to regularly submit Financial or Liquidation Reports for submission to Funding Agencies and be the basis in debiting the Due to NGAs for fair presentation of the account balance, in compliance with the accounting procedure provided in Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and Annex M of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

	

3)	Unrecorded/unobligated expenditures of prior years were paid in Calendar Year 2020 resulting in overstatement of recorded expenses amounting to P10,392,190.38 and incurrence of unauthorized disbursements of P3,592,978.34 in violation of Sections 4 and 119 of PD 1445 and Section 2(a) of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.





We recommended that Management:



a)	require the implementing units to secure a certification of availability of allotment/budget and availability of funds from the Budget Officer and Campus Accountant, respectively, prior to the incurrence of expenditures; 



b)	require the Campus Accountants to record the corresponding asset/expense and liability accounts on all unpaid obligations at year-end, if any, and consistently observe the accrual basis of accounting as required under Section 119 of PD 1445 and Section 2(a) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 



c)	set cut-off date at year end to process claims for current year expenditures to be circularized to all officers and employees and not to accommodate late claims to avoid unlawful expenditure which is to be disallowed in audit; and



d)	refund the amount used in accommodating unauthorized expenditures totaling P3,592,978.34 to settle the issued Notices of Disallowance. 



4)	Special Trust Fund (STF) Fiduciary Fees amounting to P47,203,661.28, remained unutilized for Calendar Year 2020 out of the total budgeted amount of P80,838,096.71, thus, the paying students did not benefit from the school charges imposed on them by the University.  



We recommended that the University President:



a)	consider not to impose fees that are not needed or may not be utilized during the year to avoid accumulation of unutilized fiduciary fees every year and to lessen the financial burden of the unqualified students from free tuition fee; 

		

b)			require the Accountants to ensure that all transactions charged from the Student Development Fund be supported with approved SSC resolution; and 

			   

c)			ensure the implementation of approved programs and projects within the budget year in the most economical and efficient manner to provide better services and facilities to the students and eventually avoid the accumulation of continuing appropriations. 



5)	The payment of CBAO Incentives to ISU Cauayan and Cabagan officers and employees aggregating to P1,164,700.00 from 2018 to 2020 and P260,529.75 from 2019 to 2020, respectively, has no legal basis, thus considered as irregular expenditure of government funds. 



We recommended that Management require the refund of the CBAO incentives and stop the granting of unauthorized allowances to Campus officials and employees.



6)	Inadequacies in procurement planning contributed to the delays in the completion of 12 infrastructure projects with the aggregate contract amount of P127,357,997.02 and unnecessary time extensions were granted allowing Contractors to evade their liabilities for liquidated damages.



We recommended that Management:

a)	ensure that prior to any conduct of bidding or award of contract, procurement planning procedures, specifically detailed engineering activities such as preparation of design plans, technical specifications, quantity, cost estimates, and program of works, were already conducted in compliance with Section 17.6 of the IRR of RA 9184; 



b)	require the concerned officials to properly evaluate requests for time extensions so that only warranted time extensions are granted; and



c)	closely monitor the implementation of infrastructure projects and consider the imposition of legal remedies on contractors, if found negligent or at fault, in line with pertinent provisions of RA 9184.



D)	Status of total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges as at Year-End



As at December 31, 2020, the Isabela State University has unsettled suspensions and disallowances totaling P414,740.68 and P10,912,491.50, respectively. Disallowances amounting to P7,936,500.00 have become final and executory while disallowances aggregating to P2,819,886.00 are awaiting Notices of Finality of Decision (NFDs) to be issued by the Commission Proper. 



E)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



Out of twenty (20) prior year’s audit recommendations contained in CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, twelve (12) were fully implemented, five (5) were partially implemented and three (3) were unimplemented.
