 PART II - DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial and Compliance Audit



1.0 	The existence, reliability, and accuracy of the Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) Account, with carrying value of P1,398,457,327.41 as at December 31, 2020, is doubtful due to the (a) continued inability of the Management to conduct physical count of PPE; (b) incomplete subsidiary records for the Construction in Progress (CIP) Account; (c) non-reclassification of completed projects undertaken by the University to their appropriate PPE accounts; and (d) unrecorded donation of lot from the City Government of Santiago contrary to Section 5 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 and Sections 8(g), 11, 13, and 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.



	1)	Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that: “The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.”



	2)	Due to the existence of enormous amounts of discrepancies in PPE account balances of government agencies, the Commission on Audit issued COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 providing the Guidelines and Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE), Recognition of PPE Items Found at Station, and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items, for the One-Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies. Sections 5.1 to 5.3 thereof states:



“5.0 	GENERAL GUIDELINES



5.1	Each government agency shall conduct physical count of all its PPE, whether acquired through purchase or donation, including those constructed by administration and found at station.



5.2	The Head of Agency shall create an Inventory Committee composed of adequate number of members to be able to complete the physical inventory in three months or less. The Inventory Committee shall have at least one member each from the Accounting and Property Divisions/Units of the agency.



5.3 	The members of the Inventory Committee shall be temporarily relieved of all their regular duties to devote their full time in the conduct of the physical inventory taking until the same is completed. x x x.



5.8 	The Inventory Committee shall be responsible for the actual count to ascertain the existence, completeness, and condition of all PPEs owned by the government agency.”



	3)	The University’s Statement of Financial Position showed Property, Plant and Equipment at its carrying value of P1,398,457,327.41 as at December 31, 2020. It constitutes 73.59% of the total assets of the University. 



	4)	The Isabela State University relies the existence of its PPE on the printed copy of report generated from the Supply and Property Inventory System where they input the purchases and disposals during the year, without undertaking physical count to determine the actual existence and condition of these properties. 



	5)	Likewise, the Construction in Progress (CIP) account under Fund 05 (Internally Generated Income) has a GL balance of P37,755,034.89, however, upon verification, the ongoing construction for this Fund is only P14,847,127.57, which are as follows:

 P 14,847,127.57 

 

	6)	The discrepancy of P22,907,907.32 is the long outstanding balances from different Campuses, which they failed to determine the specific project it could be classified despite the effort made by the Accounting and Infrastructure Offices. This inadequacy could be attributed to the non-maintenance of the CIP Ledger Cards in the past by the Accounting Section of all Campuses concerned and lack of coordination with the Infrastructure Office.



	7)	Moreover, included in the CIP are two (2) projects amounting to P6,229,187.90 that were already completed but not timely reclassified contrary to Section 8(g), Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, requiring that as soon as the construction is completed, the CIP account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. These projects were completed prior to FY 2020:

Building for Nitrogen Gas Plant

TOTAL

	P 6,229,187.90



	8)	Non-reclassification of the above CIPs to the appropriate PPE accounts preclude the recognition of depreciation on these properties, overstating the carrying values presented in the financial statements.



	9)	Also, on March 5, 2018, the City Government of Santiago represented by its City Mayor, Engr. Joseph Salvador Tan, donated a 20,000 square meter lot to the Isabela State University. The validity of the donation is under the condition that ISU shall construct, within five (5) years, school buildings and other facilities for the operation of ISU Santiago Campus. Title of this lot was transferred to the University under TCT No. 165-2019002458. 



	10)	However, as at December 31, 2020, this transaction was not yet recorded in the books of the University. Section 11, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I requires that “PPE acquired through donation shall be recorded at fair value at the time of donation.” Section 13 also states: “Where a PPE is acquired through donation with conditions or restrictions, a liability account shall be recognized until the conditions or restrictions have been fulfilled.” 



	11)	As such, there is a need for the University to recognize the fair value of the land received as donation and the corresponding liability account in the books of the University. 



	12)	We recommended that Management:



a)	create an Inventory Committee, per Campus, to conduct a physical count of all University properties, and enable the reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Supply Offices, in compliance with COA Circular 2020-06 dated January 31, 2020; 



b)	require the Campus Accountants and University Bookkeeper of Fund 05 (Internally Generated Income) to maintain CIP Ledger Cards, reconcile, and adjust their records in order to reflect the accurate balance of CIP account in the books of the University; 



c)	reclassify the completed projects which are still recorded under the CIP account to their appropriate PPE account, as required under Section 8(g), Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and



d)	recognize the fair market value of the donated lot in the books of the University and the corresponding liability account by debiting Land and crediting Other Deferred Credits, as required under Sections 11 and 13, Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs Volume I.



	13)	The Management has already reclassified the two (2) completed projects namely: Renovation of Amphitheatre Campus and Building for Nitrogen Gas Plant, corresponding Journal Entry Vouchers Nos. 2021-01-0462 and 2021-01-04 were submitted to our Office.



	14)	ISU Echague Campus informed the Team that coordination with the LGU Santiago City Assessor’s Office is on-going to determine the fair market value of the land.



	15)	Memorandum from the Office of the VP - Administrative and Finance Services has also been issued to all Campuses as to the creation and composition of the Inventory Committee to enable the conduct of physical count on all PPE of the University. 



1)	The reported balance of Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account as at December 31, 2020 amounting to P164,339,778.25 does not reflect the actual unliquidated balance of fund transfers from other NGAs due to errors in recording of financial transactions and failure of Project Teams to prepare and submit Financial or Liquidation Reports to Funding Agencies contrary to Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Annex M of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I. 



1)	Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 providing the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies (IA) requires: “Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.”



2)	In support of the University’s vision to become a leading research University in the country and the ASEAN region, the University has consistently acquired funding from different NGAs for various research engagements. These funds received are presented under the Due to NGAs Account in the books of the University. 



3)	As at December 31, 2020, this account shows a balance of P164,339,778.25. It represents 64% of the Total Liabilities of the University. This account was used to record funds received from different NGAs intended for specific purposes, such for implementation of Special Projects and Scholarship Programs, hence, are considered Trust Receipts.



4)	Supposedly, the balance of the Due to NGAs account at any given date should present the unliquidated amount of funds received from the different NGAs. This account is credited when funds are received and debited upon submission of Financial/Liquidation Reports to the Funding Agencies as illustrated in Annex M of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



5)	However, analysis of the Due to NGAs, showed that debits to the account were directly made when funds are disbursed and not upon submission of Financial/Liquidation Reports. Hence, the balances presented under Due to NGAs represent unutilized balances rather than unliquidated balances. 



6)	It should be noted that ISU’s liabilities to the Funding Agencies for funds received were only settled upon submission of Financial/Liquidation Reports. The latest Financial Reports submitted to the Audit Team that was verified showed that the actual unliquidated balance of funds from other NGAs is amounting to P218,794,916.79. while SL showed a balance of P164,339,778.25, discrepancy of P54,455,138.54  as shown below:

7)	This discrepancy resulted from directly charging the Due to NGAs account for disbursements chargeable to special project funds which should not be the case. Debits to Due to NGAs should be made only upon submission of Liquidation Reports, in conformity with the illustration of Annex M of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



8)	Provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the implementation of Special Projects require the University to submit periodic reports of utilization of funds. However, as shown in Annex E, updated financial reports were not prepared and submitted for some special projects. Terminal reports were also not prepared and refunds of unutilized balances were not yet made for the following eight (8) completed projects:

9)	These lapses in recording and non-preparation of Financial/Liquidation Reports on a regular basis resulted in unreliable balance of the Due to NGAs at year-end. Non-submission of reports also causes delay in the release of succeeding funds from Funding Agencies, consequently, delay in the implementation of the projects. Aside from this, outstanding fund transfers to the University will accumulate in the books of funding agencies which is an indication of Management’s inability to comply with the provisions of the MOA. Because of these unliquidated fund transfers, ISU received, during the year, several letters from Auditors of various NGAs demanding liquidation of fund transfers which are already past their due dates. These circumstances can be avoided through regular preparation and submission of financial reports. 



10)	We recommended that Management require the Campus Accountants to regularly submit Financial or Liquidation Reports for submission to Funding Agencies and be the basis in debiting the Due to NGAs for fair presentation of the account balance, in compliance with the accounting procedure provided in Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and Annex M of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



11)	The VP for Administration and Finance Services issued Memorandum No. 41, s. 2021 directing concerned officials to comply with the recommendations.



12)	The University Accountant commented that they have started to prepare Liquidation Reports for Special Projects and furnished the concerned Project Leaders for submission to Funding Agencies in January 2020, This enabled them to closely monitor and reconcile budget registries with accounting ledgers monthly and serves as supporting documents to their debits to the Due to NGAs account.



13)	However, verification by the Audit Team showed that the Financial Reports being prepared were only for internal reporting and monitoring purposes and were not submitted by Project Leaders to Funding Agencies, thus, liabilities to the Funding Agencies were not settled.





1)	Unrecorded/unobligated expenditures of prior years were paid in Calendar Year 2020 resulting in overstatement of recorded expenses amounting to P10,392,190.38 and incurrence of unauthorized disbursements of P3,592,978.34 in violation of Sections 4 and 119 of PD 1445 and Section 2(a) of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.



1)	Section 4 of PD 1445 provides the fundamental principles governing financial transactions and operations of the government. Item 1 states that no money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority.



2)	Section 119 also states that, all lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.



3)	Moreover, Section 6(b), Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual Volume I requires each government entity to recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably with the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the PPSAS 1. 



4)	Accrual basis is defined under Section 2(a) as a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 



5)	The Isabela State University paid prior years’ expenditures of P13,110,065.58 in CY 2020. Of this amount, only P2,717,875.20 was recorded as Liability resulting in overstatement of recorded expenses amounting to P10,392,190.38.

6)	The Accrual Basis of Accounting as mentioned under PPSAS 1.2, requires expenditures to be recorded on the year these were incurred. This means that, for all unpaid obligations at year-end, the corresponding asset/expense and liability accounts should be recognized in the books of the University. This ensures that the financial statements reflect the actual amount of expenditures that the University incurred during the year. However, this requirement was not consistently observed in some ISU Campuses resulting in overstatement of current year’s expenses and disrupting the effective operation of the current year’s budgets.



7)	Moreover, audit of disbursement vouchers of the different Campuses revealed that prior year’s maintenance and other operating expenses amounting to P3,592,978.34 were charged against current year budgets, as shown below:

8)	Fund 01 refers to the allotments received by the University through the General Appropriations Act (GAA). Section 1 of the General Provision of RA 11465 otherwise known as the GAA for FY 2020 states:



“Section 1. Appropriation of Funds. The following sums, or so much thereof as may be necessary, are hereby appropriated out of any funds in the National Treasury of the Philippines, not otherwise appropriated, for the operation of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines from January one to December thirty-one, two thousand and twenty, except where otherwise specifically provided herein.” (emphasis supplied) 



9)	On the other hand, Fund 05 refers to the Internally Generated Income of the University or the income of arising from the collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, service and other income. RA 8292 or the Higher Modernization Act of 1997 empowers the Board of Regents (BOR) to appropriate such income to carry out the purposes and functions of the University. Section 24 of CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. 2011 providing the Policies and Guidelines for the Use of Income, Special Trust Fund and Program of Receipts and Expenditures of the State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) states that the Budget authorized by the BOR shall be implemented within the Calendar Year for which it was formulated. 



10)	Therefore, funds appropriated to the University under Funds 01 and 05 are intended only for University transactions and implementation of programs, projects and activities starting January 1, 2020. The practice of charging prior years’ expenses against the current year’s allotment/budgets is not allowed. If prior years’ expenses are accommodated, this only means that current year’s programs may have to be sacrificed. 



11)	This practice also implies that implementing units were allowed to incur expenses beyond their available budgets, which is a violation of one of the basic requirements for disbursements that availability of allotment/budget for obligation/utilization certified by the Budget Officer and availability of funds certified by the Accountant should be secured prior to the incurrence of obligations/expenditures and disbursement of funds. (Sections 36 & 37, Chapter 2, GAM for NGAs Volume I). This violation resulted in the incurrence of unauthorized disbursements aggregating to P3,592,978.34 for the year 2020.



12)	A related audit observation under AOM No. 2019-011 dated February 20, 2019 has been issued discussing the correct practice of fund utilization within the validity period of the appropriations, however, the improper utilization and charging of expenses still persists.



13)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the implementing units to secure a certification of availability of allotment/budget and availability of funds from the Budget Officer and Campus Accountant, respectively, prior to the incurrence of expenditures; 



b)	require the Campus Accountants to record the corresponding asset/expense and liability accounts on all unpaid obligations at year-end, if any, and consistently observe the accrual basis of accounting as required under Section 119 of PD 1445 and Section 2(a) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 



c)	set cut-off date at year end to process claims for current year expenditures to be circularized to all officers and employees and not to accommodate late claims to avoid unlawful expenditure which is to be disallowed in audit; and



d)	settle the amount used in accommodating unauthorized expenditures totaling P3,592,978.34 for settlement of the issued Notices of Disallowance. 



14)	The Campus Accountant of ISU Ilagan informed the Audit Team with the control measures that they are going to undertake in order to comply with the audit recommendations. 



15)	ISU San Mateo Campus committed to comply with the audit recommendations.



16)	ISU Roxas apologized for the lapses and informed the Audit Team that they have required the Procurement Office to furnish all records of unpaid purchases of prior years and tapped out staff to collate billing statements from suppliers. They have committed to get all these remedies done in order to fully comply with the recommendations.



17)	Further, the University Director for Finance explained that FY 2019 Special Budget was only approved by the Board of Regents on November 22, 2019, one month before the year-end. Thus, unutilized balances were forwarded the following year as continuing budget. Twenty six (26) transactions totaling P387,460.69 were charged against continuing appropriations. Nevertheless, she stated that the recommendations are well taken and assured that the Management will refrain from accommodating prior year’s claims. 

 

18)	The Audit Team disagrees with the statement of the Management that unutilized balances in the Budget for Fund 164 may be carried forward the following year as continuing appropriation and may be utilized for the payment of prior year expenditures. Section 24 of CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. 2011 clearly states that the Budget authorized by the BOR/T shall be implemented within the Calendar Year for which it was formulated. Thus, the Special Budget for 2019 to be implemented for Fiscal Year 2019, as stated under BOR Resolution No. 307, s. 2019, can only be utilized until December 31, 2019. 



19)	Also, Section 2.6 of COA Circular No. 2000-02 dated April 4, 2000 prescribing the Accounting Guidelines and Procedures on the Use of Income of SUCs pursuant to Republic Act No. 8292 states that any balance of allotments under Fund 164 at the end of the year shall be reverted to the Cumulative Results of Operations-Unappropriated (CROU). 



20)	In addition, Section 3 (w) of the above-mentioned CMO thereof states:



“Unexpended Amount - refers to the unobligated balance of the budget. At the end of a given period, the unexpended amount may be declared as savings. At the end of the calendar year, it may be considered as Surplus. This is usually the amount which is included in the cumulative results of operations unappropriated or the acronym popularly known as “CROU”, or simply stated, Accumulated Savings. The BOR/T, through the finance division may use the amount for the payment of additional incentives or reprogrammed as funding for projects proposed for the next calendar year (See Accumulated Savings). (emphasis supplied)” 



21)	Accumulated Savings, on the other hand, is defined under Section 3 (a) as the funds available for appropriation. It is computed as follows: 



Fund balance at the end of the year, then deduct the following:

1)	Projects still to be implemented and paid out of the general fund;

2)	Funds being accumulated for an Approved Project to be financed out of Student Trust Fund;

3)	Accounts payable properly booked or obligated in the books of accounts;

4)	Purchase Requests obligated in the current year but not yet liquidated within the year or delivery was made in the next calendar year; and

5)	Fund balances of self-liquidating entities (e.g. graduate school in some SUCs, and the like) auxiliary services and IGPs.

		

22)	The disposition of the Accumulated Savings or CROU shall be approved by the BOR/T upon the recommendation of the President in consultation with the ADCO (Section 31, CMO No. 20, s. 2011).  



23)	Moreover, Section 25 of CMO No. 20, s. 2011 states that expenditures which have been obligated in the current year but to be paid or settled in the next calendar year shall be funded out of remaining fund balance as of December 31. It shall be included as among those to be deducted from Fund Balance at the End of the Year in determining the Accumulated Savings subject of appropriation.



24)	From the above provisions, the Special Budget for Fund 164 is only valid for obligation on the year that it was formulated. Not all unutilized balances at year-end may be carried over to the following year and considered as continuing appropriations but only those funds allocated for projects still to be implemented, accounts payable properly booked or obligated, PRs obligated but not yet delivered and fund balances of self-liquidating units, auxiliary services and IGPs. Any other unobligated appropriations at year-end forms part of the Accumulated Savings of the University which may be reprogrammed as funding for programs/projects for the next calendar year with the recommendation of the President and approval of the BOR/T. Payment of prior year expenditures are also limited to those obligated in the prior year or booked up as accounts payable. However, the twenty six transactions aggregating to P387,460.69, were not obligated in the prior year or booked up as accounts payable. Hence, payments thereof were violations on the provisions of the CMO. 













1)	Special Trust Fund (STF) Fiduciary Fees amounting to P47,203,661.28, remained unutilized for Calendar Year 2020 out of the total budgeted amount of P80,838,096.71, thus the paying students did not benefit from the school charges imposed on them by the University.  



1)	CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20 Series of 2011 dated August 4, 2011 pertains to the Policies and Guidelines for the Use of Income, Special Trust Fund and Programs of Receipts and Expenditures of State Universities and Colleges.  Pertinent provisions of the said regulation follow:



2)	“Section 3 (V) Article I – STF refers to income of the SUC arising from the collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, service and other income.  This is broken down into:



a)	Tuition Fees for use by the SUC in carrying out its trifocal function: instruction, research and extension, and production, as well as defray its administrative costs (general administrative support);	

b)	Fiduciary Fund;

c)	Revenues collected by self-liquidating units; 

d)	Revenues generated by IGUs;

e)	Regular and other Trust Fund without separate depository account (NSTP, ROTC, NEDA or DOST Funding, or other NGA Funding for the implementation of projects through the State College.” 



3)	Section 3 (E) of the said CMO defines Fiduciary Fund as funds to which collection of fees intended for a specific purpose shall accrue.  This fund shall be used solely for the purpose for which it was authorized to be collected.  This includes athletic fee, cultural fee, computer fee, laboratory fee, shop fee, development fee, library fee and the like.  The listing of what is classified as fiduciary fund, as well as the college, office or unit accountable for its utilization shall be stated in the report of collections which is submitted to the BOR/T for approval.  Section 22 likewise provides that the budget for the use of income shall be submitted for approval to the BOR/T.



4)	As per charter of the University, the Board of Regents shall have the authority to appropriate and disburse its internal revenue subject to the usual existing accounting, budgeting and auditing rules and regulations. Income earned by each campus shall be withdrawn only after a supplemental budget has been approved by the Board of Regents; hence no money shall be spent/withdrawn from the depository account of the University without approved budget.



5)	Starting Academic Year (AY) 2018-2019, all Filipino undergraduates enrolled in SUCs and CHED-recognized LUCs, except for Filipinos who are already bachelor’s degree holders and undergraduates who are overstaying in their course and institution, will enjoy free tuition, miscellaneous, and other school fees pursuant to Republic Act No. 10931, known as the “Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017.” Students who are not eligible shall be charged tuition and other school fees as determined by the Governing Boards of the SUCs and LUCs. Fees collected as additional charges from students such as, among others, entrance fee, course audit, computer laboratory fee, alumni fee, RLE, SBO/SSC/SSCF, socio-cultural fees, graduation fee, and student development fees are considered fiduciary fees and are intended for the purpose for which these fees are collected for.



6)	However, analysis on the utilization of Fiduciary Fees for the Calendar Year (CY) 2020 revealed that 41.61% of the approved budget were only utilized during the current year leaving an unutilized amount of P47,203,661.28.

7)	Moreover, post audit of disbursement vouchers disclosed that some transactions related to 30% Student Development Fund was not supported by a SSC Resolution which is not in accordance with the University’s Implementing Rules and Regulations on the use of Student Development Fee as it states that “No amount from the SDF shall be used without recommending approval of the Supreme Student Council (SSC) Adviser and President and approval of the Campus Executive Officer.”



8)	Further analysis on the utilization of fiduciary fees for the last three years has shown that the income from the fiduciary fees were not fully utilized as programmed or programs/activities relating thereto were not implemented in the year the budget was formulated and approved by the BOR suggesting the needlessness for the continuity of collecting some of the said fees:

9)	The low utilization rate signifies the failure of the Management to ensure effective delivery of services to its students from the collected fiduciary fees, hence further resulting in accumulation of unutilized balances in Cash in Bank account of P226,661,145.64 with an increase of 62.41% from previous year balance of P139,561,520.87 under Fund 164 contrary to the provision under Section 24 of CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, which provides, “Implementation of the Budget – Budget authorized by the BOR shall be implemented within the Calendar Year for which it was formulated. The inclusive collection period and the Quarter for which the collection will be used shall be clearly and specifically stated.”



10)	Section 4 (d) of RA 8292 or the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997 provides that any income generated by the University or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees (BOR/T) for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college: Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.



11)	Although the some of the programs/projects/and activities were not effectively implemented which has been greatly affected by the pandemic, observing preventive measures for the spreading of Covid-19 disease, paragraph 5, Section 4(d) of RA 8292 provides that “if, for reason of control, the university or college, shall not be able to pursue any project for which funds have been appropriated and allocated under its approved program of expenditures, the BOR/T may authorize the use of said funds for any reasonable purpose for which, in its discretion, may be necessary and urgent for the attainment of the objectives and goals of the university or college.” 



12)	The mission of the University of upgrading the quality of life of its stakeholders by providing higher education opportunities through excellent instruction, research, extension, production services, innovations and the much-needed services and improved facilities, especially these times of pandemic, was not efficiently achieved due to low utilization of funds budgeted for the implementation of the programs and projects of the University. Absence of immediate action in the implementation of projects related to utilization of fiduciary funds resulted in idle and ineffective use of funds and may affect achievement of objectives of programs/projects intended for the educational needs of students and faculties.



13)	We recommended that the University President:



a)	consider not to impose fees that are not needed or may not be utilized during the year to avoid accumulation of unutilized fiduciary fees every year and to lessen the financial burden of the unqualified students from free tuition fee; 



b)	require the Accountants to ensure that all transactions charged from the student development fund be supported with approved  SSC resolution; and 

	   

c)	ensure the implementation of approved programs and projects within the budget year in the most economical and efficient manner to provide better services and facilities to the students and eventually avoid the accumulation of continuing appropriations. 



14)	The University Director of Finance Services commented that the low utilization rate was greatly affected by the restrictions caused by COVID-19, considering that there are no face to face classes starting March 17, 2020. Thus, physical school activities programmed for the year were not conducted and procurement of supplies, materials and equipment for instructional purposes was not feasible.



15)	ISU Jones, Cauayan and San Mateo Campus assured their compliance with the recommendations. ISU Cauayan also informed the Audit Team that a Memorandum was issued to the accountable office to have a catch up plan regarding the programs, project, and activities that were not effectively implemented in 2020 due to the Pandemic. 



16)	ISU Cabagan Campus commented that all transactions charged against the SDF are supported with SSC Resolutions.

1)	Campus Business Affairs Office (CBAO) Incentives aggregating to P1,164,700.00 and P260,529.75 were paid by the ISU Cauayan and Cabagan Campus, respectively, to its officials and employees from 2018 to 2020, as shown below:

2)	The payment of CBAO Incentives was anchored on Chapter 4 of the New Income Generating Enterprises (IGE) Manual of the Isabela State University provides the Incentive System of all IGE Activities and states that:



“The Net Profit of all IGE activities will be allocated following the 70-30 distribution where at least 60% will go back to the IGE 161 fund in order to strengthen or expand existing business and also to fund new ones.



The following shall be the distribution of net profit provided that only those businesses achieving at least 15% ROI shall be entitled for incentives (Table 2). Campus/College Administrative Support shall be based on contributions of administrative support staff as it is reported in the Free Services Inventories by the Enterprise Managers and verified by the CBAO Accountant. Incentives are based on proportionate contributions. It may include among others:



1)	The staff at the finance office who is specifically designated to handle the IGE account;

2)	The staff at the supply office specifically designated to handle all requests, purchases, deliveries, releases of supplies and equipment and maintain the stock books for the IGE activities;

3)	The staff specifically designated by the CBAO Director, the Division Managers, Enterprise Managers properly identified in their respective Free Service Inventories;

4)	Designated officials appearing in the foregoing incentive structure who are replaced for causes not attributable to them will be given incentive proportionate to the length of time they have served as such.

3)	Among the legal bases in the implementation of IGEs among SUCs, as stated in the University’s IGE Manual, is NBC No. 331 dated November 27, 1980 issued by the Department of Budget and Management to implement Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 872 dated June 8, 1979, on the participation of government schools in food production program, and prescribe the rules and procedures concerning the creation of school revolving fund out of income realized from agricultural projects embraced under said program. 



4)	Thus, provisions of the IGE Manual should be consistent with the aforementioned regulation. However, some provisions of NBC No. 331, as amended by NBC No. 331-A dated December 23, 1982, were disregarded. 



5)	Pertinent provisions of NBC No. 331 state:



“3.3 	Expenditures. No disbursement from the fund may be used to pay for honoraria, overtime pay, or other additional compensation to schools superintendents, district supervisors, or other officials/employees except as may be approved under Presidential Decree No. 985.



3.3.1	All expenses incurred in the food production program shall be charged to this fund by drawing directly against the account.



3.3.2	Expenses to be charged to the fund shall include cost of labor and supervision, honoraria, fertilizer, seeds, farm implements, and other costs directly associated with the program.



3.3.3	Net profits may be used to improve school facilities, acquire equipment, augment maintenance and other operating expenses, purchase library books, and other recurring expenses of the school, subject however to the requirements of LOI no. 29 limiting the purchase of motor vehicles, textbooks and supplementary/reference books, and the like.”



6)	Moreover, NBC No. 331-A, restating and amending NBC 331, states:



“4.4	Expenditures



		i)	All expenses incurred in the food production/manufacturing operations shall be paid directly from its bank account which shall include the cost of direct/indirect labor, supervision, honoraria for teachers/personnel involved in the food production efforts, fertilizer, seeds, farm implements and other costs directly/indirectly associated with the program.



		ii)	Teachers and students directly involved in the food production/manufacturing activities shall be given honoraria/wages at the rate of Php5.00/Php1.50 an hour, respectively, based on services actually rendered not exceeding 40 hours a month. The management staff shall likewise be given the same rate of honoraria as the teachers for the same number of hours of actual service. The allowable honoraria/wages shall be paid from the Revolving Fund and shall form part of the cost of sales.



		iii)	Honoraria shall be granted only to the school officials and employees who are on assignment to duly authorized and/or accredited agricultural and manufacturing operations.” 



7)	From the above provisions, payment of honoraria to staff members who actually take part in the food production program is allowed by the law but subject to certain guidelines and approval of the DBM. NBC No. 331-A likewise limits the services to be rendered by teachers and students directly involved in the food production/manufacturing activities to 40 hours a month. The honoraria shall be considered as expense chargeable to the IGE Fund to arrive at net profit. As provided under NBC no. 331, net profits may be used to improve school facilities, acquire equipment, augment maintenance and other operating expenses, purchase library books, and other recurring expenses of the school. It never mentioned payment of incentives from IGE Funds.



8)	ISU Cauayan and Cabagan Campuses paid incentives to the personnel allegedly involved in the IGE, contrary to NBC Nos. 331 and 331-A, which provide for payment to be in the form of honoraria and only to those who actually took part in the food production program.



9)	Perusal of the attachments to the disbursement vouchers showed that none of the IGE activities of ISU Cauayan and Cabagan Campuses are related to food production program. As such, income from these endeavours should not have been distributed as incentives but must form part of the University Revolving Fund of the IGE.



10)	Moreover, they have erred in the computation of the ROIs. Rationally, ROI is computed as the result of Net Income over Capital Investment. However, ISU Cauayan granted CBAO incentives based on the rate of Unutilized Collections over Total Collections which resembles unutilized collection ratio; while ISU Cabagan granted CBAO incentives based on the rate of Net Income over Total Revenue which corresponds to the net profit margin ratio.



11)	Furthermore, the manner of distribution of the incentives is also questionable. The incentive structure in the IGE Manual enumerates the recipients and their percentage shares. It also specifically states that incentives are to be based on the contributions of these employees. However, based on the payrolls, incentives were distributed to the employees under the Administration and Finance Services, some of them are not among those included in the incentive structure, and no documents were submitted proving their actual participation in the IGE activities. 



12)	From the foregoing, the Audit Team holds that the payment of CBAO Incentives is considered irregular and has no legal basis, thus, Notices of Disallowance were issued for this purpose.



13)	We recommended that Management require the refund of the CBAO incentives and stop the granting of unauthorized allowances to Campus officials and employees.



14)	ISU Cabagan stands that the grant of IGE Incentives is regular and legal, based on the provision of the ISU IGE Manual as approved by the ISU BOR in 2012, being empowered by RA 8292. The Management also prayed that the disbursement of IGE incentives be passed on audit and to recall our recommendations for the refund of the paid incentives.   



15)	However, this Team, being certain on this observation, issued Notices of Disallowance to persons liable, to be settled through refund of the amount received, or to be appealed by an aggrieved party within six (6) months by filing an Appeal Memorandum to the Regional Director in accordance with COA Circular 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009.















1)	The University was not reasonably compensated for the use of time and resources in undertaking collection function for various financing institutions/associations for obligations and contributions paid by employees through salary deductions depriving the government of income that could have been used for beneficial purposes. Moreover, unauthorized deductions were made on the monthly salaries of University employees causing monthly net take-home pays to fall below P5,000.00.



1)	Section 47 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act for the year 2020 provides:



“Sec. 47. Authorized Deductions. Deductions from salaries and other benefits accruing to any government employee, chargeable against the appropriations for Personnel Services, may be allowed for the payment of an individual employee’s contributions or obligations due to the following:



a)	The BIR, PhilHealth, GSIS and HDMF;

b)	Non-stock savings and loans associations and mutual benefit associations duly operating under existing laws and cooperatives which are managed by and/for the benefit of government employees;

c)	Associations or provident funds organized or managed by government employees for their benefit and welfare;

d)	GFIs authorized by law and accredited by appropriate government regulating bodies to engage in lending;

e)	Licensed insurance companies; and

f)	Thrift banks or rural banks accredited by the BSP.



Obligations due to the BIR, contributions due to the PhilHealth, GSIS and HDMF, and GSIS and HDMF loans shall be satisfied ahead of all other obligations. The remaining obligations due to other entities listed above shall be satisfied in the order in which they were incurred.



In no case shall the foregoing deductions reduce the employee’s net take home pay to an amount lower than Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00). (CONDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION – President’s Affirmation Message, January 6, 2020, Volume I-B, page 617, RA No. 11465)”



2)	The President’s Affirmation Message reads:



“As in previous years, it does not escape my attention that some government employees are entering into loan agreements with several financing institutions. While I recognize the advantage afforded to government employees in authorizing agencies to deduct the amount of their contributions and obligations to said financing institutions, the government should not be reduced to a mere collecting agent for these institutions. As such, I am placing under conditional implementation Items (b) to (f), Section 47, General Provisions, “Authorized Deductions,” Volume I-B, page 594, to task all government agencies to leverage the accommodation given to these financing institutions in order to secure the most favorable terms possible to uphold the rights and protect the interests of all public servants.”



3)	In addition to BIR, GSIS, PhilHealth and HDMF deductions, the University also deducted employees’ obligations and contributions for the following financing institutions/associations from their monthly salaries:

4)	Deductions for the ISU Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Landbank of the Philippines, China Bank Savings, ISU Consumer’s Cooperative, Solid Rock Cooperative, NASA and Faculty Associations are all classified under Items (b) to (f) of the above-mentioned GAA General Provisions on Authorized Deductions. However, prior to effecting these deductions from the monthly salaries of employees, it is only appropriate that express authority must first be obtained from them. Employees should expressly allow the financing institution or association to collect any obligation or contribution due from the employee, thru salary deduction, and enter into an agreement with the University to undertake the collection function on their behalf. 



5)	However, based on documents provided, agreements, evidenced by duly signed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), were only entered by the University with ISU Multi-Purpose Cooperative while some Campuses entered into separate agreements with China Bank Savings and Landbank of the Philippines. No MOA were provided for ISU Consumer’s Cooperative, Solid Rock Cooperative, NASA and Faculty Associations.  Hence, deductions for these financing institutions/associations should not have been accommodated by the Campuses. 



6)	Moreover, being the collecting agent for these financing institutions/associations and considering the use of the government time and resources, it is only right for the University to be compensated for services rendered thru the imposition of service charges.  



7)	Based on a document provided to the Audit Team, China Bank Savings pays 1% for the signatories and 1% for the institution, or a total of 2% of the total loan remittances made by the University. For the year 2020, a total of P42,288,420.59 was remitted. Hence, the University should have received a total of P845,768.41 as payment of service fees from China Bank for the year 2020 alone. However, Report of Collections during the year showed that only ISU Echague and Cabagan were able to collect service fees with reported total collections of P211,296.90 only, inclusive of service fees from prior year remittances. No Receivable account was set up for this. 



8)	On the other hand, based on the MOA, ISU Multi-Purpose Cooperative is only required to pay P1,500.00 per month, or a total of P18,000.00 annual service fee to the University. This amount is only equivalent to .06% of the total loan and savings remittances made during the year. 



9)	Also, no service fees were charged and collected on the other Financing Institutions/Associations, thus, the University was not compensated for the time and resources used in the processing of transactions and the government was deprived of the income that could have been used for other beneficial purposes. There was also no covering MOA or Authority to Deduct on these deductions.



10)	Further, University charges for IGE, Tuition Fees and Lost Asset were also collected thru salary deductions. However, in order to protect the interest of the employees, Campus Accountants must ensure that these are made with the employees’ express authority or consent.  Other deductions made such as death aid are voluntary social obligations, thus, should not be forced on employees thru salary deductions. As a result of these accommodations, there were employees who received net take home pays below P5,000.00, contrary to the above-mentioned GAA General Provision. 



11)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require Campus Officials to collect the 2% service fee from China Bank Savings from the time of the first loan remittance and issue the corresponding Official Receipts thereon;



b)	consider increasing the service fee being imposed on the ISU Multi-Purpose Cooperative to a reasonable percentage of the total loan/savings remittances to compensate the use of the University’s time and resources on the processing of transactions related to this financing institution; and



c)	stop the practice of deducting from employees’ monthly salaries their obligations and contributions to financing institutions/associations in the absence of their express authorities in order to protect their interests and avoid monthly net take-home pays falling below the P5,000.00 minimum.





1)	Inadequacies in procurement planning contributed to the delays in the completion of twelve (12) infrastructure projects with the aggregate contract amount of P127,357,997.02 and unnecessary time extensions were granted allowing Contractors to evade their liabilities for liquidated damages.



1)	Section 17.6 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 states that:

“No bidding and award of contract for Infrastructure Projects shall be made unless the detailed engineering investigations, surveys and designs, for the project have been sufficiently carried out and duly approved in accordance with the standards and specifications prescribed by the HoPE concerned or his duly authorized representatives, pursuant to the recommendation of the end-user or implementing unit and in accordance with the provisions of Annex “A” of this IRR. xxx”



2)	Item 8.1, Annex “E” providing the Contract Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects also states that: “Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.”



3)	Analysis of the Quarterly Reports on Government Projects/Programs/ Activities and its supporting documents submitted by concerned employees of the University showed that infrastructure projects have been incurring delays in their completion.



4)	One of the causes of these delays is the implementation of nationwide and local community quarantines due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing minimal movements among workers and difficulty in acquiring and transporting of materials. Also, observance of safety protocols among workplaces hampered the implementation of these projects which inevitably required additional contract time.



5)	However, other causes of delay, unassociated with the pandemic, such as variation orders and suspensions of work, were also observed, affecting the timely implementation of twelve (12) projects with aggregate contract cost of P127,357,997.02 (Annex H).



6)	The approved variation orders were caused by modifications in the plans to suit actual site conditions, to comply with end-user requirements, and to include additional items of work not included in previous plans, among others. Although these may be allowed, the frequency of occurrence indicate deficient procurement planning. End-user requirements should have already been presented and evaluated during the preparation of the project plans and specifications, and not during project implementation. Variation Orders may also entail budgetary problems, as one variation order required additional outlay of 20.93% of the original contract price, in excess of the 10% limit under Item 1.1, Annex E of the IRR of RA 9184.



7)	Another reason contributing to the delay in the completion of infrastructure projects is suspension of work. These were made for different reasons such as unfinished works in the preceding phase of the project being implemented, delay in provision/revision of plans, discrepancies in the provided plans, and the like.



8)	These reasons show Management’s inefficiency in ensuring their readiness in undertaking or implementing the projects. Pursuant to Section 17.6 of the IRR of RA 9184, it is required that all detailed engineering investigations, surveys and designs, for the project have been sufficiently carried out prior to the conduct of bidding and award of contract. This means that project drawings and plans should have been completed before the conduct of bidding. However, documents show that even after the issuance of Notices to Proceed, project plans and sites were still not ready, indicating blatant disregard of the requirements of the law, causing unnecessary delay in the completion of the projects. 



9)	Also, there were time extensions granted to the Contractors which were not properly evaluated. In two instances, the Contractors requested for additional time extension for the reason that additional works/change orders were required by the Management. However, analysis of the documents showed that these Contractors were already given additional days of work upon issuance of the variation orders. Moreover, we observed that time extensions were granted for unavailability of materials or manpower, which are not valid grounds for time extensions. (Item 10.2, Annex “E” of the IRR of RA 9184) These leniencies in transacting with Contractors allows them to evade their liabilities in paying for liquidated damages if these projects were not completed within the agreed contract durations. 



10)	These commissions and omissions significantly contributed to the delays in the completion of the projects. It is reminded that one of the responsibilities of the Agency is to ensure the timely implementation and completion of infrastructure projects. It is not normal for projects to always incur delays during implementation as this negatively impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of agency operations and deprives the intended beneficiaries of the beneficial use of the projects.



11)	We recommended that Management:



a)	ensure that prior to any conduct of bidding or award of contract, procurement planning procedures, specifically detailed engineering activities such as preparation of design plans, technical specifications, quantity, cost estimates, and program of works, were already conducted in compliance with Section 17.6 of the IRR of RA 9184; 



b)	require the concerned officials to properly evaluate requests for time extensions so that only warranted time extensions are granted; and



c)	closely monitor the implementation of infrastructure projects and consider the imposition of legal remedies on contractors, if found negligent or at fault, in line with pertinent provisions of RA 9184.



12)	ISU Jones and Cauayan Campuses commented that liquidated damages were imposed on the defaulting contractors. They also assured the Audit Team that they will strictly abide by the recommendations for all future infrastructure projects.



13)	ISU San Mateo Campus assured their compliance with the audit recommendations. They have also submitted additional documents pertaining to the Infrastructure Project discussed in the AOM.



14)	On the other hand, ISU Echague Infrastructure Office commented that with regard to requests for time extensions, they make sure that only reasonable time extensions were approved and granted. As to the unnecessary time extensions granted, they informed the Audit Team that liquidated damages were imposed on Contractors who incurred delay in the completion of the projects.





1)	Several Requests for Quotations (RFQs) were falsified impairing the regularity of the transactions which did not result from comparison of valid price quotations from at least three (3) bona fide Suppliers as required under Section 52.3 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 and punishable under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.



1)	Section 52.3 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 states that under Section 52.1(b) of this IRR, at least three (3) price quotations from bona fide Suppliers shall be obtained. Section 52.1(b) being referred to in this Section refers to Shopping which is an alternative method of procurement of goods whereby the Procuring Entity simply requests for the submission of price quotations for readily available off-the-shelf goods or ordinary/regular equipment to be procured directly from Suppliers of known qualifications. It can be employed for procurement of ordinary or regular office supplies and equipment not available in the Procurement Service involving an amount not exceeding the thresholds prescribed in Annex “H” of this IRR, which is P1,000,000.00 for NGAs, GOCCs, GFIs, SUCs, and Autonomous Regional Governments. 



2)	Audit of the disbursement vouchers of ISU Echague, Ilagan and Roxas Campuses from January to December 2020 showed that procurement of meals and snacks, construction materials, office, agricultural and marine supplies were regularly made through Shopping.



3)	In the course of audit, it was observed that the above-mentioned items were repeatedly procured from the same Suppliers. The Audit Team also observed inconsistencies on the signatures of supposed representatives of losing Suppliers in the RFQs. For this reason, random verification was made on the authenticity of signatures and amounts indicated in the said document.



4)	Result of the verification on the authenticity of Suppliers’ or authorized representatives’ signature in the selected RFQs proved that the amount and signatures were falsified. One Supplier of ISU Roxas also said that it was impossible for them to submit quotation because they do not have the items. 



5)	Based from the obtained pieces of evidence, the Audit Team was able to establish that these RFQs were fabricated, signatures were falsified, and the RFQs were fictitious.



6)	Among the Suppliers who did not acknowledge the signatures and amounts stated in the RFQs are the following:

No. of RFQs Verified

No. of RFQs with Authentic Signatures

No. of RFQs with Falsified Signatures

8)	ISU Ilagan Campus awarded to Ilagan Goodluck Trading an aggregate amount of P447,542.01 as a result of canvass taken, on which Angelie’s Trading is one among those Suppliers who quoted an amount, which was concluded to be fabricated.



9)	Procurement of meals and snacks were usually awarded also to Cristy’s Snack House, totaling to P664,705.00 during the period audited; and Digna’s Lechon is also one among those caterers that has fabricated RFQs. According to her, they do not provide catering services and denied submitting quotation to ISU Ilagan Campus.



10)	ISU Roxas Campus’ total amount of affected transactions is P956,935.60.



11)	Falsification of public documents is punishable by law under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code, as follows:



“Art. 171. Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister. — The penalty of prision mayor and a fine not to exceed P5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts: 



1)	Counterfeiting or imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;



2)	Causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate; xxx” 



12)	The irregularities found in the supporting RFQs of various procurement transactions are clear manifestations that the requirement of obtaining at least three (3) RFQs from bona fide Suppliers were not adhered to. It also gives impression that the University may have deliberately favored some Suppliers. As such, the University was not assured that the price obtained were the lowest in the market, and the goods procured were the most advantageous for the government. 



13)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the canvassers to submit their comments; and

 

b)	conduct an investigation on the Canvassers of ISU Echague, Ilagan, and Roxas Campuses for committing falsification of signatures and fabrication of price quotations in several RFQs; and reprimand, if warranted. 



14)	The Executive Officers of ISU Echague conducted Orientation to all persons involved and they committed to strictly conduct verification, particularly on RFQs, to comply with Section 52.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184.



15)	Engr. Freddie R. Orperia, Executive Officer of ISU Ilagan Campus requested to be given time to scrutinize, seek legal advice and comprehensively review the information supplied regarding the alleged falsification of signatures and fabrication of price quotations.



16)	No Management comment was received from ISU Roxas Campus Administrator, but the VP for Administrative and Finance Services issued Memorandum No. 18, s. 2021, directing compliance with the said audit recommendations.

 



1)	Undelivered goods namely, transformer and converted vehicles, amounting to P326,665.56 and P125,370.00, respectively, were paid, supported by falsified Inspection and Acceptance Report which is contrary to laws, rules, and regulations.

	

1)	Section 19, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I provides that, “Receipt, Inspection and Acceptance of PPE. Receipt of items purchased by the agency/entity shall be inspected by the inspection officer/committee before acceptance by the Supply and/or Property Custodian. Acceptance shall be made only if the PPE delivered conform to the standards and specifications in the PO (Appendix 61). Inspection and acceptance shall be made using the IAR (Appendix 62).”



2)	On October 23, 2019, ISU Roxas Campus paid MNIS Construction for 1 unit transformer and accessories amounting to P326,665.56. Perusal of the disbursement voucher revealed that this was inspected and accepted by the Inspector and Supply Officer, evidenced by the duly signed Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR). However, on the scheduled date of inspection on February 12, 2020, they admitted that the transformer is not yet delivered to the Campus. 



3)	Further, on November 5, 2019, fifty percent (50%) of the conversion costs for two (2) vehicles were paid to Fenix CEZA International Inc. (CEZA) aggregating to P125,370.00. Concerned officials stated that these vehicles were donated by CEZA to the Campus. However, no deed of donation was executed to prove the same. There were also no contracts executed detailing the services they have availed, total contract cost and contract duration, among others. A document showing the estimated cost for unit conversion is attached to the voucher, however, its validity is questionable due to the lack of signatures thereon. Moreover, official receipts were not obtained by the University from the payee evidencing their receipt of the payments made. Instead, only an acknowledgement receipt was given. Again, the Inspector and Supply Officer affixed their signatures in the IAR even when the subject vehicles were not yet delivered to the Campus. 



4)	Mr. Terry Bautista, Inspection Officer, and Mr. Herminio L. Lomboy, Supply Officer 1, both of ISU Roxas, who intentionally placed their signatures to these documents even when no actual deliveries were made compromised the integrity of the Inspection and Acceptance Report, and tantamount to falsification of document as stated in Article 171 (4) of the Revised Penal Code.



5)	These circumstances only show the laxity in the internal controls in the Campus. The practice of affixing signatures without ensuring that the goods procured are completely delivered and in accordance with the specifications, defeats the purpose of the IAR, which is a control mechanism that ensures that only goods delivered and in conformity with the specifications are paid for by the government. This violation exposes government funds to the risk of loss and misappropriation. Moreover, payment for undelivered PPEs is tantamount to advance payment which is prohibited under Section 88(1) of PD 1445. 



6)	As at this writing, the transformer was already delivered and installed in the ISU Roxas Campus. However, no document was provided showing the actual date of delivery. 



7)	On the other hand, the two (2) vehicles remain undelivered. Consequently, ND Nos. 2020-05-164 Roxas (19) and 2020-06-164 Roxas (19) were issued for the amounts paid for the undelivered vehicles equivalent to P62,050.00 and P63,320.00, respectively.



8)	We recommended that Management :



a)	require the Supply Officer to obtain the Delivery Receipt of the transformer for the computation of liquidated damages to be collected from MNIS Construction due to the late delivery and installation of the transformer and its accessories;



b)	require the concerned officials to obtain a Deed of Donation on the two (2) vehicles, execute a contract on the vehicle conversion, and require Fenix CEZA International Inc. to issue official receipts on the payments made; 



c)	require the Inspector and Supply Officers to:



		i)	submit written explanations why they affixed their signatures in the IAR despite non-delivery of the items; and 



		ii)	refrain from affixing their signatures in the IAR without verifying the actual delivery of the goods procured and their conformity with the specifications.



d)	stop the practice of giving advance payment to undelivered goods in compliance with Section 88 (1) of PD 1445.



9)	The Property Inspector and Supply Officer of ISU Roxas commented that there was an internal arrangement before, by the committee concerned, that they have to facilitate the liquidation of the savings derived from the Construction of the Two-Storey Building with Mini Theater, otherwise, the fund will be reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury. Thus, the complete documents of the voucher were prepared and fast tracked despite non-delivery of the item. They signed the IAR with the assurance from the dealer that it will be delivered on time. However, according to the dealer, there were some circumstances that are beyond his control causing the delay on the delivery of the unit. Admitting to this violation, they assured the Audit Team that this will not be repeated anymore. 





1)	Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account balance of P420,488,435.93 is understated by P10,410,554.35 due to: (a) unrecorded book reconciling items; (b) discrepancy between the adjusted balance per Bank Reconciliation Statements and University books for the accounts of ISU Cauayan Campus; and (c) unrecorded cash balances of bank accounts maintained for Senior High School by ISU Roxas and Cabagan Campuses.



1)	Sections 74 of PD 1445 provide that:



“Section 74. Monthly reports of depositories to agency head. 

At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.”

2)	Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I states, “The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.”



3)	Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) are prepared in order to check the correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s records. It also enables the agency to take up charges and credits recognized by the bank but are not yet recorded in the books to arrive at the accurate cash balance in the financial statements.



4)	During the year, Campus and University Accountants were able to prepare and submit monthly BRS on their cash accounts with GL balances aggregating to P420,205,397.93 at year-end. However, verification thereof showed that reconciling items aggregating to P6,474,775.68 remain unadjusted in the books, thereby understating the account balance, as shown below:

5)	The Bank Reconciliation Statements of ISU Cauayan Campus were not reconciled with the SL balance maintained by the University, showing a discrepancy of P3,020,431.82, inclusive of Deposits in Transit (DIT) aggregating to P56,206.30, which pertain to prior years reconciling items that remained to be unadjusted for many years.



6)	Moreover, no monthly BRS were prepared and submitted for the following SL accounts:

8)	The aforementioned deficiencies resulted in a misstated Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account in the books of the University. 









9)	We recommended that Management require:



a)	the concerned Campus Accountants and University Bookkeepers to record the identified book reconciling items aggregating to P6,474,775.68 in the books of the University;



b)	the ISU Cauayan Campus and University Bookkeepers to determine the nature of the discrepancies in the adjusted balance per Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) and University books amounting to P3,020,431.82 and record the appropriate adjusting entries, if necessary;



c)	that Monthly BRS be prepared and submitted on the three bank accounts with aggregate GL balance of P253,038.00; 



d)	the ISU Roxas and Cabagan Accounting Offices to submit all journals pertaining to the recently opened bank accounts for Senior High School to the University Accounting Office with bank balances aggregating to P915,346.85 for recording in the books of accounts; and



e)	Campus Accountants to use the GL balances presented in the University books in the preparation of Monthly BRS to ensure timely detection and recording of all reconciling items.



10)	The University Accountant informed the Audit Team that adjusting journal entries were already prepared and recorded in the books of FC 05 (161), FC 07 (Special Projects, CVARRD, and Scholarship Funds) of ISU Echague Campus. Moreover, Campus Accountants were directed to submit necessary journal entries and all journals on the Senior High School bank accounts for recognition in the books.



11)	ISU Cabagan Campus Accountant informed the Audit Team that no balances for ISU Palanan Campus amounting to P88,450.00 are being maintained in their books. She further submitted BRS for the Senior High School and JEVs for the recording of the noted book reconciling items.













2)	Past due accounts aggregating P32,453,465.01 or 63.50% of the total Loans and Receivables Account as at December 31, 2020 totalling P51,109,734.70 denote poor collection efficiency of the University due to inadequate monitoring and lenient actions, contrary to Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005, thus, depriving the Campuses of the much needed funds which could be used to finance its programs/projects/activities and sustain the operations of its income generating enterprises, and rendered the recorded Receivables and Allowance for Impairment Losses in the Financial Statements of the University doubtful.



1)	Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 requires all government entities to conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable. Section 7.1 of the same Circular also demands the Accountants of government agencies to regularly conduct verification, analysis and validation of the existence of receivables. 



2)	Moreover, Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that an entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired when there is a loss in the future economic benefits due to uncertainty of collectability of the receivables or the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable as explained under Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2016-005. 



3)	If any such evidence exists, the carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through the use of an allowance account. In case of Accounts Receivable (AR), the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts.



4)	The Statement of Financial Position of Isabela State University as at December 31, 2020 showed a gross amount of Loans and Receivable Account amounting to P51,109,734.70 and Allowance for Impairment Losses of P2,000,828.13 with a net amount of  P49,108,906.57. 



5)	For the year 2020, the Loans and Receivable Account has a net increase of P11,488,142.24 which comprises of uncollected school fees for the last four (4) School Semesters from 2019-2021.	 



6)	On the other hand, analysis on the Ageing of Loans and Receivable account of the University revealed the following:

		i)	Accounts Receivable under Business-Type Income Fund derives from sales and earnings from different Income Generating Enterprises of the University under the University Business Affairs Office totaling P2,221,114.65. However, this amount could not be relied upon due to non-submission of Schedule/Ageing of Accounts Receivable of ISU Roxas totaling P662,415.00. On the other hand, analysis on the Ageing of Accounts Receivable of ISU Echague disclosed inaccuracy in the ageing of its accounts, as follows:

		ii)	Further assessment revealed that long overdue balances stemmed from desktop printing project, fish pond rental and milled rice project of the University. The Audit Team also noted that 80% of its receivable on IGE is collectible from former/current employees of the University while 20% are from non-employees. Inquiry with Management disclosed that they were sending collection notice to the defaulting employees, however, they failed to send demand/collection letters for the years 2019-2020. As a result, the total amount of P2,221,114.65 fall past due as at December 31, 2020. Non-collection of these long overdue receivables has deprived the IGEs of ISU Echague and Roxas Campus of the much needed funds to sustain its operation, since IGEs are considered self-liquidating and the revenues generated are to be utilized for its operational expenses.



b)	Loans and Receivable under Internally Generated Income with a net amount of P45,526,869.59 



i)	Loans and Receivables under Internally Generated Income Fund with a net amount of P45,526,869.59, consist of uncollected school fees from students during the First Semester of Academic Year 2015-2016 to 2020-2021 and collectibles from students who availed Financial Assistance Program, Former Pres. Gloria M. Arroyo - Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) Loan, Students Loan Assistance Program (SLAP) Loan and Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) Loan, of which, 60.55% of the loan portfolio remain uncollected for more than a year. Inquiry with Management disclosed that account balances of students were only followed-up verbally and updated upon enrolment of the students. Moreover, the Audit Team was informed that there is no specific office assigned in the monitoring and sending collection letters to defaulting students. Hence, overdue balances of all students who discontinued from studying, graduated, dropped and transferred could not be strictly monitored and effectively collected.



ii)	Based on the Notes to Financial Statements, the University sets the Allowance for Impairment from the Accounts Receivable at a level adequate to provide for potential uncollectability of receivables derived from computations based on percentages and aging of accounts receivable. Allowance for Impairment was provided every year based on age of receivables and percentage rate provided in Section 10, Volume I of the GAM, as follows:



1 - 60 days

1%

61 - 180 days

2%

181 days - 1 year

3%

iii)	However, Loans and Receivable account under Internally Generated Income Fund specifically Fund 164 amounting to P1,248,061.89 was not provided an allowance for impairment, considering that these accounts were already long overdue. Moreover, it was not also supported with a detailed schedule which could hamper in the proper monitoring and evaluation on the said accounts. Hence, Allowance for Impairment Loss Account was understated consequently overstating Loans Receivable Account under Fund 164.



c)	Loans and Receivable on Trust Fund with a net amount of P1,516,490.28



i)	Further analysis on the ageing of Loans and Receivables under Trust Fund revealed the following:

ii)	As can be gleaned from the above table, the Loans and Receivables remain uncollected and some are non-moving for more than 10 years which can be considered as Dormant Receivable Accounts. Moreover, analysis on the collection efficiency of the University disclosed a collection rate on SAFE Loan of less than 10% since August 2008 and STUFAP of 65.88% since March 2004, presented as follows:

iii)		The low collection efficiency rate indicates that monitoring of the compliance of student grantees on their obligations of paying the SAFE Loan was not properly imposed by the University. The obligation of ISU also on monitoring or tracking the whereabouts of the student grantees was not effectively executed. Inquiry with the Accounting Office informed that they have no information on the whereabouts of the student grantees with remaining outstanding balance, thus, enforcement of collection of loans is unfeasible considering that these accounts were already dormant for more than 10 years.



7)	Given the factors such as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the University, and identified doubtful accounts, the Management should have conducted a thorough assessment and provided a 100 percent Allowance for Impairment to present fairly the balances of the receivable accounts in the FS of the University.



8)	We recommended that Management:

a)		ensure that services/sales on credit extended to employees/external clients in IGE are collected within a reasonable period of time and desist from granting additional credit to employees/external clients who have unsettled accounts with the IGE;

	

b)		intensify collection efforts by periodically sending communications through collection/demand letters, electronic mails, phone calls and social media to those with unsettled accounts in order not to deprive the University of much needed funds to support its operations;

	

c)		exert extra effort in determining the whereabouts of existing student grantees that have outstanding loan balance in order to impose their obligations in the Promissory Note that they have executed and collect the same; 

	 

d)		review available documents relative to the dormant accounts, and in case it could no longer be collected, request from COA for an authority to write - off the accounts with complete supporting documents as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005; and

	

e)		formulate or adopt a policy to determine the collectability of the receivable accounts based on the factors mentioned in Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs such as aging of accounts, collection experiences, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts to properly recognize the appropriate allowance for impairment. 

	

9)	The VP for AFS issued Memorandum No. 42, s. 2021 directing all concerned officials to comply with the audit recommendations.



10)	The University Accountant explained that the Echague CBAO collected a sum of P411,403.81 from its debtors for CY 2020. He also informed that the CBAO Director, in a meeting conducted last February 17, 2021, committed to collect overdue balances thru sending demand letters and billings to debtors and thru salary deduction from concerned employees. He further required the submission from concerned Accountants of Ageing of ARs and detailed schedules of Loans Receivables for impairment. He further assured their compliance with the audit recommendations.





1)	Cash Advances and Other Receivables amounting to P1,469,283.04 and P1,715,714.47, respectively, remained outstanding as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 6.1 of COA Circular 2016-005 and Item 5.1 of COA Circular 97-002.

		

1)	Section 6.1 of COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 requires: “All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose.”



2)	Moreover, Item 5.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 requires accountable officers (AO) to liquidate their cash advances as follows:

“5.1.1 	Salaries, Wages, etc. – within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period;



5.1.2	Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses – within twenty (20) days after the end of the year, subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year;



5.1.3 	Official Travel – within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines, in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to permanent official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in E.O. 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004.”



3)	Review of the Status Report of Unliquidated Cash Advances (UCAs) and Other Receivables (ORs) disclosed that cash advances amounting to P1,469,283.04 remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 (Annex J). ORs amounting to P1,715,714.47 are also still outstanding (Annex K). 



4)	In order to enforce settlement of these UCAs, the Audit Team issued demand letters to defaulting AOs, who are still connected to the agency, requiring them to settle their accountabilities, 30 days from receipt thereof. However, as at this date, the Audit Team has yet to receive the liquidation reports of these AOs. Non-liquidation of these cash advances is a ground for the withholding of salaries or any money due to the defaulting AO and a “prima facie” presumption under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code of malversation of the funds for their personal use or benefit.



5)	Based on the report, cash advances aggregating to P230,706.42 have been outstanding for more than ten years already and are considered dormant accounts (Annex L). In the AOM No. 2018-009 dated March 5, 2018, the Audit Team had recommended the filing by the Management of a request for authority to write-off these dormant UCAs. Although a request was filed on February 11, 2019, this was returned because of insufficiency of documents submitted. A follow-up letter dated June 18, 2020 was issued reiterating the submission of request for authority to write-off dormant accounts together with the documents required under COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, however, said request was not yet filed to the Audit Team.



6)	On the other hand, ORs amounting to P1,715,714.47 are still uncollected and outstanding in the books of the University. The amount of P1,595,594.97 are cash shortages of previous collecting officers, while the amount of P86,701.10 has no known debtor. No documents are also available to validate the same. 



7)	The accumulation of outstanding cash advances and presence of dormant accounts only show the inadequacy of the University’s review, analysis, and monitoring of the accounts and enforcement of liquidation of cash advances within the prescribed period. It also resulted from the non-observance of the rules and regulations in the granting of cash advances, specifically on the prohibition of granting additional cash advances to officers and employees with outstanding previous cash advances. This rule is always disregarded in most ISU Campuses despite numerous audit recommendations already issued to correct the same. These weaknesses in the University’s internal control resulted in unreliable data being presented in the University’s books and poses risk to possible misappropriation of government funds. 



8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	withhold the payment of salaries or any money due to the defaulting AOs who failed to liquidate their cash advances within 30 days from receipt of Demand Letters;



b)	refrain from granting additional cash advances to officers and employees with outstanding cash advances;



c)	submit a request for authority to write off dormant accounts together with the documents required under COA Circular 2016-05;



d)	determine the composition and collectability of the P86,701.10 reported under Other Receivables account and prepare necessary adjusting entry, if warranted; and



e)	conduct a regular review, analysis, and monitoring of all receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances are liquidated within the prescribed period. 



9)	The VP for Administrative and Finance Services issued Memorandum No.159, S. 2020 dated December 21, 2020, directing the Concerned Offices to comply with the Audit Recommendations.





1)	Liquidated damages amounting to P586,362.57 were not imposed against the concerned Suppliers for the delays incurred in the delivery of goods procured by Campuses contrary to Section 68 of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act.



1)	Section 68 of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, provides the following:



“Section 68. Liquidated Damages



All contracts executed in accordance with the Act and this IRR shall contain a provision on liquidated damages which shall be payable by the contractor in case of breach thereof. For the procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services, the amount of the liquidated damages shall be at least equal to one-tenth of one percent (0.001) of the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of delay. Once the cumulative amount of liquidated damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contract, the Procuring Entity may rescind or terminate the contract, without prejudice to other courses of action and remedies available under the circumstances. (a)”



2)	In connection, Annex D, Item 3 of the same IRR details the following:



“3. Liquidated Damages



3.1. 	When the Supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the Supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned.”



3)	Audit disclosed that there were delays in the delivery of procured goods of the nine (9) Campuses of ISU; however, liquidated damages were not imposed against the concerned Suppliers (Annex M).

4)	Table shows that 164 transactions totaling P13,481,371.92 were not correspondingly imposed liquidated damages aggregating P586,362.57 for the year 2019-2020. Based on the data gathered, the Management’s laxity in the execution of Purchase Orders and for failure to properly accomplish the appropriate terms and conditions resulted in non-imposition of liquidated damages to delayed delivery of goods.



5)	Also, Audit Team has observed that some Campuses had indicated the actual date of delivery under the terms and conditions in the PO. It should be pointed out that terms and conditions shall contain the expected or required date of delivery consistent with the delivery term indicated in the Request for Quotation.	



6)	Moreover, it shall be noted that in case the place and delivery is not stated in the PO, the date of delivery shall mean seven (7) calendar days after the receipt of the PO by the Supplier pursuant to Appendix 61 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume II. Moreover, as a general rule, when the date of conformity was required but not indicated by the Supplier, the date when such requirement is needed will be the date, in this case, the date of PO. It must be emphasized that it is incumbent upon the Campuses to ensure that the PO was properly accomplished and the date of conformity properly acknowledged by the Supplier to appropriately determine and imposed liquidated damages, if any.



7)	We recommended that Management impose and collect liquidated damages amounting to P586,362.57 from the concerned Suppliers for the delay in the delivery of procured goods in adherence to Section 68 of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184, known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, otherwise a Notice of Disallowance shall be issued. Henceforth, ensure that all necessary information in the Purchase Order are properly accomplished and acknowledged by the Supplier. Furthermore, we recommended that Management ensure that goods are delivered within the specified contract time. 



8)	ISU San Mariano Campus has fully collected the liquidated damages from the defaulting Supplier. 



9)	In a letter dated February 22, 2021, the Executive Officer of ISU Echague appealed for consideration not to enforce liquidated damages to concerned Suppliers on particular transactions due to their failure to properly accomplish the PO. Henceforth, the Management issued a memorandum to all concerned offices to strictly accomplish the necessary information in the PO to avoid irregularities. 



10)	The Campus Administrator of ISU San Mateo commented that the delay in the delivery of procured goods were incurred due to travel restriction and localized lockdown in some municipalities due to COVID-19 pandemic. Henceforth, she committed that the audit recommendation will be strictly followed.  



11)	ISU Roxas commented that due to force majeure, the said item was not delivered on time, because the COVID-19 Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases issued resolutions to the province of Bohol, the expected origin of the goods, and Manila, where the said item must pass through. The said resolution was prolonged from time to time since May 1 to August 2018 due to the increasing number of COVID victims. Hence, the Campus Administrator appealed that the current situation warrants that the Supplier was in good faith of doing his part, only that it was hindered by deadly catastrophe.



12)	The Management of ISU Cauayan explained that many of the suppliers were not able to deliver the procured goods on time due to unavoidable circumstances caused by the pandemic. However, they also informed the Audit Team that measures were already taken to impose liquidated damages to those suppliers who were not able to deliver due to other reasons not mentioned above and have committed to comply with the audit recommendations.



13)	Meanwhile, the Management of ISU Angadanan requested for time extension to submit their respective comments on the said audit finding.



14)	On the other hand, the Campus Accountant of ISU Cabagan informed that the date of Purchase Orders (PO) is not the actual date of receipt but the date of its preparation, after which it is being forwarded to the Budget Office for the preparation of ORS/BURs, obligated and then forwarded to the Accounting Office for the determination of availability of cash allocation. Moreover, the Procurement Officer informed the Audit Team that there are instances when vouchers are funded a few weeks or months after awarding date (date of PO). Also, the Campus Accountant of ISU Cabagan stated that when PO is served, the Supplier do not make any commitment for the immediate delivery of the supplies/materials listed in the PO because there are times that stocks are not available and there are instances that such items have to be procured outside the country leaving no choice but to wait for the stocks, provided, they are just in time when needed (emphasis ours). On the other hand, she also mentioned that Suppliers prioritize those business establishments paying in cash; hence, government agencies are not the priority customers. She further stated that they have to accept respective Supplier’s offer without committing themselves to the provisions stated in the PO while ensuring that such payment shall only be made upon full delivery of all items covered in the PO. Furthermore, the Procurement Officer of ISU Cabagan also commented that once the PO is ready for serving, the travel needed to serve the PO is being restricted/limited due to the current pandemic situation.



15)	The Audit Team finds the comments of the ISU Cabagan as an admission of laxity in the processing of procurement on goods, and disregarding the necessity/importance/significance of the Purchase Order which should be the binding document between the Agency and the Supplier.





1)	Unprogrammed utilization of the 3% allocation for administrative support from funds received for Tertiary Education Subsidy resulted in non-allocation of resources to activities that could have improved the implementation of the program. 



1)	Section 2 of the PD 1445 otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states that:



“Section 2. Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of the government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



2)	The Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) is one of the four components of RA 10931 known as the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017. This program supports the cost of tertiary education of qualified grantees covering their allowance for books, supplies, transportation, miscellaneous personal expenses, including a reasonable allowance for documented rental or purchase of personal computer or laptop, and other education-related expenses; and allowance for room and board costs incurred by the student.



3)	For Academic Year 2018-2019 and 1st Semester 2019-2020, a total of P113,979,800.00 was transferred by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the implementation of the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) program recognized in the Books of Accounts as Due to NGAs under Fund 07. Liquidation reports aggregating to P84,666,000.00 were submitted of which the remaining balance as at December 31, 2020 amounted to P29,313,800.00.



4)	Three percent (3%) of the TES, or an equivalent of P3,319,800.00, were allocated for Administrative Support pursuant to Section 5.0 of UniFAST Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 2018 providing the guidelines on the implementation of the Tertiary Education Subsidy for Filipino students.



5)	The provisions of the above MCs require the use of the 3% allocation to ensure the proper implementation of the program. This includes conduct of activities such as Advocacy and Promotions, Technical Assistance, Remedial/Mentoring Program, Meetings and Orientations, Monitoring and Evaluation, and day-to-day operations. 



6)	Moreover, Section XIII.1.1 of CHED-UNIFAST-DBM Joint Memorandum Circular No. 04 s. 2020 providing the Enhanced Guidelines on the Tertiary Education Subsidy Program states that the Administrative Support Cost (ASC) shall cover expenses on monitoring, notarization of documents, office supplies and materials, salary of project technical staff or job order, communication, transportation/travel, remedial/mentoring program and meetings/orientation/seminars/general assembly and cash cards that will be issued to the TES grantees, among others.



7)	However, per submitted liquidation reports, it was noted that only ISU Echague and ISU San Mateo for the year 2019, and ISU Cabagan for the year 2020, were able to charge expenses incurred on the conduct of Orientation Programs with the grantees while other campuses incurred expenses mainly for reporting and day-to-day operations. Post-audit also revealed that funds were used for the procurement of Information and Technology (IT) Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, and Semi-Expendable Equipment, Office Supplies and Communication Expenses of offices/officials not directly responsible for the implementation of the TES Scholarship Program and for activities not related to the program.



8)	Purchase of IT Equipment was allowed under UniFAST MC No. 2018-001 dated March 26, 2018 but this item was already excluded under the existing guidelines. While the purchase of Semi-Expendable Equipment and Furniture & Fixtures are not among the identified expenses that may be covered by the ASC. Also, one of the fundamental principles governing financial transactions and operations require Trust Funds to be utilized for the specific purpose for which it was created. Thus, charging of any expenses not related to the program being implemented is not acceptable.



9)	In order to ensure that all the activities necessary for the implementation of the program will be undertaken and the related financial requirements are made available for the purpose, financial programs or budgets should be made. It is a control mechanism that safeguards the funds against possible misappropriation or wastage. Failure of the Agency to prepare program/budget for the utilization of 3% Administrative Support exposing the funds under the control and  disposition of the officers and employees concerned  who eventually  may charge irrelevant expenses against the funds, or non-utilization thereof, which ultimately  discounting the needs of the TES Scholarship Program.



10)	Scrutiny on the submitted liquidation reports disclosed that administrative cost aggregating to P227,941.06 remained unutilized (Annex N). This amount could have gone a long way in the conduct of significant activities called for in the above MCs to ensure the proper implementation of the TES Scholarship Program.



11)	We recommended that Management require all Campus Scholarship Coordinators for TES Program  to submit a Proposal for the Utilization of 3% Administrative Cost for succeeding fund releases, subject to the review and approval of the Administration and Finance Department, to ensure that all significant activities for the implementation of the Scholarship Program be included and prioritized.



12)	ISU Cauayan informed the Audit Team that they have also conducted an Orientation Program with the grantees on April 19, 2019. 



13)	Proposals for the utilization of the 3% Administrative Cost were submitted by ISU Cauayan, San Mateo, Echague, Jones, Cabagan, and Roxas Campuses.  





1)	Project funds were used for expenses aggregating to P506,122.98 unrelated to the project being implemented, in violation of Section 4(3) of PD 1445 otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines and the Project’s Memorandum of Agreement.



1)	Section 4 of PD 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines enumerates the Fundamental Principles governing financial transactions and operations of all government agencies. Item 3 thereof states that: 



“Trust Funds shall be available and may be spent or used solely for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds received.”



2)	On December 2, 2016, Isabela State University through the then President, Dr. Emilia A. Martinez, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Commission on Higher Education (CHED), through the then Chairperson, Dr. Patricia B. Licuanan, for the implementation of the project entitled: Enhancing Ecosystem Services on Food and Freshwater in Rain-fed Agricultural Areas at Cagayan Valley. The amount of P15,000,000.00 was received by ISU from CHED for the implementation of this project.



3)	Item 2.3 of the Project’s Memorandum of Agreement requires ISU to properly utilize the funds provided by the CHED and shall see to it that these are used for the purpose for which the same are intended, in accordance with the approved Work and Financial Plan and Terms of Reference, and subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 



4)	The Project’s Line Item Budget (LIB) showed provisions for Personal Services, Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses, Capital Outlay and Administrative Cost. The Administrative Cost, equivalent to 7.5% of the total budget, was given total allocation of P1,125,000.00.



5)	Administrative cost, as commonly used in Special Projects funded by different National Government Agencies, is an indirect cost which refers to overhead expenses incurred by the implementing or monitoring agency in managing, evaluation, and monitoring of the program/project. (DOST Administrative Order No. 009, s. 2017) 



6)	Contrary thereto, post-audit showed that expenditures aggregating to P506,122.98 not related to the project being implemented were charged against project funds, specifically in the  Administrative Cost, broken down as follows:



Account Title

Amount

Remarks

Representation Expenses

P 139,296.00

For ISU Ilagan CE Faculty Office

TOTAL

P 506,122.98



Details in Annex O



7)	The above expenses should not have been charged to the Project’s Administrative Cost because these are not monitoring or evaluation activities. Moreover, the above PPEs should not have been purchased using project funds because these are not included in the identified equipment to be purchased in the LIB and are not used exclusively for the project. 



8)	Utilization of trust funds should always be in conformity with the Line Item Budget and Memorandum of Agreement. We believe that the University has enough funds from other sources that could have been used for the above purposes. Charging these expenses reduced the funds available for various significant activities which could have been conducted by the Project Team or the University to ensure that the project is implemented properly, as planned, and on time. 



9)	We recommended that Management stop the practice of utilizing project funds on expenses not related to the Project in accordance with Section 4(3) of PD 1445 and the Project’s Memorandum of Agreement; and return the funds used for these unrelated expenses to the Funding Agency. 



10)	Dr. Junel B. Soriano, Project Leader, commented that externally funded special projects allows the Administration or Head of the Institution as Grantee to disburse the said amount in support to the operation as well as the development of the Institution. He also justified that the disbursements were spent based on the approved LIB under Administrative Cost and was distributed to the different offices who were involved in the implementation of the project. The Administration or the Executive Officer is authorized to use the said allocation in coordination with the Project Management Office. He further stated that ISU Ilagan has no available funds during that time to purchase the said supplies, materials and services and that Administrative Cost is a form of incentives to the Grantee that shall be used to harness growth and improve its services which may not be directly linked to the project Management and implementation.



11)	Contrary to the Project Leader’s statement, the project’s administrative cost must be utilized for the purpose for which it was intended, that is, for the proper implementation of the project. It is not intended to support the operations of the University because other funds have already been appropriated for this purpose. As such, Notices of Disallowance were issued by the Audit Team for the unrelated expenses charged against the project funds.  





1)	ISU Roxas Campus incurred unnecessary expenditures aggregating to P178,950.00 in acquiring, through transfer, unserviceable properties from the Office of the Solicitor General, 90% of which are sitting idle in the storage room of the Campus because of their unusable condition. 



1)	Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states that:



“Section 2. Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of the government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



2)	Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines Unnecessary Expenditures as those which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. These are expenditures which are not supportive of the implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation. This would also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time. An expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary. 



3)	The ISU Roxas Campus, represented by Former Campus Administrator Quirino D. Parallag, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), represented by Solicitor General Jose C. Calida, for the transfer, by donation, of unserviceable properties from OSG to ISU Roxas. The Agreement states that ISU Roxas is in need of unserviceable properties which are to be used in the Campus. It further states that ISU Roxas is obligated to pick-up the items at the OSG Office at its own cost. 	



4)	The Property Transfer Report showed that 549 items composing of air conditioning units, sound system, television, laptops, CPUs, servers, computer monitors, UPS, printers, scanners, barcode printers, projectors, switch hub, type writers, rapid-prints, binding machines, mailing system, sofas, refrigerator, big tables and office chairs were received by Dr. Parallag from the OSG in May 2019. These were picked-up by ISU from December 2019 to January 2020. In order for the said transfer to materialize, expenses aggregating to P178,950.00 were incurred by the Campus, as follows:



		Particulars

Amount

Travelling Expenses

P 52,950.00

Fuel Expenses

56,000.00

Rent Expenses

70,000.00

TOTAL

P 178,950.00



5)	From the outset, the benefit that ISU can obtain on the transfer of unserviceable properties from OSG is unclear, putting into question the necessity of the MOA and incurrence of these expenses. This is because unserviceable properties are no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic benefits and service potential (Section 40c, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I) which is basically the reason why these are required to be disposed according to Section 79 of PD 1445. Besides, inspection that these are beyond repair, obsolete, and has no more utilization potential.



6)	Moreover, contrary to what is stated in the MOA that ISU is in need of unserviceable properties, records show that only 56 of the 549 items transferred, or an equivalent of 10%, are being utilized by the different offices while the remaining items are in the storage rooms, deteriorating further. If ISU is really in need of unserviceable properties, these transferred properties should have been immediately used according to their intended purposes. 



7)	Considering the unusable conditions and the minimal utilization of these unserviceable properties, it can be inferred that there is no use in transferring the properties to ISU as these only added to the volume of unserviceable properties already stored in the Campus, awaiting disposal.  Had the Management properly weighed the pros and cons prior to entering into MOA with the OSG, government funds should not have been incurred for transactions that are not beneficial to the Campus.   



8)	We recommended that Management require:



a)	the Former Campus Administrator to submit an explanation about the reasons why the ISU Roxas Campus entered into Memorandum of Agreement with the Office of the Solicitor General for the transfer of unserviceable properties, despite their unusable condition, and justify why the related transactions should not be disallowed in audit; and



b)	the Supply Officer to conduct inventory and inspection and prepare the corresponding Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties. 



9)	ISU Roxas Former Campus Administrator justified that in his quest for additional Campus facilities with lesser expenses, he requested the Office of the Solicitor General for the donation of unused office equipment for Campus consumption which they have evaluated to be usable after undergoing simple repairs at minimal cost. He further contended that 40 units of executive chairs and 40 units of office tables have already undergone repairs with estimated cost of 0.8 Million compared to the expenses of P178,950.00 incurred for the transfer. For these reasons, he stated that the incurrence of these expenses are favorable for the University. 





1)	Requisitions for gasoline amounting to P2,794,728.06 for CY2020 were not supported with adequate documentation, contrary to COA Circular 77-61, thus, monitoring of fuel consumption and usage of government vehicles is not facilitated while reasonableness and propriety of claims for fuel cannot be ascertained.



1)	Item 2 of COA Circular 77-61 dated September 26, 1977 states among others, that: “the use of government motor vehicles should be controlled through properly accomplished and duly approved Driver’s Trip Tickets which should be serially numbered, a summary of which shall be made at the end of the month in a Monthly Report of Official Travels, for audit purposes.”  



2)	Likewise, Item 7 of the same Circular states that: “no disbursement voucher for fuel consumption (gasoline and oil) of government vehicles shall be allowed in audit unless duly supported by properly accomplished and approved serially numbered driver’s trip tickets, and that the government vehicles involved are plainly marked “For Official Use Only” and bear government plates only with the exception of security vehicles exempt from using government plates.” 



3)	In addition, Section 2 of PD 1445 provides that: “it is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”   



4)	Audit conducted on transactions for fuel, oil and lubricants used for motor vehicles and machineries/equipment disclosed that total disbursements of P2,794,728.06 was expended for CY 2020.  Details are shown as follows:

5)	Perusal of the supporting documents disclosed that some Driver’s Trip Tickets were not properly accomplished specifically on the portion “To be filled up by the Driver.” Information such as: time of departure and arrival; approximate distance traveled; fuel issued/purchased/consumed; oil issued (gear, lubricant, grease, brake fluid); balance in tank & loaded before trip; were not stated, providing no bases in determining if the fuel consumed is excessive or not.  Likewise, all trip tickets were not serially numbered as well, thus, the use of government vehicles is not properly monitored. 



6)	Moreover, Monthly Reports of Official Travel and Monthly Reports of Fuel Consumption were not submitted, thus, the reasonableness of fuel consumed during the period could not be verified. The cited regulation specifically requires that at the end of the month, a Monthly Report of Official Travels shall be prepared by the driver concerned summarizing in chronological order his trips for the month. For each vehicle, one report shall be prepared monthly. The report shall be certified by the driver and approved by the Administrative Officer.



7)	The failure of the Management to properly document the requisitions and consumption of fuel, oil and lubricants and poor monitoring on the use of government vehicles casts doubt on the reasonableness and propriety of claims for fuel and lubricants amounting to P2,794,728.06 for the year 2020. 



8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	adopt proper controls on the use and requisitions of fuel, oil and lubricants;



b)	strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular 77-1 on the accomplishment of Driver’s Trip Tickets; and



c)	require the concerned drivers to prepare the Monthly Report of Official Travels as well as the GSO to prepare Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and submit the same to the Office of the Auditor.

	

9)	ISU San Mateo and Jones Campuses committed to comply with the audit recommendations.



10)	The Executive Officer of ISU Cabagan Campus conducted a meeting with the drivers of the Campus reminding them of the documentary requirements for the gasoline expenses. The Campus Accountant assured the Audit Team of the proper documentation of succeeding payments.



11)	The GSO of Ilagan Campus committed to take into actions the recommendations indicated in our Finding.



12)	The Executive Officer of ISU Echague Campus directed the GSO Campus Director to prepare the Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and to strictly adhere to COA Circular 77-61.



13)	ISU Cauayan Campus explained that the Campus GSO has been monitoring the fuel consumption and usage of government vehicles to adhere to the law's provisions. However, during the pandemic, all the campus' vehicles were urgently used which may have caused the inadequacy in the monitoring and documentation of fuel consumption and usage of government vehicles. They have committed to comply with the audit recommendations and submitted the Monthly Report of Official Travels and Fuel Consumption.





1)	Repairs and Maintenance in an aggregate amount of P776,027.50 in the last 4 years was incurred by ISU Roxas for fully depreciated vehicles exceeding their combined book/residual values of P106,150.00 by P669,877.50, with lacking supporting documents enumerated under COA Circular 2012-001, and maybe considered as excessive expenditure under Annex D of COA Circular 2012-003.



1)	Item E.2, Part I of NBC No. 425 dated January 20, 1992, the Manual on Disposal of Government Property, considers a property as beyond economical repair when the cost of repair and maintenance becomes prohibitive and disadvantageous to the government considering such factor as maintenance expenses, downtime, replacement cost of spare parts, frequency of breakdown and alternative modes such as rental of equipment or outright replacement. Item B.2, Part II of the same regulation considers as disposable those properties whose maintenance costs of repair more than outweighs the benefits and services that will be derived from its continued use. 



2)	Moreover, Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 requires the following documentary requirements to support the disbursements for repairs and maintenance of motor vehicles, aircraft, and equipment:



a)	“Additional documents under Annexes Q and R of COA Memorandum NO. 2005-027 dated February 28, 2005 required to be submitted to the Auditor’s Office within five days from the execution of the contract:



--	Copy of the pre-repair evaluation report and approved detailed plans by the agency showing in sufficient detail the scope of work/extent of repair to be done

--	Copy of the latest service bulletin, in case of aircraft

--	Report of waste materials

--	Copy of document indicating history of repair



b)	Post-inspection reports

c)	Warranty Certificate

d)	Request for payment

e)	Bill/Invoices

f)	Pre-repair inspection reports

g)	Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof”



3)	Inventory Report of Motor Vehicles as at November 24, 2020, submitted by the Supply Office, showed that ISU Roxas owns five (5) vehicles. These vehicles, acquired from 1996 to 2016, are all fully depreciated but were still subjected to frequent repairs and maintenance. 



4)	Records documenting the repair history of these vehicles are not being maintained. However, perusal of the disbursement vouchers, Reports of Checks Issued and Check Disbursement Journals showed the following repairs and maintenance expenses which partly indicated the specific vehicle where they relate to:

----media/image1.emf----











5)	As shown above, the aggregate expenses from January 2017 to October 2020 amounting to P776,027.50 is already 731% of the vehicles’ total book values amounting to P106,150.00. And every year for the last 4 years, repairs and maintenance expenses exceeded the vehicles’ book values.



6)	As mentioned, the vehicles, which have been in service for 10 to 24 years already, are all fully depreciated. Their book values corresponds to the estimated residual values calculated as 5% of the original costs of the vehicles. PPSAS 17 defines residual value as the estimated amount that an entity would currently obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. As such, these expenses may be excessive because regulations only allow repairs and maintenance expenses up to 30% of the vehicles’ current market values. (Annex D of COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012)



7)	Considering the maintenance expenses incurred on these vehicles vis-à-vis the expected amount that the entity could obtain if these assets were disposed, repairs are already uneconomical. However, due to the non-monitoring and non-maintenance of records showing their repair history, repairs on these vehicles were continuously allowed in the Campus resulting in unnecessary and excessive expenditures of government funds. It should be emphasized that the funds spent on these repairs would be wasted as it can be expected that in a short period of time, the repaired vehicles would break down, thus, necessitating more repairs. 



8)	Further, validity of the Repairs and Maintenance Expenses aggregating to P448,207.50 is questionable because the exact vehicle that was repaired was not specified in the supporting documents. There were also no Reports on Pre-Evaluation, Pre-Repair and Post-Repair Inspections attached to all the vouchers pertaining to these expenses. These weaknesses in the internal control over the conduct of repairs and maintenance of vehicles, if not corrected, may negatively affect the financial health of the ISU Roxas Campus. 



9)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the Accounting Office to maintain Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards for all motor vehicles and record the repair history thereon to properly monitor the repairs and maintenance expenses incurred on these vehicles; 



b)	submit complete supporting documents and specify vehicles repaired when processing repairs; and



c)	preclude the further repair of vehicles that are considered beyond economical repair and consider the disposition thereof.



10)	The Former Campus Administrator of ISU Roxas commented that ISU Roxas has never acquired brand new service vehicles due to financial constraints. However, they were able to request second hand units from various agencies which were subjected to repairs. He justified that the repairs and maintenance of these vehicles are necessary for land preparation and in order not to paralyze daily operations considering that ISU Roxas maintains three (3) sites, has various extension activities covering the 26 barangays of Roxas, and has to attend to other important appointments that will benefit the operations of the Campus.















1)	Disbursements totaling P19,128,535.53 for the year 2020 of ISU Ilagan and Roxas Campuses were not supported with complete documents, contrary to Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus, the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls over the disbursements are deemed insufficient. Likewise, validity and propriety of the claims could not be ascertained.



1)	Section 4 of PD 1445 provides the fundamental principles that governs the financial transactions and operations of any government agency. Pertinent provision is quoted as follows:



“(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



2)	Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions which incorporated the requirements under existing issuances of this Commission.



3)	Post audit of transactions of the ISU Ilagan and Roxas Campuses disclosed that various disbursements aggregating to P19,128,535.53 were not adequately supported with complete documents as required in Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001. A summary of these disbursements including the observed deficiencies is presented in Annex P.



4)	For ISU Ilagan, common documentary deficiencies include missing signatures on the payrolls attached to the payments of salaries and wages; lacking trip tickets on fuel expenses; approved DTRs, Accomplishment Reports and Contracts on the wages of COS employees; original copies of Certificates of Appearance on travel expenses; Official Receipts on some remittances, Authority to render overtime, Overtime Work Program, approved DTRs, and Accomplishment Reports on overtime pay; and List of Recipients with Signatures of distributed goods and athletes’ uniforms; among others.



5)	On the other hand, for ISU Roxas, common documentary deficiencies include lacking Statements of Account on the payment of internet subscriptions; lacking signatures of passengers on the trip tickets; incomplete trip tickets; lacking contracts, approved DTRs, and Accomplishment Reports on the wages of COS employees; unapproved Travel Orders and on travel expenses; lacking original copies of Certificates of Appearance; missing proofs of payments; among others.



6)	The foregoing deficiencies indicate weakness in the internal control system considering that disbursements were processed and paid without complete documentation as provided in COA Circular 2012-001 and other pertinent rules and regulations. Thus, this casted doubt on the validity and propriety of the transactions. 



7)	We recommended that Management:



a)		require the Campus Accountants to submit immediately the lacking supporting documents of the paid DVs listed in Annex P to determine the validity and propriety of the transactions and to avoid issuance of Notices of Suspension; 



b)		direct the Campus Accountants to ensure that the supporting documents are properly accomplished, taking into consideration the deficiencies noted, before certifying and processing claims against the funds of the Campus; and



c)		direct the Cashier to submit the original copies of Official Receipts for the payments/remittances listed in Annex P which do not have proofs of payment.



8)	ISU Roxas and ISU Ilagan Campus Accountants are still on the process of completing the documentary deficiencies listed in Annex P. They have also committed to comply with the audit recommendations.





1)	Financial reports and disbursement vouchers were not timely submitted, contrary to Section 7.2.1a of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I, hampering the conduct of timely review and audit of the University’s financial transactions. 



1)	Section 122 of PD 1445 otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines states that:



“Section 122. Submission of Reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions



(2)	Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.



(3)	No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be available to pay the salary or any official or employee who violates the provisions of this section, without any prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such official employee.”



2)	Moreover, COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 provides the Rules and Regulations on Settlements of Accounts. Section 7.2.1a thereof states that:



		“7.2	Responsibility of the Agency Accountant



7.2.1	The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that:



a)	the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month;”



3)	Further, Sec. 60, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies prescribes the following deadlines in the submission of reports:



Period

Statement/Report

Deadline

February 14 of the following year

COA Auditor, DBM, COA-GAS



4)	However, the Accounting and Cashier’s Offices, and other concerned officials failed to observe the above-mentioned timelines. 



5)	It is observed that Satellite Campuses do not submit Trial Balances, Financial Statements, and Supporting Schedules for their respective Campuses. Instead, they submit Journals which are the basis of the Main Campus in recording their transactions in the University’s books. After recording the financial transactions of all Campuses, the University’s Accounting Office then prepares the Consolidated Trial Balances, Financial Statements and Supporting Schedules for the University as a whole.



6)	But monitoring of the submission of the Journals and other reports being submitted by the Satellite Campuses to our office showed that, most of the time, these were submitted beyond the deadline of ten days after the end of each month. It then follows that the submission of the Main Campus of Consolidated Trial Balances, Financial Statements, and Supporting Schedules were also delayed. Based on our record, the earliest submission of Consolidated Trial Balances, Financial Statements, and Supporting Schedules from the University’s Accounting Office was behind the timeline by 5 days, while the most delayed was behind by 44 days. This practice hampers the conduct of timely review on these financial reports.



7)	Moreover, 89 disbursement vouchers aggregating to P5,056,205.60 from 2018 to December 2020, were also not yet submitted to the Audit Team (Annex Q). Submission of which have been delayed from 38 days to almost three years already. 



8)	Non-submission of disbursement vouchers within the prescribed period precludes the conduct of timely post-audit to determine the validity, legality, and propriety of these financial transactions. Moreover, the correctness of recording in the books and presentation in the financial statements cannot be verified affecting the reliability of cash, liability and other affected accounts. Further, this may result to audit disallowances of the corresponding amounts as reported in the RCI.	



9)	We recommended that Management:



a)	establish a timeline on the submission of Journals and other Reports by the Satellite Campuses to the Main Campus in order for the latter to meet the deadline of submission of Consolidated Trial Balances, Financial Statements, and Supporting Schedules to the Audit Team; and



b)	the Accountants to submit the disbursement vouchers listed in Annex Q until February 14, 2021 and succeeding reports within the prescribed period, for the timely conduct of audit, final custody and to avoid audit disallowances and suspension of payment of salaries of concerned officials.



10)	In compliance with the audit recommendations, the University Accountant submitted a proposed timeline wherein Campuses will be required to submit Journals and other reports to the University Accounting Office on or before the 5th day of the following month so that Trial Balances and Supporting Schedules will be submitted on or before the 25th day of the following month. The timeline was proposed considering the volume of financial transactions and journals to be posted. Also, submission of other financial reports to other oversight agencies such as DBM and BIR also falls on the 10th day of every month.



11)	As of this writing, the 89 disbursement vouchers aggregating to  P5,056,205.60 were not yet submitted to the Audit Team. Notices of Suspension were issued to demand the submission of these disbursement vouchers.





1)	Copies of Contract together with the supporting documents for various infrastructure projects and procurement of goods and services were not submitted within five (5) working days from execution and issuance thereof, contrary to COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, preventing   the Audit Team from conducting timely auditorial review/evaluation.

 

1)	Paragraph 3.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 provides that: “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.”



2)	Paragraph 3.1.4 of the same Circular also mandates that: “Auditor shall review the, contract within a period ranging from five (5) to twenty (20) working days from receipt depending on the complexity of the contract.  The auditorial review shall consist of the evaluation of compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements, and an initial evaluation that the contractual covenants are not disadvantageous to the government.  Without waiting for the lapse of the period herein established, the Auditor concerned shall call the immediate attention of Management regarding defects and deficiencies noted in the contract, and suggest such corrective measures as are appropriate and warranted.”



3)	Paragraph 4.1 of the same Circular further states that: “Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of PD 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of the RA 6713.”Section 68 of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act.



4)	Inspite of the finding made by the previous Audit Team, ISU is not compliant to the submission within the prescribed time of the perfected contracts on infrastructure, procurement of goods and services and its supporting papers. These shall include but not limited to the following:



a)	Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid;

b)	Letter of Intent;

c)	Eligibility Documents and Eligibility Data Sheet

d)	Eligibility Requirements;

e)	Results of Eligibility Check/Screening;

f)	Bidding Documents;

g)	Minutes of Pre-bid Conference, if applicable;

h)	Agenda and/or Supplemental Bid Bulletins, if any;

i)	Bidders Technical and Financial Proposals;

j)	Minutes of Bid Opening;

k)	Abstract of Bids;

t)	Certificate of Availability of Funds, Obligation Request;

u)	Notice to Proceed; 

v)	Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof.

(Annexes A to I of COA Circular 2009-001)



5)	Although most of these documents are provided to the Audit Team upon our request to the Concerned Offices, or attached to the Disbursement Vouchers upon payment of mobilization fee or progress/final billing, the timely review and evaluation could not be performed to address early discovery and rescission of disadvantageous contracts that may have been entered into by the Agency.



6)	We recommended that Management require the concerned officials to submit copy of contracts together its supporting documents to COA in accordance with the timeline set in COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 to facilitate the review and evaluation process and attention is also invited to the penalty clause provision of said Circular.



7)	ISU Jones and Cauayan Campuses committed to comply with the audit recommendations.



8)	ISU San Mariano Campus submitted the contracts and supporting documents for the project entitled: Construction of Hostel.



9)	ISU Echague Campus apologized for the non-compliance with the regulation and assured the Audit Team of their compliance to the audit recommendations starting CY 2021.



10)	ISU Cabagan Procurement Officer informed the Audit Team that the reproduction of documents for submission to the COA Office are now in process.





A)	Compliance with Republic Act 9679



1)	Pag-IBIG premium contributions and loan amortizations deducted from the salaries of officers and employees of the University were remitted to Pag-IBIG within the prescribed period in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 9679, known as the HDMF Law of 2009. However, prior years’ withheld premiums/loan amortizations amounting to P945,534.31 remain unremitted as of December 31, 2020 due to improper monitoring of balances.

		

1)	Republic Act (RA) No. 9679, known as the HDMF Law of 2009, otherwise known as the Pag-IBIG Fund, is established in consonance with the State Policy of developing, promoting, and integrating a nationwide sound and viable tax-exempt mutual provident savings system suitable to the needs of the employed and other earning groups, and to motivate them to better plan and provide for their housing needs, by membership in the HDMF, with mandatory contributory support of the employers in the spirit of social justice and the pursuit of national development. 



2)	Moreover, Section 3, Rule VII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 9679 provides that all employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter/s loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise. 



3)	Analysis on the Due to Pag-IBIG account of the University revealed an ending balance of P1,081,942.95 as of December 31, 2020, presented below:

5)	The table shows that ISU Angadanan, Echague, Jones, San Mariano, and San Mateo almost remitted intact all their withholdings during the year while the other campuses failed to fully remit their monthly withholdings regularly. Also, we have noted an abnormal (negative) balance in the Due to Pag-IBIG account of the ISU Roxas as of December 31, 2020, amounting to P8,900.35 under Internally Generated Income and Regular Agency Fund.



6)	Further analysis on the balances of the University disclosed that out of the beginning balance of P1,118,935.83, P173,401.52 was remitted and recorded during the year yielding an unremitted amount of  P945,534.31.

8)	The above entries made in the books of the University depicts the failure of the Accountants of ISU Ilagan, Cauayan, Roxas, Angadanan, and San Mariano to timely record and properly classify transactions related to the withheld and remitted Pag-IBIG premiums and loan amortizations causing confusion in the reported balances of Due to Pag-IBIG account which could eventually result in improper monitoring and non-remittance of the withheld amounts.



9)	We commended the proper remittances of withheld HDMF contributions made within the year. However, we recommended that the Management instruct the Accountants to:

				

a)				identify the list of employees with unremitted premiums/loan amortizations for the previous years and remit the said amounts to the Pag-IBIG Fund; and

			

b)				make reconciliation and prepare the necessary journal entry vouchers for adjustments, if there’s any, to reflect the correct amount of Due to Pag-IBIG account.





B)	Compliance with Republic Act 8291



2)	The University effectively granted moratorium on all loan payments of GSIS members affected by Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in compliance with GSIS Memorandum Circulars No. 015 and 019, Series of 2020. However, premium contributions and loans amounting to P2,192,675.80 remain unremitted to the GSIS as of December 31, 2020 due to the existence of prior year balance totaling P1,185,522.13, jeopardizing the privileges and benefits accorded to its member-employees.   



1)	Section 14.1 and 14.2 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 8291 also known as the “The Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997” provides that:



14.1 Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.

14.2 The government agency shall also deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of the employee the loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan, and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS.



2)	Section 5.c of RA. No. 8291 states that in the event of failure to remit the accurate/exact amount of contribution on time, or delay the remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS, penal sanctions shall be imposed upon the employer. The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS.



3)	On the other hand, pursuant to the passage of RA Republic Act No. 11469 entitled “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” and approval of GSIS Board Resolution No. 42-2020, Government Service Insurance System issued Memorandum Circular No. 015, Series of 2020 prescribing guidelines on the “Moratorium on Loan and Rental Payments of GSIS Members and Pensioners Affected by COVID-19. The moratorium shall mean deferment of payment of loan amortization due for the months of March, April and May 2020. Moreover, on October 1, 2020, GSIS issued Memorandum Circular No. 019, Series of 2020 pertaining to Bayanihan 2 Loan Moratorium Program on All Loan Payments of GSIS Members and Pensioners Affected by Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). The new loan moratorium shall mean deferment of payment of loan amortization for another sixty (60) days or for due months November and December 2020. 



4)		Review of the general payrolls for the year 2020 disclosed that the University effectively implemented the granting a total of five (5) month moratorium on all loan payments to all its qualified employees. 



5)	The Schedule of withheld and remitted/refunded GSIS contributions and loans showed a beginning balance in the Due to GSIS account amounting to P1,540,798.63 which was carried over from the previous year, yielding to an ending balance of P2,192,675.80, details as follows:

10)	Review of the subsidiary ledgers of disclosed that some campuses failed to remit intact the premiums and loan payments deducted from the employees resulting in the accumulation of balances and eventually non-monitoring of unremitted balances of due to GSIS. It shall be noted that premiums and loan payments be timely remitted to avoid penalties and surcharges and to ensure that employees are not being prejudiced on the availment of privileges and benefits as GSIS member.



11)	We recommended that the Management:



a)	strictly adhere to the provisions of RA No. 8291 to ensure timely remittance of contributions; 



b)	implement measures to properly address the concerns regarding late remittance of contributions; 



c)	instruct the respective Campus Accountants/ Agency Authorize Officers to exert effort to trace back outstanding premiums  withheld for the previous years and prepare the necessary remittance advice and to eventually remit the said amount to the GSIS; and



d)	require the Accountant, in coordination with the ERF Handler, to remit promptly and intact all the GSIS deductions and make the necessary reconciliation, monitoring and adjustment as needed.









C)	Gender and Development

2)	PCW Memorandum Circular 2020-03 dated 27 April 2020 provides the guidelines on the Adjustment and/or Implementation of the FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget in view of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation.



3)	The Financial Statements of ISU showed Subsidy from National Government of P1,003,787,405.40, distributed/released to Campuses. At least 5% of this amount should have been attributed to the PPAs to address the gender issues and concerns identified in the GPB of the University. 



4)	Each Campus has established GAD Focal Point System with designated Focal Persons who is expected to advocate, guide, coordinate, and monitor the development, implementation, review and updating of their GAD plans and GAD-related programs, activities and projects (PAPs).  Table below presents the received allotment of each Campuses and the corresponding computed 5% GAD Fund that could have been used for GAD PPAs.

5)	However, audit of GADPB and Accomplishments Reports showed unimplemented and discontinued PPAs, and the reasons indicated therein is due to the effect of the Pandemic. Consequently, the allocated amount to implement planned PPAs was not utilized for that purpose.



6)	Given the effect of the Pandemic on the implementation of PPAs, the PCW issued Memorandum Circular 2020-03 dated 27 April 2020 providing guidelines on the Adjustment and/or Implementation of the FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget in view of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation.



7)	ISU Focal Persons did not consider this Memorandum Circular and made no revisions to the original GADPB that was formulated before the Pandemic which involved PPAs that are impossible to implement due to health and safety measures and/or quarantine that limit the movement of stakeholders.    



8)	The law requires that 5% of the general appropriation be utilized for programs and projects related to GAD, and this National Emergency is not a justification to neglect this law. Besides, PCW was responsive to this situation that they require adjustments or implementation of PPAs to consider Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation which was not acted upon by ISU GAD Focal Persons. Knowingly, ISU has several major accomplishments, but theses PAPs could not be considered as attribution to the GAD Budget, unless proven using the HCDG tool.



9)	Another reasons for failure to utilized GAD Budget on PPAs responsive to identified priority gender issues and concerns is the lack of monitoring by the GAD Focal Persons on the utilization of fund, non-coordination with the Budget Officers and Planning Department.  



10)	We recommended the following:



a)	Budget Officers should communicate with the GAD Focal Persons the amount appropriated for Gender and Development, and subsequent adjustments if any, and this total amount should correspond to the GAD Accomplishment Report;



b)	It would help if the Budget Office will maintain a Registry of Obligation that pertains to the GAD Fund, and the Focal Persons to maintain record of utilization for monitoring purposes; and



c)	The GAD Focal Persons comply with the issuances of PCW, and ensure that allocated GAD fund be utilized to according to its purpose.



11)	ISU Cauayan Campus informed the Audit Team that revisions and adjustments of programs, projects and activities have been started during the Strategic Planning of the Campus in order to address gender issues and concerns related to the effects of the Pandemic caused by COVID 19. They have also assured the Audit Team that Management has already taken measures to follow and implement the recommendations.



12)	ISU Cabagan GAD Focal Person and Budget Officer vowed to comply with the audit recommendations.





1)	Identification of priority gender issues considered in the formulation of GAD Planning and Budget was not scientifically determined due to absence of institutionalized GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data.



1)	One of the essential elements in GAD Planning and Budgeting mentioned in Paragraph 4.4 of PCW/NEDA/DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 is, “Institutionalizing GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data: The agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database GAD information to include gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically produce or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, programming, and policy formulation. 



2)	The GAD Focal Persons of ISU regularly prepare the Annual GAD Plans and Budgets (GPB) and actively carried the programs, projects and activities (PPA) utilizing the allocated budget, conveyed in their GAD Accomplishment Reports.



3)	CY 2020 is understandably difficult time to implement planned PPAs due to the imposition of lockdowns and quarantines in relation to COVID – 19 Pandemic, ensuring safety of the general public. Nevertheless, while we adapt to the new normal environment, we continue to pursue and increase commitment in the attainment of gender equality to sustainable development. As such, the determination of priority gender issues to be addressed is important in the formulation of GAD Plans and Budget.



4)	In the absence of institutionalized GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated data, identification of gender issues and measurement of success is less certain.  The identified gender issues in the GPB of the University is admittedly derived from testimonies only, as such, the accomplishments could not also be reliably measured.  But, with the integration of GAD Database/Sex disaggregated Data, gender issues and concerns to be addressed is more likely to be précised and the amount of  P50,189,020.29 or 5%  of the 2020 GAA could have been wisely utilized for the purpose it was intended.



5)	We recommended that Management through the GAD Focal Persons, to institutionalize GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data in compliance with the above-mentioned guidelines and that the formulated GAD Plans and Budget should have been based from the result of gender analysis of collected data.



6)	The University President explained that the advent of the pandemic limits the opportunity to conduct a face to face workshop on the designing and development of sex and gender disaggregated data databases, hence, such activity was carried over to the 2021 GAD Plans and Budget. He further stated that in order to ensure that SDD and GDD is institutionalized in the University, the Fiscal Year 2021 has been calendared with series of activities that aim to implement SDD and GDD and assured that the GAD Unit, together with the MIS/Planning, Office of Student Affairs, Registrar's Office and Human Resource Department are committed to implement the recommendations. 



7)	ISU San Mateo, Cabagan and Jones Campuses assured their compliance with the audit recommendations.
