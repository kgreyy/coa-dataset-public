The Executive Officers of CSU are headed by the University President, who is assisted by three (3) Vice-Presidents and a University Secretary, while the Campuses are governed by its Campus Executive Officers.

	D.         Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements 



We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the Agency.

.

	E.         Significant Findings and Recommendations



1)	Bank reconciliation statements were not prepared for Cash in Bank presented in the Financial Statements of the University totaling P2,814,323.74, thus the accuracy and existence of the said account could not be relied upon.

	

	We recommended that Management exert extra efforts to reconcile the Cash in Bank balance of P2,814,323.74. The personnel who have knowledge of the previous transactions on the subject bank accounts should be involved in the reconciliation process.



2)	The University’s Due to NGAs account balance could not be relied upon due to unreconciled balances against the records of the Source Agencies totaling P40,886,456.25, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445.



We recommended that the Accountants of the University undertake reconciliation with the Accountant of the Source Agencies for all funds received to determine the amount still due for liquidation. Likewise, strictly adhere to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 relative to the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing Agencies.



3)	Fund transfers from Other National Government Agencies with eight (8) completed projects totaling P12,093,432.42 and 47 inactive accounts for more than a year totaling P20,549,278 remained unliquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013, thus, exposed the funds to possible misappropriation or misapplication. Further, accumulated unexpended balances of P789,625.38 for completed projects and P7,038,239.92 for inactive accounts have remained in the bank accounts of the University, depriving the NGAs of funds that could have been used for other beneficial undertaking.



We recommended that Management ensure strict compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013, particularly on the submission of the Report of Checks Issued and the Report of Disbursement to the Source Agencies to report the utilization of the funds after the project completion.



4)	The Management failed to enforce the COA Orders of Execution (COEs) totaling P53,133,947.63 issued by the Regional Director of COA Regional Office No. II, which is not in accord with COA Circular No. 2009-006, hence, the persons responsible for the implementation of the COEs may be held liable. Further, the installment payments on Notices of Disallowance subject of the COEs totaling P25,626,549.15 were not in accordance with COA Resolution No. 2017-021.



We recommended that Management enforce the settlement of disallowances covered by the COEs to avoid:



	a)	disallowance in audit of all payments of salaries or any money due from the persons liable in the Notices of Disallowance and hold the Head of Agency and Cashier liable; and 



	b)	referral to the proper authority for appropriate action.

	

Also, we recommended that Management strictly adhere to the procedures provided in COA Resolution No. 2017-021, should they opt to pay in installment.   



5)	The courses of 114 new student-grantees of the Cagayan State University who are qualified beneficiaries under the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)-Scholarship Programs were not among the recognized priority courses enumerated under CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 05 Series of 2019, thus, their eligibility to avail of the Scholarship Program is questionable.



We requested that Management communicate to the CHED the aforementioned audit observations, including the following recommendations:



a)	Strictly comply with the provisions of CMO No. 05 S. 2019 in the selection of scholarship grantees to avoid the incurrence of irregular expenditures; 



b)	Review the masterlist of scholarship programs to identify those enrolled in non-recognized priority programs and make the appropriate action thereon; and 



c)	Require the scholars to observe strictly the provisions of Section 16 of CMO No 08, S. 2019 to avoid termination of their scholarship.





F. 	Gender and Development



	The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) of the University for CY 2020 has been reviewed and endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW).



G. 	Compliance with Tax Laws



Audit observations were discussed in detail in Part II of this Report.



H. 	Status of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges as at year end
