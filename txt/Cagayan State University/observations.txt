PART II – DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial and Compliance Audit



Non-preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements - P2,814,323.74



1)	Bank reconciliation statements were not prepared for Cash in Bank presented in the Financial Statements of the University totaling P2,814,323.74, thus, the accuracy and existence of the said account could not be relied upon.



	1)	Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) I and Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provide that: “Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs.”



	2)	Review of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) submitted showed that BRS were not prepared for the Cash in Bank of CSU Andrews Campus totaling P2,814,323.74. As a result, the accuracy and existence of the said amount could not be relied upon.



	3)	The breakdown of the P2,814,323.74 is as follows:

	4)	The Audit Team requested Management to confirm the Cash in Bank balances with the concerned banks. Bank confirmation letters were then sent by Management to the concerned banks. Receipts of the confirmation letters are as follows:

	5)	Based on the confirmation reply of United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB), it appears that the aforementioned account of the University with the UCPB is no longer existing because it is not included in the confirmation reply.



	6)	To date, the confirmation replies from other banks were not yet received.



	7)	We recommended that Management exert extra efforts to reconcile the Cash in Bank balance of P2,814,323.74. The personnel who have knowledge of the previous transactions on the subject bank accounts should be involved in the reconciliation process.



	8)	The Management commented that the balances of these bank accounts are forwarded in the books but are no longer existing in the banks. Due to unavailability of records to reconcile these accounts, the management is considering to hire the services of the former FMO, Ms. Vita Bassig. The management believes that her knowledge on the history of these bank accounts will help on the reconciliation of these accounts.



	9)	With regard to the plan to hire Ms. Vita Bassig, Management should consider the fact that the unreconciled amount may have occurred during her stint as FMO. As such, Ms. Bassig may be held accountable for the unaccounted amount.



Stale checks - P418,382.56



	2.  Outstanding checks amounting to P418,382.56 were already stale, hence, the checks can no longer be negotiated/ encashed in the bank and will remain as reconciling items in the monthly BRS unless replaced.











	1)	Section 44, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies states that: 



“Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from the date of issuance or as prescribed”.



A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows:



a)	Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI



b)	New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be reported in the RCI.”



	2)	 Verification of the monthly BRS prepared by the Campus Accounting Offices disclosed that there were various stale checks totalling P418,382.56 as at December 31, 2020, summarized as follows:

	1)	The stale checks can no longer be negotiated by the payees and will remain as reconciling items in the BRS until these checks are cancelled and replaced.  



	2)	Failure of the Accountant and/or the Cashier to take actions on stale checks rendered the accuracy of the Cash in Bank account unreliable.



	3)	We recommended that the Accountant and/or the Cashier coordinate with the payees of the checks so that the measures/actions prescribed in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I as regards stale checks would be adopted.



	4)	The Accountant of Gonzaga Campus commented that the four (4) stale checks were already replaced. The other four (4) payees were already notified regarding the other stale checks and the requirements for replacement. 



	5)	The Accounting Office of Andrews Campus forwarded a list of outstanding checks to the Cashier’s Office for them to identify which of the stale checks were already issued to the payee and which are still in their custody.



	6)	The unissued stale checks will be cancelled in accordance with the accounting for cancelled checks as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs. For the stale checks already issued to the payees, the same will be coordinated to the payees for them to submit/surrender the stale checks for cancellation and issuance of new checks as replacement.



Unliquidated cash advances - P1,328,420.55



3)	Cash advances of officers and employees totaling P1,328,420.55 remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002, which delayed the recognition of asset/expenses that were paid out of said cash advances and exposed any unused cash advances to risk of loss and/or misappropriation.  



	1)	Item 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that: “All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.”



	2)	Review of the Statement of Financial Position showed unliquidated Cash Advances of P1,328,420.55 as at December 31, 2020 broken down below:

	

	Account Title

	Amount

	Advances for Payroll

	P  202,981.29

	Advances to Special Disbursing Officer

	572,197.95

	Advance to Officers and Employees

	553,241.31

	Total

	P1,328,420.55



	3)	Advances to Payroll amounting to P202,981.29 remained unliquidated due to the failure of the payees to claim their compensation. The Cashier should exert more effort to inform the payees of their claims and set a deadline so that the cash advances will be liquidated as soon as possible.



	4)	Advances to Special Disbursing Officer amounting to P572,197.95 represents cash advances for financial assistance to students, stipend, honoraria and working capital for CSU Hotel.



	5)	Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P553,241.31 represents unliquidated cash advances granted to officers and employees for local and foreign travels.



	6)	The non-liquidation of the cash advances resulted in the understatement of expenses and overstatement of assets that were paid out of said cash advances and exposed to risk of loss and misuse any unused balance thereof.

 

3.7        We recommended that Management:

		

a)		require the immediate liquidation of all outstanding cash advances;

	

b)		withhold salaries of accountable officers who persistently fail to settle their cash advances and continue to ignore the submission of the requirements as cited in COA Circular No. 97-002; and

	

c)		refer to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 as regards the possible write-off of dormant accounts.



	1)	Management commented that Advances to Payroll and Advances to Special Disbursing Officer accounts will be liquidated as soon as possible. As regards the Advances to Officers and Employees account, demand letters were sent to those with known addresses while Certificates of Non-availability of Documents were prepared for those with unknown addresses. They are currently working on their request for write-off for these accounts.



Unreconciled Due to NGAs balance - P40,886,456.25



4)	The University’s Due to NGAs Account balance could not be relied upon due to unreconciled balances against the records of the Source Agencies totaling P40,886,456.25, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445.



	1)	Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445 requires the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency in the keeping of accounts of an agency to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



	2)	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies. This is to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of both the Source Agency (SA) and the Implementing Agency (IA) and that the transferred funds are used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds.



	3)	The account Due to NGAs pertains to funds received by the University from the different NGAs such as the Department of Agriculture (DA), Agricultural Training Institute (ATI), Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the implementation of various projects.



	4)	Verification of the subsidiary ledgers of the account Due to NGAs and the replies of the Accountants of the University to the confirmation request from the Source Agencies, namely DA, ATI, BAI, PENRO, DOST and CHED, on the outstanding balances of the funds transferred to the University showed a discrepancy between the University records and the records of the said Agencies totaling P40,886,456.25, as follows:

	5)	The details of the subject fund transfers from DA RF02, ATI-RTC2, BAI, PENRO-Cagayan, DOST R02, and CHED R02 are shown in Annexes E to J.



	6)	The differences on the balances between the books of the University and the source agencies may be attributable to the late recording of liquidation by the source agencies and/or the late submission of liquidation documents by the University.  Thus, the account Due to NGAs presented in the books could not be relied upon.



	1)	We recommended that the Accountants of the University to undertake reconciliation with the Accountant of the Source Agencies for all funds received to determine the amount still due for liquidation. Likewise, strictly adhere to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 relative to the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing Agencies.



	1)	The Management committed to adhere to the recommendation instructing Accountants of the University to reconcile with the Accountant of the Source Agencies. The unreconciled balances were due to the timing difference in the recording of the disbursements of the projects. 



Unliquidated Fund Transfers from other NGAs – P32,642,710.42



1)	Fund transfers from Other National Government Agencies (NGAs) with eight (8) completed projects totaling P12,093,432.42 and 47 inactive accounts for more than a year totaling P20,549,278.00 remained unliquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013, thus, exposed the funds to possible misappropriation or misapplication. Further, accumulated unexpended balances of P789,625.38 for completed projects and P7,038,239.92 for inactive accounts have remained in the bank accounts of the University, depriving the NGAs of funds that could have been used for other beneficial undertaking.



	1)	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides for the Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds transferred to Implementing Agencies. It provides among others that within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the Implementing Agency shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.



	2)	Review of the funds received by the University from various National Government Agencies as at October 31, 2020 disclosed that there were eight (8) completed projects totaling P12,093,432.42 which remained unliquidated despite completion of these projects. While there were 47 projects totaling P20,549,278.96 which remained inactive/non–moving for more than a year. These are contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013, thus, exposed the funds to possible misappropriation or misapplication. 



	3)	Further review disclosed that, accumulated unexpended balances of P789,625.38 for completed projects and P7,038,239.92 for inactive accounts have remained in the bank accounts of the University, depriving the NGAs of funds that could have been used for other beneficial undertaking. Also, the non-liquidation of unused funds when the purposes thereof have already been attained, resulted in the unnecessary and prolonged recognition of liability of the said amount. Details are as follows:

Courses of student-grantees not among the CHED recognized priority courses



3)	The courses of 114 new student-grantees of the Cagayan State University who are qualified beneficiaries under the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)-Scholarship Programs were not among the recognized priority courses enumerated under CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 05 Series of 2019, thus, their eligibility to avail of the Scholarship Program is questionable.



	1)		CMO No. 05 Series of 2019 re: Priority Courses for CHED Scholarships Programs (CSPs) for Academic Year 2019-2020 was issued pursuant to CHED en Banc (CEB) Resolution No. 264-2019 dated April 30, 2019 in relation to Section 8 (i) and (n) of Republic Act No. 7722, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Act of 1994” and the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2019 under Special Provisions stating that “CHED shall likewise prioritize courses aligned with global innovation platforms of Science, Technology, Engineering, Agri-fisheries and Mathematics (STEAM) as well as the priorities of the government in key growth areas, such as semiconductor and electronics, business process outsourcing, tourism, general infrastructure and other priority manufacturing industries in the grant of scholarships”.

	4)	Section 15 of the CMO No. 08, Series of 2019 enumerates the responsibilities of a scholars, which include the following:



1)	Enroll in recognized priority programs of Private Higher Education Institutions (PHEIs) or SUCs/ LUCs with COPs; and

2)	Secure written approval of the concerned CHEDRO in case of transfer to another HEI or in case of shift to other recognized and authorized priority programs. 



	5)	Furthermore, Section 16 of the same CMO provides the rules on deferment, replacement and termination, which states, among others, that a scholarship may be terminated on the ground of enrollment in non-recognized or non-priority programs. 



	6)	Review of the Masterlist of CHED Scholarship Programs in every campus disclosed that there are 114 new scholar-beneficiaries (Annex L) selected and allowed by CHED to enroll in non-recognized priority courses for the AY 2019-2020.  



	7)	The total financial assistance granted to the said scholars totaled P855,000.00 per semester, summarized as follows:

	8)	Further review and comparison of the said CHED Masterlist and the Summary of Enrollment for First Years 2019-2020 provided by the Office of the University Registrar showed that, of the 114 scholar-beneficiaries, 19 enrolled a different course.  It was, however, noted that most of the enrolled courses were not also among the identified priority courses.



	9)	With the grant of scholarship to the aforementioned grantees, the CHED failed to comply with its own Circular.  Moreover, the purpose of identifying priority courses for its scholarship programs was not achieved.  This also resulted in the incurrence of irregular expenditures.



	10)	We requested that Management communicate to the CHED the aforementioned audit observations, including the following recommendations:



a)	Strictly comply with the provisions of CMO No. 05 S. 2019 in the selection of scholarship grantees to avoid the incurrence of irregular expenditures; 



b)	Review the masterlist of scholarship programs to identify those enrolled in non-recognized priority programs and make the appropriate action thereon; and 



c)	Require the scholars to observe strictly the provisions of Section 16 of CMO No 08, S. 2019 to avoid termination of their scholarship.



	11)	Management informed the Audit Team that the masterlist from CHED is the main document used by CSU as basis of the Office of the Student Development and Welfare in the preparation of payroll of the grantees. Hence, the University is not involved in the identification of students included in the CHED Scholarship Programs. They recommended that a copy of the Audit Observation Memorandum be officially sent by the Audit Team to the CHED for appropriate action.



	12)	The audit observation cannot be directly communicated by the Audit Team to CHED because the Agency is not their auditee. Nonetheless, the observation was communicated to the concerned Auditor.



Hiring of private lawyer without first securing written conformity from the OSG and written concurrence from the COA



4)	The University engaged the legal services of a private lawyer without securing first the written conformity or acquiescence of the Solicitor General, and the written concurrence of the Commission on Audit (COA) contrary to COA Circular No. 86-255, as amended by COA Circular No. 95-011, thus, resulting in the incurrence of irregular expenditures amounting to P119,000.00.



	1)	COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 04, 1995 states that: “Public Funds shall not be utilized for payment of the services of a private legal counsel or law firm to represent government agencies in court or to render legal services for them.  In the event that such legal services cannot be avoided or is justified under extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, the written conformity or acquiescence of the Solicitor General or Corporate Government Counsel, as the case may be, and the written concurrence of the COA shall first be secured before the hiring or employment of a private lawyer or law firm.”



	2)	Review of disbursement vouchers and its supporting documents disclosed that a Professional Service Contract notarized on May 22, 2020 was entered into by and between the Cagayan State University (CSU), represented by Urdujah A. Tejada, University President, and Atty. Minehaha Liggayo Espejo, whereby the latter shall act as Adviser and shall perform under the following terms and conditions, viz:



1)	Render advice when requested to the University President as well as to the University Officials on the drafting of contracts and agreements;

2)	Assist university officials in disputes, contests, challenges in respect to the performance of their official duties;

3)	Write legal opinions for the benefit of the administration of the Cagayan State University when such opinions are requested;

4)	Prepare position papers, memoranda, and other documents that may be required for the protection of the university officials in matters related to the discharge of their official duties; 

5)	Render such other services as may be requested of her by the University consistent with her specialization and expertise;

6)	The Adviser shall receive the amount of Thirty Five Thousand Pesos (P35,000.00) per month, payable at the end of each month; 

7)	Payment shall be made in accordance with Accounting and Auditing rules and regulations for the payment of persons serving under contracts of service, including the accomplishment of all necessary forms and reports; and

8)	The contract shall be in effect for the period covering January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020 subject to pre-termination by the University President after due notification to the Adviser at least one (1) month prior to pre-termination, unless the parties shall agree on a shorter period.



	1)		Further review of documents disclosed that it was only on June 1, 2020 that the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) granted the deputation of Atty. Minehaha Liggayo Espejo as special attorney of CSU. The deputation states that the authority is valid from May 14, 2020 to December 31, 2020, unless revoked by the OSG. While, on October 19, 2020, the COA gave its concurrence to the said Professional Service Contract for the period May 14, 2020 to December 31, 2020, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations stated therein.

	

	2)		Since the authority granted and the concurrence given by the OSG and the COA, respectively, is valid only for the period May 14, 2020 to December 31, 2020, the payments to Atty. Espejo for the services rendered from January 2020 to April 2020 amounting to P119,000.00 is considered as irregular expenditures. The details of the payment are shown as follows:

	3)	We recommended that Management strictly observe the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 86-255, as amended by COA Circular No. 95-011 in the hiring of private lawyers to avoid incurrence of irregular expenditures. Moreover, it is recommended that the officials and employees involved in the hiring of Atty. Espejo, without first complying the requirements set, be required to refund the amount of P119,000.00.  



	4)	Management commented that Atty. Minehaha Espejo commenced her services to the University upon the effectivity of her contract. The written conformity was issued later by the Solicitor General and the Commission on Audit, but Management believes that the payment for her services should commence from the date she actually rendered her services to the University in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract entered into by her and Cagayan State University.



	5)	It is reiterated that the written conformity or acquiescence of the Solicitor General, and the written concurrence of the Commission on Audit   must first be secured before hiring a private lawyer.



Payment of professional fee higher than the amount determined by COA as reasonable



5)	The professional fee paid for the legal services of a private lawyer was more than the amount determined as reasonable by the Commission on Audit in the conduct of Legal Retainer Review, resulting in the incurrence of excessive expenditures amounting to P75,000.00.



	1)	COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 04, 1995 states that “Public Funds shall not be utilized for payment of the services of a private legal counsel or law firm to represent government agencies in court or to render legal services for them.  In the event that such legal services cannot be avoided or is justified under extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, the written conformity or acquiescence of the Solicitor General or Corporate Government Counsel, as the case may be, and the written concurrence of the COA shall first be secured before the hiring or employment of a private lawyer or law firm.”



	2)	On October 19, 2020, the COA concurred in the Professional Service Contract entered into by and between the CSU represented by its President, Dr. Urdujah A. Tejada, and Atty. Minehaha Liggayo Espejo, for the latter to act as legal adviser of CSU for the period May 14, 2020 to December 31, 2020. However, the said concurrence provides, among others, that Atty. Espejo’s professional fee shall be reduced from P35,000.00 to P20,000.00 per month, the amount determined as reasonable by the Commission under Legal Retainer Review No. 2019-061 dated May 21, 2019 for similar contracts in Tuguegarao City.



	3)	Review of the disbursement vouchers pertaining to the payment of the legal services of Atty. Espejo for the months of May 2020 to September 2020 disclosed that she was paid a professional fee of P35,000.00 per month, which is higher by P15,000.00 than the  amount determined as reasonable by COA, resulting in the incurrence of excessive expenditures in the amount of  P75,000.00. Excessive expenditures is defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, quoted as follows:



“The term “excessive expenditures” signifies unreasonable expense or expenses incurred in an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price. It also include expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses in excess of reasonable limits.”



	4)	We recommended that Management require Atty. Espejo to refund the amount of P75,000.00 which is considered as an excessive expenditure. Otherwise, the concerned officials and employees may be held liable for the said amount. 



	5)	Management believes that the Contract entered into by Cagayan State University and Atty. Espejo should be the law between the parties. Her fee under the contract was determined to be reasonable by Management considering the nature of the services required of Atty. Espejo.



	6)	It is reiterated that the written conformity or acquiescence of the Solicitor General, and the written concurrence of the Commission on Audit   must first be secured before hiring a private lawyer. 



	7)	Before it concurs in the Retainership Contract, the Commission on Audit determine, among others, the reasonableness of the professional fee to be paid to the private lawyer. The amount determined as reasonable by the Commission on Audit shall be the professional fee to be paid to the retainer lawyer. 



Non-enforcement of COA Orders of Execution 



6)	The Management failed to enforce the COA Orders of Execution (COEs) totaling P53,133,947.63 issued by the Regional Director of COA Regional Office No. II, which is not in accord with COA Circular No. 2009-006, hence, the persons responsible for the implementation of the COEs may be held liable. Further, the installment payments on Notices of Disallowance (NDs) subject of the COEs totaling P25,626,549.15 were not in accordance with COA Resolution No. 2017-021.



	1)	Section 7 of the Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 states, among others, the responsibility of the Agency Head as follows:



7.1. Responsibility of the Agency Head



		1)			The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his/her agency, shall ensure that (a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM.

		

		2)			The head of the Agency shall initiate the necessary    administrative and/or criminal action in case of unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with the foregoing requirements by subordinate officials. Gross negligence in disciplining subordinates who are the subject of repeated adverse audit findings shall subject the officials concerned to disciplinary action by the proper authorities as the evidence may warrant.

2)	

	1)	

		3)	He shall enforce the COA Order of Execution (COE) by requiring the withholding of salaries or other compensation due the person liable in satisfaction of the disallowance or charge. (underscoring ours)



		4)	He shall ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable.



	2)	The Regional Director of COA Regional Office No. II issued the following COEs to CSU for NDs totaling P78,760,496.78 that became final and executory:

	3)	The COE is a written instruction to withhold payment of salary and other money due to the persons liable for the settlement of their liability. In the COEs, the Head of Agency and the Cashier were reminded that payment of salaries or any money due the persons liable in violation of the instruction will be disallowed in audit and they shall be held liable thereof.



	4)	In the monitoring of the enforcement of COEs, it was noted that management did not implement the orders for NDs totaling P53,133,947.63 that became final and executory. Further, although installment payments of P1,658,256.96 were made on NDs totaling P25,626,549.15, these were not in accordance with COA Resolution No. 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017. The details of the settlements made are shown in Annex M.



	5)	Under the said COA Resolution, requests for installment payment may be made directly by the persons liable to settle their liabilities. For audit disallowances involving several persons liable, the head of the agency or its authorized official may request installment payment in their behalf, provided that a written authority is issued by the persons liable and attached to the request. Only those persons liable with written authority shall be allowed to settle their liability in installment. 



	6)	Moreover, the COA Resolution states that all request for installment payment shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Prosecution and Litigation Office (PLO), Legal Service Sector (LSS), through the concerned Auditors and Cluster/Regional Directors, with appropriate comment, recommendation, proposed installment, schedule, and supporting documents.



	7)	As a matter of procedure, if these COEs were disregarded and ignored, the COA shall disallow in audit all payment of salaries or any money due from the persons liable and hold the Head of Agency and the Cashier liable thereof. In addition, for the non-settlement of COEs, COA shall refer the matter to the General Counsel for appropriate action including referral to the Office of the Solicitor General and the Ombudsman.



	8)	We recommended that Management enforce the settlement of disallowances covered by the COEs to avoid:



	a)	disallowance in audit of all payments of salaries or any money due from the persons liable in the Notices of Disallowance and hold the Head of Agency and Cashier liable; and 



	b)	referral to the proper authority for appropriate action.



	9)	Also, we recommended that Management strictly adhere to the procedures provided in COA Resolution No. 2017-021, should they opt to pay in installment.



	10)	The Management will make a request for installment payment of the disallowances covered by the COA Orders of Execution. The management is considering the idea of having consolidated request for the entire university, if possible. 



	11)	It is advised that Management strictly follow the provisions of COA Resolution No. 2017-021 as regards to the request for installment payment of the disallowances covered by the COA Orders of Execution.



Non-remittance of excess collections from the sale of bid documents - P933,489.88



1)	The balance of collections from the sale of bid documents and fees of CSU-Andrews Campus amounting to P933,489.88 was not remitted to the Bureau of Treasury, contrary to item 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A. 



	1)	Item 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A states “Pursuant to the DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Resolution No. 2005-2 dated June 2005, all agencies are authorized to treat the collections from the sources identified in item 6.1 hereof as trust receipts to be used exclusively for the payment of honoraria and overtime pay herein authorized. … Any excess in the amount collected shall be remitted by NGAs to the Bureau of Treasury.”



	2)	Item 6.1.of the said Circular provides that “the amount necessary for the payment of the honoraria and overtime pay shall be sourced only from the following:

		--	Proceeds from sale of bid documents;

		--	Fees from contractor/supplier registry;

		--	Fees charged for copies of minutes of bid openings, BAC resolutions and other BAC documents;

		--	Protest Fees

		--		Liquidated damages; and

		--	Proceeds from bid/performance security forfeiture.”



	3)	Verification of financial reports of the CSU-Andrews Campus revealed that the proceeds from the sale of bid documents has a year-end balance of P933,489.88. Said amount was not remitted to the Bureau of Treasury contrary to the afore-cited regulation.  The balance includes the unremitted year-end balance in 2019 amounting to P827,604.88. 



	4)	Inquiry with the University Accountant revealed that there are no pending claims for honoraria, thus, the whole amount of P933,489.88 should be remitted to the Bureau of Treasury.



	5)	We recommended that the University Accountant/Cashier remit the amount of P933,489.88  to the Bureau of Treasury pursuant to Item 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A.



	6)	Management commented that said balance of collections from the sale of bid documents and fees will be used to cover the honorarium of BAC members to be paid upon completion of the two (2) on-going procur ement projects. Any excess or any unutilized balance will be remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury.



Lacking documents on assistance to scholars

 

			1)	The grant of assistance to scholars totaling P43,556.00 was not supported by complete documentation, which is not in accordance with Section 6 of Cagayan State University Administrative Manual 2017, thus, the legality and propriety of the grant could not be determined.



	1)	Section 6 of Cagayan State University Administrative Manual 2017, which provides the Faculty Development Program Policies Guidelines for the granting of Scholars, requires, among others, the following documents:



a)	Scholarship Committee Approval;

b)	Scholarship Grant Approved by the University President; and

c)	Memorandum of Agreement /Scholarship Contract



	2)	Post audit of disbursement vouchers disclosed that payments were made for the plane/air fare of two (2) Institutional Scholars amounting to P43,556.00 without the aforementioned documents. Moreover, it was observed that the payment was not supported with the necessary Travel Order. The details of the payment are shown as follows:

	3)	The aforementioned documents are necessary to support the legality and propriety of the grant of assistance to the scholars and to prove strict observance and compliance by the University Officials to the existing guidelines on the grant of scholarships to CSU Faculty and Staff.



	4)	We recommended that Management submit the required documents to determine the legality of the grant of financial assistance to the two (2) Institutional Scholars. Non-submission of these documents may lead to the issuance of Notice of Suspension or Notice of Disallowance. 



	5)	Management commented that they will secure approval from the Board of Regents on the scholarship grants in the next Board Meeting. The documents will be submitted after the approval.



	6)	Based on the existing guidelines, scholarship grants should be approved by the University President. Such approval was not secured prior to the incurrence of the aforementioned disbursements. Hence, the grant of assistance in the form of plane fare is without legal basis.     



Grant of scholarship to contract of service employee



			2)	Financial assistance in the form of scholarship totaling P10,330.00 was granted to a contract of service employee, which is contrary to Section 3 of the Cagayan State University Faculty and Staff Development Policies and Implementing Guidelines, thus, resulting in the incurrence of irregular expenditure.



	1)	Irregular expenditures is defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, quoted as follows:



“The term “irregular expenditure” signifies an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with the prescribed usages and rule of discipline. There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular.”



	2)	Section 3 of the Cagayan State University Faculty and Staff Development Policies and Implementing Guidelines provide, among others, that the applicant for scholarship and other learning and development opportunities must occupy a regular plantilla position.



	3)	Post audit of disbursement vouchers disclosed that payments were made for the tuition fee and book allowance of a scholar whose employment with the University is under contract of service, resulting in the incurrence of irregular expenditure totaling P10,330.00. The details of the payment are shown as follows:

	4)	We recommended that Management strictly observe the pertinent provisions of Cagayan State University Faculty and Staff Development Policies and Implementing Guidelines and require Mr. Tabao to refund the amount of P10,330.00, which is considered as an irregular expenditure. 



	5)	Management commented that they will secure approval from the Board of Regents on the scholarship grant in the next Board Meeting. The documents will be submitted after the approval.



	6)	The issue in this case is the employment status of the scholar, who is hired under contract of service. He is not qualified to avail of the scholarship grant because this is open only to employees occupying regular plantilla positions.



Use of Reimbursement Expense Receipts 



			3)	Reimbursement Expense Receipts were used as evidence to support the claim of employees for purchases of goods and snacks and other expenses amounting to P150,900, thus, depriving the Government of the supposed taxes from said transactions.



	1)	Item 3.3 of COA Circular No. 2004-006 dated September 9, 2004 states, among others, that the Reimbursement Expense Receipt (RER) shall be acceptable for disbursements where the payee is not a business entity required by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to issue ORs and the money is advanced by the official concerned and the expense is authorized to be reimbursed by the government agency concerned.



	2)	Post-audit of the transactions of CSU–Sanchez Mira Campus revealed that payment for purchases of goods and snacks and other expenses totaling P150,900.00 (Annex N) were only supported by RERs as  evidence for the claims from January 2020 to November 2020. Review of the transactions showed that most of these could have been procured from BIR registered entities, hence, Official Receipts could have been issued and the supposed taxes could have been collected by the government from such transactions.



	3)	We recommended that the Campus Executive Officer advise the employees to refrain from purchasing from unregistered business establishments so that they can demand the issuance of Official Receipts, instead of RERs. Likewise, we recommend strict observance of the provisions of COA Circular No. 2004-006 as regards the use of RERs.



	4)	Management committed to comply with our audit recommendation.



B)	Compliance with Tax Laws



Delayed remittance of withholding taxes - P504,952.16



1)	Taxes withheld from employees’ compensation and from various suppliers amounting to P504,952.16 were not remitted on time, thus, depriving the government of  additional revenue/income for utilization in the implementation of various programs/projects. 



	1)	BIR Revenue Regulations No. 11-2018 and RR No. 2-98, as amended, provides the pertinent provisions relative to the withholding of income taxes on compensation while BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007 dated March 20, 2007 provides the clarifications on the computations of withholding taxes and other requirements on government money payments due or payable to suppliers of goods and/or services.



	2)	Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 provides that “the filing of return and payment of tax due should be on or before the 10th day following the month in which withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the month of December of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year”.



	3)	Section VI of BIR Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 also provides that: “The following officials are duty bound to deduct, withhold and remit taxes: For NGAs, GOCCs and other Government Offices, the Chief Accountant and the Head of Office or the Official holding the highest position (such as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Governor, General Manager).”



	4)	The penal provisions of the said Memorandum Order are provided under Section VII thereof:



“A. Failure to Collect and Remit Taxes (Section 251, NIRC) 



“Any person required to withhold, account for, and remit any tax imposed by this Code or who willfully fails to withhold such tax, or account for and remit such tax, or aids or abets in any manner to evade any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided for under this Chapter, be liable upon conviction to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax not withheld, or not accounted for and remitted.”

	7)	Non-observance of BIR regulations requiring immediate remittance of taxes withheld increased the liabilities of the University to the national government and prevented the utilization of the revenue/income for its programs and projects. Moreover, this may result in possible misappropriation or loss of cash.



	8)	We recommended that the Campus Accountants remit the taxes withheld on or before the 10th day of the month following the month of withholding, except for taxes withheld for the month of December which shall be filed/remitted on or before the 15th day of the month of the succeeding year, pursuant to pertinent Revenue Regulations. Furthermore, ensure that penalties due to late remittance shall be borne by the responsible officials of the campus and not by the government.



	9)	Management informed the Audit Team that most of the balance does not need to be remitted because they were only due to errors in recording. They have already started cleaning up the account and hope to complete it within the year.



Non-withholding of taxes from regular suppliers on purchases amounting to P10,000.00 and below



2)	The management failed to withhold taxes from regular suppliers for purchases amounting to P10,000.00 and below, which is contrary to Section 2.57.2 of BIR Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 and Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2012, thus, resulting in the non-collection of the supposed taxes from purchases of goods and services with an aggregate amount of P395,825.73.



	1)	Section 2.57.2 of BIR Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 dated March 15-2018 provides the income payments subject to creditable withholding tax and the rates prescribed thereon. Section 2.57.2(J) of the said regulation states  “Income payments, except any single purchase which is P10,000 and below, which are made by a government office, national or local, including barangays, or their attached agencies or bodies, and government-owned or controlled corporations, on their purchases of goods and purchases of services from local/resident suppliers: 



Supplier of goods – One percent (1%) 

Supplier of services – Two percent (2%).”



	2)	Sec 2.57.2 (I) of the same Revenue Regulation provides, among others, that “The term “local resident supplier of goods/services” pertains to a supplier from whom any of the top withholding agents, regularly makes its purchases of goods/services. As a general rule, this term does not include casual purchases made from a non-regular supplier and oftentimes involving a single purchase. However, a single purchase which involves Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) or more shall be subject to withholding tax under this subsection. The term “regular suppliers”, for purposes of these regulations, refers to suppliers who are engaged in business or exercise of profession/calling with whom the taxpayer-buyer has transacted at least (6) transactions, regardless of amount per transaction, either in the previous year or current year.”



	3)	Moreover, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2012 - reiteration of the responsibilities of the Officials and Employees of Government Offices for the withholding of Applicable Taxes on certain Income Payments and the Imposition of Penalties for Non-Compliance Thereof provides, among others:



B. Responsibilities of the Government Official /Employees as withholding agents. 



Xxx



3. To withhold the correct amount of tax. Based on the office’s registration and where applicable, the government withholding agent should withhold tax on compensation, on income payments subject to Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT) and Final Withholding Tax (FWT) and on government money payments to VAT registered taxpayers and non-VAT registered taxpayers subject to Percentage Tax pursuant to Section 80 (A), 57 and 114, all of the Tax Code. 

Xxx



C. Applicable Penalties for Specific Violations



Xxx.



1)	Non-withholding of tax 

a)	Collection of the amount the withholding agent failed to withhold (Sec 251, Tax Code)

b)	

c)	20% interest (Sec249, tax Code

	4)	It was observed in the audit of the transactions of CSU-Gonzaga Campus that management failed to withhold taxes on payments to suppliers and service providers for transactions amounting to P10,000 and below. The subject transactions totaling P395,825.73 (Annex P) include, among others, payments to PLDT, gasoline stations and suppliers of construction and electrical supplies. This resulted in the non-collection of the supposed taxes from the said transactions.



	5)	The Campus Accountant explained that it has been their practice not to withhold taxes on transactions involving the said amount. 



	6)	It is emphasized that the non-withholding of taxes applies only to any single purchase of P10,000 and below. The suppliers for the subject transactions are considered as their regular suppliers since they transacted with them for six (6) times or more (Annex Q).  Hence, the purchases should have been subject to withholding tax pursuant to the afore-cited provisions of BIR Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018.



	7)	We recommended that the Accountant withhold the appropriate taxes upon payment to suppliers for purchases of goods and services to avoid the imposition of penalties on the government official who failed to follow BIR rules and regulations.



	8)	Management assured the Audit Team that they will comply with the audit recommendation.



C)	Remittance of GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions



Delayed remittance of GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG  Premium Contributions 



3)	Statutory monthly contributions to GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG amounting to P4,438,112.19, P128,716.20, and P538,599.69, respectively, were not remitted on time by the University to the concerned agency/corporation, contrary to Republic Act (R.A.) Nos. 8291, 7875 and 7742, respectively.



	1)	Section 6 of R.A. No. 8291 (GSIS Act) provides that: “Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wage of its employees.”



	2)	Section 20 of Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of the National Health Insurance Act of 1995 (RA No. 7875 as amended by RA No. 9241) states that: “The monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before the tenth (10th) calendar day of the month following the applicable month for which the payment is due and applicable.”



	3)	Section 5, Rule VI of the Implementing Rules and Regulation of R.A. No. 7742 (an Act amending PD 1752, known as the Pag-IBIG Fund Law) provides that: “Remittance of Collections -  All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions as well as the contributions of their covered employees including those employees who, in proper instances, voluntarily join the Fund within fifteen (15) days from the date the contributions were collected unless other period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund. Xxx.”



	4)	Verification of the accounts of the University disclosed unremitted statutory contributions to the GSIS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG, which may deprive the concerned agencies of the timely use of the funds due to them. Moreover, this may result in possible misappropriation or loss of cash.



	5)	The books of accounts of Andrews, Carig, Gonzaga, Lasam, Sanchez Mira and Piat Campuses disclosed unremitted Statutory monthly contributions totaling P5,384,106.48 as at December 31, 2020:
