EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 

 

The National Library of the Philippines (NLP) was established as the Museo-

Biblioteca de Filipinas through the royal decree of August 12, 1887. The Library was 

revived with the donation made by the American Circulating Library Association of 

its “Circulating Library” to the government formalized through Public Act No. 96 

passed on March 5, 1901. 

In 1916, The Philippine Library, Division of Archives, Patents, Copyrights and 

Trademarks of the Executive Bureau, and the Law Library of the Philippine assembly 

were merged into one entity, called the Philippine Library and Museum. Twelve 

years later, the Philippine Legislature separated the museum from the library. Public 

Law No. 3477 (1928) established the National Museum under the Department of 

Agriculture and Natural Resources and changed the name of the Philippine Library and 

Museum to The National Library. 

 The President of the Philippines changed the name of The National Library to 

Bureau of Public Libraries in accordance with Executive Order (EO) No. 94, series 

1947. This order was followed by Republic Act (RA) No. 411, otherwise known as the 

Municipal Libraries Law, authored by the then Senator Geronima T. Pecson. RA No. 

3873 passed in 1964 brought back to the Bureau of Public Libraries its old name, The 

National Library. Currently, the library is known as the NLP pursuant to RA No. 10087 

enacted in May 13, 2010. 

It is under the supervision of the National Commission for Culture and the 

Arts (NCCA). 

The NLP functions as the national repository of printed and recorded cultural 

heritage and other intellectual, literacy and information sources. Its main objectives 

are: a) to acquire and preserve all Filipiniana materials; b) to provide information, 

reference and research resources to the public; c) to develop, in cooperation with the 

local government units, a system of public libraries and information centers 

throughout the country;  d) to provide national bibliographic services and 

information network; e) to  provide special services to  the visually handicapped; and 

f) to promote, establish and maintain national and international standards in library 

and information services. 

It is headed by a Director who is assisted by an Assistant Director and nine 

Division Chiefs.  

As of December  31,  2020,  the  NLP  had  a  total  workforce  of   193 
consisting of 119 permanent, 72  job order personnel and two consultants.

D. Scope of Audit 

 

The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be 

placed on the Management's assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, 

rules and regulations; c) recommend agency's improvement opportunities; and d) 

determine the extent of implementation of prior year's audit recommendations. 

Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of 

Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor's Report on the Financial Statements 

 

The auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation 

of the Financial Statements (FSs) of NLP as at December 31, 2020 due to the 

following observations: 

 

1. The balance of the Cash-Collecting Officer (CO) account of ₱4,354.13 as of 
December 31, 2020 is understated due to erroneous recording of collections 

totaling ₱13,239.01 as deposited but were actually on-hand as of year-end; hence, 

overstating the accounts Cash, Treasury/Agency Deposits, Regular by ₱2,239.01 

and the Cash in Bank, Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) by ₱11,000.00. 

(Paragraph No. 1) 

 

2. The balance of the inventory accounts totaling ₱8,662,843.47 as of December 31, 
2020 is overstated by the (a) unrecorded materials and supplies issuances from 

April to December 2020 with undetermined amount; (b) unrecorded issuances of 

semi-expendable-books totaling ₱3,596,059.41; (c) misclassification as semi-

expendable instead of intangible of e-Books amounting to ₱1,541,895.20, 

resulting in unreconciled GL and Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) 

with a variance of ₱8,318,785.17; thus, unreliable.  (Paragraph No. 4) 

 

3. The reported PPE with total acquisition cost of ₱1,261,233,145.59 is not accurate 



iv  

due to (a) unrecorded laptops that understated the account Information & 

Communication Technology Equipment by ₱2,945,000.00; (b) erroneous 

recording of e-Subscription that overstated the account Books by ₱989,030.00 and 

understated the Subscription Expenses; (c) unrecorded PPE found at station with 

undetermined cost ; (d) non-derecognition of transferred/disposed vehicles that 

overstated the account Motor Vehicles by ₱2,574,020.00 and the corresponding 

Accumulated Depreciation; (e) inclusion of semi-expendable items costing 

₱145,565.00 in the PPE. (Paragraph No. 5) 

 

4. The erroneous recording of the payment for subscription of e-books, journals and 
other reading materials overstated the accounts Other Prepayments by 

₱1,000,000.00 and Subscription Expenses/Accumulated Surplus by 

₱2,464,657.58, and understated the account Prepaid Subscription by 

₱3,464,657.58; thus, rendering said accounts unreliable.  (Paragraph No. 8) 

 
5. Erroneous recording of the receipt of NCA for Trust Fund totaling ₱1,072,520.00 

as account Subsidy from NG instead of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust 

account resulting in the overstatement of both accounts by the same amount.  

(Paragraph No. 10) 

 

 

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 

 

The following are the other audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations which were discussed with Management officials concerned 

during the exit conference, details of which are further discussed in the report. 

Management views and comments were also incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

 

1. The agency (a) did not remit to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) the year-end 
balance of the account Cash in Bank, LCCA totaling ₱3,271,195.64 representing 

receipts from sale of bid documents, registration/seminar fees, and 

guaranty/security deposits, contrary to the GP of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for 

FY 2020, depriving the government of funds that could have been used for other 

necessary projects. Moreover, the Chief Accountant was (b) unable to prepare and 

submit the bank reconciliation statements (BRS) on time, precluding the timely 

verification and determination of reconciling items needing adjustments, and (c) a 

prior year deposit of ₱262,863.89 was unaccounted due to the absence of Credit 

Memos (CMs). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 

a. classify the ₱3,271,195.64 receipts into: i) income of the general fund (sale 
of bid documents and registration/seminar fees) and ii) trust receipts 

(guaranty/security deposits) to be remitted to the BTr, in compliance with 

Sections 7 and 12 GP of the GAA for FY 2020 and Paragraph 6.2 of DBM 

Budget Circular 2004-5A; 



v  

 

b. prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the ₱900,000.00 fund 
transfer from the NCCA under the account Due to NGAs; 

 

c. account for the prior year deposit totaling ₱262,863.89 and prepare the 
necessary adjusting entry; and 

 

d. henceforth, strictly comply with the preparation and submission of the BRS 
in compliance with  Sections 4 to 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

2. The variance of ₱22,945,433.59 between the accounting records and confirmation 
replies rendered unreliable the balance of the account Due from NGAs totaling 

₱26,856,990.57 as of December 31, 2020.  Moreover, discrepancy of ₱5,085.50 

between the GL and the Subsidiary Ledger (SL), and unliquidated advances to 

PS-DBM of ₱177,253.82 were noted. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

a. reconcile the discrepancy between the GL and the SL and prepare the 
necessary adjusting entry; 

 

b. coordinate closely with the IAs for the resolution of the discrepancies noted 
between the SL balances and the confirmation results, and adjust the 

affected accounts accordingly; 

 

c. make representation with the IAs (DBM-PS, UPS and DPWH) for the 
immediate refund of the unexpended balances; and 

 

d. henceforth, monitor IAs’ progress to ensure that fund transfers are liquidated 
within the prescribed period. 

 

3. The validity, reliability and propriety of the account balance of the CIP as of 
December 31, 2020 amounting ₱363,861,784.60 could not be ascertained due to: 

(a) the inadequacy of documentary requirements to support the claims for 

payment in the DVs; (b) the lack of signatures/approval by duly authorized 

officials on the DVs; and (c) the discrepancy of ₱158,217.99 between the GL and 

the CIP breakdown, all in violation of pertinent laws and regulations.  Moreover, 

(d) the delayed submission of contracts and supporting documents precluded the 

Audit Team from timely review and from issuing corrective measures that would 

prevent deficiencies to occur. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. instruct the BAC to submit to the Audit Team: 
i. the required documents to be forwarded to the COA Technical Audit 

team for review and evaluation; and 



vi  

ii. henceforth, copies of contracts together with the complete supporting 
documents within five working days from execution thereof as provided 

in Section 3.1.2  of COA Circular 2009-001 and pertinent provision of 

the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184. 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to: 
i. ensure that all DVs and supporting documents are complete and duly 

signed by authorized officials; 

ii. reconcile the discrepancy in the CIP account and prepare the necessary 
adjusting entry; and 

iii. prepare the SL of the CIP account pursuant to Section 114 of PD No. 
1445. 

 

4. The balance of the Other Payables account as of December 31, 2020 totaling 
₱6,987,091.03 could not be ascertained as to its accuracy and reliability due to the 

absence of SL or schedule to support the recorded balance, thereby, affecting the 

fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

prepare a schedule of Other Payables to support the reported balance; and 

maintain the required SL and reconcile with the GL regularly to ensure the 

accuracy of the two records.   

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year's Audit Recommendations 

 

Of the 42 audit recommendations contained in the prior year's Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), 10 were implemented and 32 were not implemented. The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
