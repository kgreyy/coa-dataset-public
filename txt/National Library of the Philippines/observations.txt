OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 

Incorrect year-end account balance of Cash-Collecting Officer (Cash-CO) 

 

1. The balance of the Cash-CO account of ₱4,354.13 as of December 31, 2020 is 
understated due to an erroneous recording of collections totaling ₱13,239.01 as 

deposited but were actually on-hand as of year-end; hence, overstating the 

accounts Cash, Treasury/Agency Deposits, Regular by ₱2,239.01 and the Cash in 

Bank, Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) by ₱11,000.00. 

 

Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) states that an entity shall present information including accounting policies in 

a manner that meets qualitative characteristics such as reliability and faithful 

representation, as described in IPSAS 1: 

 

e. Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and 
bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that 

which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 

represent. 

 

f. Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully 
transactions and other events, it should be presented in 

accordance with the substance of the transactions and other 

events, and not merely their legal form 

 

Further, Section 4 declares that the responsibility for the fair presentation and 

reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting entity, 

particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his 

authorized representative. 

 

Verification of the Cash Receipts Journal (CRJ) disclosed that collections in 

December 2020 totaling ₱13,239.01 were recorded as deposited when in fact, said 

collections were still in the custody of the collecting officer at year end, to wit:

Total 11,000.00 2,239.01 

 

The erroneous recording of the collections as deposited at year-end resulted in 

the understatement of the Cash-CO account by ₱13,239.01 and overstatement of the 

accounts Cash, Treasury/Agency Deposits, Regular by ₱2,239.01 and Cash in Bank, 

LCCA by ₱11,000.00. 

 

Further review of the CRJ and General Ledger (GL) showed that collections for 

Bid Docs, Performance Security Deposits, Refund and Seminar Fees aggregating 

₱105,035.13 were not posted in the GL, with the following details: 
 

Particulars Amount (₱) 

Cash Receipts Journal – Trust (Refund/NCCA)               2,079.51 

Cash Receipts Journal – Trust (Bidders/Seminars/Others) 101,010.97 

Cash Journal – NG Books 1,944.65 

            Total 105,035.13 

 

Although there is zero effect on the account balance of the Cash-CO at year-

end, the non-posting to the GL did not conform to Section 114 of PD No. 1445 that 

describes the GL as the book of final entry which summarizes all transactions recorded 

in the General Journal (GJ) and special journals.  Section 48, Chapter 19, Volume I of 

the GAM further explains that all the GL accounts and their balances at a given time 

are listed in the Trial Balance (TB), and that the TB shows the equality of debit and 

credit balances of all GL accounts as at a given period. 

 

Financial statements do not comply with IPSASs when they contain either 

material errors, or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular 

presentation of an entity’s Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial 

Performance, or Statement of Cash Flows. (Section 42, Chapter 19, Volume I, GAM) 
 

It was further noted that the balance of ₱4,354.13 as of December 31, 2020 

represents prior year’s collection, which remained unaccounted and undeposited. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to reverse the erroneous entry of 
deposit at year-end totaling ₱13,239.01, and subsequently record it on the 

actual date of deposit; 

 

b. exert extra effort to account and deposit the prior years’ balance of 
₱4,354.13; 

 



28 

 

c. henceforth, summarize in the GL all transactions recorded in the GJ and 
special journals, in conformity with accounting rules and regulations, and 

disclose events after the reporting date in the Notes to FS instead of 

erroneous inclusion in the current year. 

 

 
 Unremitted balance of Cash in Bank, LCCA to BTr 

 

2. The agency (a) did not remit to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) the year-end 
balance of the account Cash in Bank, LCCA totaling ₱3,271,195.64 representing 

the excess proceeds of receipts from sale of bid documents, registration/seminar 

fees, and guaranty/security deposits, contrary to the GP of RA No. 11465 or the 

GAA for FY 2020, depriving the government of funds that could have been used 

for other necessary projects. Moreover, the Chief Accountant was (b) unable to 

prepare and submit the bank reconciliation statements (BRS) on time, precluding 

the timely verification and determination of reconciling items needing 

adjustments, and (c) a prior year deposit of ₱262,863.89 was unaccounted due to 

the absence of Credit Memos (CMs). 

 

Section 7 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that performance bonds 

and deposits filed or posted by private persons or entities with government agencies 

shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts, in 

accordance with Executive Order (EO) No. 338 dated May 17, 1996. 

 

Section 2 of  EO No. 338 provides that: 

 

All existing balances of trust receipts deposited with authorized 

government depository banks or any forthcoming trust receipt 

which are intended to be deposited with authorized government 

depository banks are hereby required to be deposited with the 

National Treasury. 

 

On the other hand, Section 12 of the GP authorizes government agencies which 

conduct training programs in relation to their mandated functions to collect seminar, 

conference, training and oath taking fees from government and private agency 

participants. Such proceeds may be used for the conduct of said activities while any 

excess proceeds shall be deposited with the National Treasury as income of the General 

Fund. 

       

The same treatment is given to proceeds of sale of bid documents under 

Paragraph 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular N o .  2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, to 

wit: 

 

Pursuant to DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Resolution 

No. 2005-2 dated June 2005, all agencies are authorized to treat 

collections from proceeds of sale of bid documents as trust receipts 



29 

 

to be used exclusively for the payment of honoraria and overtime 

pay herein authorized. Agencies may utilize up to one hundred 

percent (100%) of the said collections for the payment of 

honoraria and overtime pay xxx. Any excess in the amount 

collected shall be remitted by NGAs to the Bureau of the Treasury. 

xxx. 

 

a) Non-remittance of receipts to BTr  
 

Verification disclosed that contrary to the above-cited laws, rules and 

regulations, the amount of ₱3,271,195.64 representing the excess proceeds at year-end 

receipts from sale of bid documents, registration/seminar fees, and guaranty/security 

deposits remained unremitted to the BTr as of December 31, 2020, depriving the 

government of funds that could be used for other necessary projects.  The only detail 

provided by the Accountant is as follows: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) 

Beginning Balance 3,005,934.32 

Add: CY 2020 Deposits

CY 2020 Balance  265,261.32 

Balance as of December 31, 2020  3,271,195.64 

 

b) Delayed preparation and submission of BRS 
 

The preparation and submission of the BRS for the whole year was delayed, 

thereby precluding the Audit Team from the timely verification and determination of 

reconciling items needing adjustments, such as the agency’s failure to record in the 

books the fund transfer from the National Commission on the Culture and the Arts 

(NCCA) amounting to ₱900,000.00, understating the Due to NGAs account.  

 

The BRS for January to October 2020 were submitted only on January 7, 2021, 

while the BRS for November and December were in March 2021, in non-conformity 

with  Sections 4 to 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM, which requires the Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff to: 

 

1) prepare the monthly BRS for each of the bank accounts maintained by the 
agency/entity within 10 days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) 

together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda/Credit 

Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing Bank; 

2) reconcile the BS with the General Ledger; 
3) prepare a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize all reconciling items that 

require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts; and 



30 

 

4) submit the BRS to the Audit Team  within 20 days after receipt of the BS. 
 

c) a prior year deposits of ₱262,863.89 was unaccounted  
 

Further verification of BRS disclosed a note “For Reconciliation (Prior Years)” 

totaling ₱262,863.89 with no counterpart entry or corresponding match in the books.  

Inquiry disclosed that the ₱262,863.89 pertained to prior year deposits, however, it was 

unaccounted due to the absence of CMs.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. classify the ₱3,271,195.64 receipts into: i) income of the general fund (sale of 
bid documents and registration/seminar fees) and ii) trust receipts 

(guaranty/security deposits) to be remitted to the BTr, in compliance with 

Sections 7 and 12 GP of the GAA for FY 2020 and Paragraph 6.2 of DBM 

Budget Circular 2004-5A; 

 

b. prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the ₱900,000.00 fund 
transfer from the NCCA under the account Due to NGAs; 

 

c. account for the prior year deposit totaling ₱262,863.89 and prepare the 
necessary adjusting entry; and 

 

d. henceforth, strictly comply with the preparation and submission of the BRS 
in compliance with  Sections 4 to 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

 

Unreliable Due from NGAs account balance 
 

3. The variance of ₱22,945,433.59 between the accounting records and confirmation 
replies rendered unreliable the balance of the account Due from NGAs totaling 

₱26,856,990.57 as of December 31, 2020.  Moreover, discrepancy of ₱5,085.50 

between the GL and the Subsidiary Ledger (SL), and unliquidated advances to 

PS-DBM of ₱177,253.82 were noted. 

 

a) discrepancy between the GL and SL 
 

Section 114 of PD No. 1445 provides for a general ledger, to wit: 

 

1. The government accounting system shall be on a double entry 
basis with a general ledger in which all financial transactions 

are recorded. 

 

2. Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary. 
 

The SL stores the details or breakdown of the balance of the controlling account 

appearing in the GL. The purpose of keeping subsidiary ledgers is for accuracy and 



31 

 

efficiency. The totals of the SL balances should be reconciled with their respective 

control account regularly to ensure the accuracy of the two records.  

 

Analysis of the four agencies comprising the account Due from NGAs with 

balances aggregating ₱26,856,990.57 disclosed an unreconciled amount of ₱5,085.50 

as of December 31, 2020, with details as follows: 

 

Balance per book (GL) as of December 31, 2020 26,856,990.57

A discrepancy between the SL and GL arise when error is committed during 

posting in the GL or posting in the SL or due to unrecorded liquidations. The agency’s 

Accountant, however, could not immediately pinpoint where the error lies because the 

reconciliation of the ledgers is not yet completed. 

 

b) Variance between accounting records and confirmation replies 



32 

 

 

Confirmations were sent to the four agencies with SL balances aggregating 

₱26,851,905.07, three of which replied.  However, comparison of the confirmed 

amount versus the SL balances showed a total discrepancy of ₱22,945,433.59. with the

Total    26,851,905.07  22,945,433.59 

 

Confirmation replies from the three agencies showed the following: 

 

1) The STII’s financial report showed an unexpended balance of ₱70,634.32, 

which was refunded on May 3, 2019 per OR no. 0445109; thus, a zero balance 

in its books. The project was completed in 2018. 

 

2) The UPS reported a balance of ₱3,620,595.63.  A total of ₱3,738,323.61 from 

the fund transfer of ₱7,358,919.24 had already been utilized and liquidated for 

the intended project as of December 31, 2020. The project had been 

substantially completed and is now being used by the end-users. 

 

3) The DPWH’s financial record showed an unexpended balance of ₱108,622.03. 

The intended project of the fund transfer was already completed, however, the 

required Certificate of Completion as stated in the Memorandum of Agreement 

(MOA) was not yet submitted to NLP. 

 

The NLP failed to monitor the submission by the Implementing Agencies (IAs) 

of RCIs, RDs and other supporting documents in compliance with COA Circular 94-

013 and as stated in the MOA. It also did not regularly analyze its receivable accounts 

to ensure that fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period; thus, rendered 

the account’s balance unreliable. 
 

Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 - Rules and Regulations in the Grant, 

Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies, dated 

December 13, 1994 provides that: 
 

Within ten days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 
period for the project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks 
Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the 
utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be 
reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA. 



33 

 

 

While Section 5.4 provides that: 

 
The SA shall require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the 
IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures. 
 

To ensure that fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period, 

monitoring of IAs’ progress is necessary, including regular and periodic verification of 

the reports being submitted by IAs.  Any unliquidated fund transfers is to be reconciled, 

and all reconciling items noted is to be adjusted accordingly. The IA shall return to the 

SA any unused balance upon completion of the project, in conformity with  Section 4.9 

of the same COA Circular No. 94-013. 

  

c)  Undelivered advances to PS-DBM 
 

Review of the SL for PS-DBM revealed that the ₱177,253.00 pertained to prior 

years’ advances for the procurement of common-used office supplies, which remained 

undelivered as of December 31, 2020, with details as follows: 

 

Particulars   Advances   Deliveries   Amount (₱) 

Beginning balance, 1/1/2019             369,002.98  

CY 2019 68,080.53  220,606.44  (152,525.91)  

CY 2020 41,822.50        81,045.75  (39,223.25)  

Balance as of December 31, 2020             177,253.82  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. reconcile the discrepancy between the GL and the SL and prepare the 
necessary adjusting entry; 

 

b. coordinate closely with the IAs for the resolution of the discrepancies noted 
between the SL balances and the confirmation results, and adjust the 

affected accounts accordingly; 

 

c. make representation with the IAs (DBM-PS, UPS and DPWH) for the 
immediate refund of the unexpended balances; and 

 

d. henceforth, monitor IAs’ progress to ensure that fund transfers are 
liquidated within the prescribed period. 

 

 

Unreliable Inventory Accounts 
 

4. The balance of the inventory accounts totaling ₱8,662,843.47 as of December 31, 
2020 is overstated by the (a) unrecorded materials and supplies issuances from 

April to December 2020 with undetermined amount; (b) unrecorded issuances of 

semi-expendable-books totaling ₱3,596,059.41; (c) misclassification as semi-



34 

 

expendable instead of intangible of e-Books amounting to ₱1,541,895.20, resulting 

in unreconciled GL and Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) with a 

variance of ₱8,318,785.17; thus, unreliable.  Moreover,  (d) no physical count was 

conducted on semi-expendables, and (e) the Supply Ledger Cards (SLCs), which 

is used to record receipt and issue of materials are not updated, aggravating the 

inaccuracy of the inventory accounts. 
  

The inventory accounts with carrying amount of ₱8,662,843.47 as of December 

31, 2020, is broken down below: 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Comparison between the RPCI and the inventory balances per books disclosed 

a variance of ₱8,318,785.17 as of December 31, 2020, with the following details: 

  

Account Per GL (₱) Per RPCI (₱) Variance (₱) 

Office Supplies Inventory 1,270,146.95 302,018.30 968,128.64

Total 8,662,843.47 343,698.29 8,318,785.17 

 

Further review of the Inventory accounts revealed that the variance noted was 

a result of various deficiencies, resulting in overstatement of at least ₱5,137,954.61, 

rendering the account unreliable. 

 

a) Unrecorded materials and supplies issuances with undetermined amount 
 

Only the issuances of office supplies for the period January to March 2020 were 

recorded in the books, while the issuances for the months of April to December 2020 

were not recorded and could not be accounted for due to non-submission by the 

Property/Supply Officer of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) 

(Appendix 64), contrary to Section 17(g), Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM, overstating 

the Supplies Inventory and understating the Office Supplies Expenses.  The GAM 

provides that the RSMI is prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian and shall 

be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the 

supplies  and materials issued. 

 

 

Accounts Amounts (₱) 
Office Supplies Inventory 1,270,146.95 
Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 2,207,458.86 
Semi-expendable ICT Equipment      47,283.05 
Semi-Expendable Books 5,137,954.61 

Total 8,662,843. 47 



35 

 

b) Unrecorded issuances of semi-expendable-books 
 

The semi-expendable books were immediately distributed to end-users 

(Reading Room, Public Library Division and Reference Division) upon acquisition by 

the Collection Development Division (CDD), however, no Inventory Custodian Slips 

(ICSs) (Appendix 59) were prepared and submitted to the Accounting Section for 

recording of their issuance, contrary to Section 17(l); thereby, overstating the Semi-

Expendable-Books account and understating the Semi-Expendable-Books Expenses by 

₱3,596,059.41 (₱5,137,954.61 minus ₱1,541,895.20). 

 

c) Misclassification of  e-Books as semi-expendable instead of  intangible  
 

Other Intangible Assets as described by the Revised Chart of Accounts, Volume 

III of the GAM is used to recognize the cost of obtaining other identifiable non-

monetary assets without physical substance xxx. This includes trademarks, marketing 

rights, franchises, licenses, electronic copies (CD/DVD) of published materials, and 

the like.  

 

Verification disclosed that purchases of e-Books in years 2019 and 2020 

aggregating ₱1,541,895.20 were recorded as semi-expendable instead of intangible, 

which resulted in overstating the account Semi-Expandable-Books and understating the 

account Other Intangible Assets and the related accumulated amortization. 
 
d) No physical count of semi-expendables 

 

Section 13 of the same Chapter emphasizes that physical count/inventory, 

which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the 

integrity of property custodianship. The RPCI (Appendix 66) is described under Section 

17(i) as the form used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as 

at a given date. These supplies include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue 

is covered by ICS. 
 
e) The SLCs are not updated 

 

As provided in Section 17(c),  the SLC (Appendix 57) shall be used to record 

materials received and issued, and their balances both in quantity and amount, at any 

time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies 

and materials. The maintenance of the SLC allows the verification of the amount of 

inventory on hand at all times.  
 

Review of the SLCs showed that the last transaction posted therein was in May 
2017; thus, could not be relied upon to show accurate inventory balances both in 
quantity and amount. 

 
 
 
 



36 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the Property/Supply Officer to prepare the RSMIs for the months 
of April to December 2020 and submit these reports to the Accountant as 
basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued; 
 

b. instruct the CDD to coordinate with the Property/Supply Officer for the 
preparation of ICS as basis in preparing the JEV to record the semi-
expendable-books issued to end-users totaling ₱3,596,059.41; 

 
c. instruct the Accountant to prepare JEV for the reclassification of the e-

Books totaling ₱1,541,895.20 from Semi Expendable-Books to Other 
Intangible Assets, and recognize the corresponding Accumulated 
Amortization; 
 

d. demand the Accountant to expedite the update of the SLCs; and 
 

e. henceforth (i) require the Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to 
coordinate on the recording of receipts and issues of materials to ensure a 
reconciled inventory records at any given time, and (ii) instruct the 
Inventory Committee to include semi-expendables in the physical count of 
inventories. 

 

 

Unreliable PPE accounts balance 

 

5. The reported PPE with total acquisition cost of ₱1,261,233,145.59 is not accurate 
due to (a) unrecorded laptops that understated the account Information & 

Communication Technology Equipment by ₱2,945,000.00; (b) erroneous 

recording of e-Subscription that overstated the account Books by ₱989,030.00 and 

understated the Subscription Expenses; (c) unrecorded PPE found at station with 

undetermined cost ; (d) non-derecognition of transferred/disposed vehicles that 

overstated the account Motor Vehicles by ₱2,574,020.00 and the corresponding 

Accumulated Depreciation; (e) inclusion of semi-expendable items costing 

₱145,565.00 in the PPE; and (f) non-inclusion of various PPE in the physical 

count, aggravating the already material discrepancy of ₱961,898,378.84 between 

the accounting records and RPCPPE.  Moreover, (g) the PPELCs and PCs are not 

being maintained, and the PARs for some properties are not being issued. 

  
As of December 31, 2020, the PPE accounts of the NLP amounted to 

₱1,261,233,145.59 with a total accumulated depreciation of ₱568,461,289.87.  
 
Comparison of the GL balance of ₱1,261,233,145.59 against the Report on the 

Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) reported balance of ₱458,220,460.07 disclosed a 
discrepancy of ₱961,898,378.84, as shown on the next page:

Further review of the PPE accounts revealed that the variance noted was a result 

of various uncorrected deficiencies and overstatement/understatement of PPE 

accounts, rendering the said accounts unreliable. 
 

a) unaccounted laptops understated the ICTE 
 

Examination of pertinent documents revealed that purchases of e-Books (with 

perpetual access) made during the current year totaling ₱5,567,149.09 were bundled 

with 113 sets of laptops.  Further, the Audit Team noted errors in recording the 

purchases, which resulted in overstatement/understatement of the affected accounts.  

Details are as follows:

The 113 sets of laptops that were bundled with the purchase of e-Books were 

not recognized as PPE under the account ICTE, contrary to Section 4, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM, which provides: 

 

The capitalization threshold of P15,000 represents the minimum 
cost of an individual asset recognized as PPE on the Statement of 
Financial Position. 

 

While the e-Books are considered intangible that should be recorded under the 

account Other Intangible Assets. The erroneous recording of the purchase of e-Books 

packaged with laptops resulted in the understatement of the accounts Other Intangible 

Assets and ICTE by ₱2,622,149.09 and ₱2,945,000.00, respectively, and overstatement 

of Books and Other Supplies and Materials Expenses by ₱2,767,149.09 and 

₱2,800,000.00, respectively. 

 

Further, the non-recording of the 113 laptops as ICTE, and their non-inclusion 

in the RPCPPE expose said laptops to risk of loss or misuse. 

 

Section 42(g) of the same Chapter of the GAM states the necessity of RPCPPE, 

to wit: 

 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count 
and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those 
which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. 
It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and 
the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory 
Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by 
the entity. 

 

b) erroneous recording of e-Subscription 
 

The 12-month subscription of NLP to “iGLibrary eBooks” starting January 23, 

2020 in the total amount of ₱989,030.00 was recorded as PPE under the account Books 

instead of Subscription Expenses; thus, overstating the latter and understating the 



39 

 

Subscription Expenses by the same amount. The subscribed “iGLibrary eBooks”, 

which is not downloadable, automatically expires at the end of the subscription period 

unless renewed. 

 

Prior years audit observations that were not resolved by management during the 

year are reviewed and updated, and reiterated in this report. The following deficiencies 

have been discussed in the CY 2019 AAR: 

 

c) unrecorded PPE found at station 

Section 38 of the same Chapter of the GAM requires for the recording of assets 

found at stations, as quoted below: 
 

Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the 
physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division /Unit 
for proper accounting/recording. 
 

Enumerated below are 50 air-conditioning units and two sets of Body 

Temperature Scanner that were found by the Audit Team installed in different 

areas/offices of the NLP Building, during their inspection.  Verification disclosed that 

these equipment were not recorded in the books of NLP:

The above air conditioning units were delivered and installed by the contractor 

AC Tumang Construction, however, review of the itemized cost breakdown for the 

related contract disclosed that there was no pay item for the provision of such 

equipment. 
 

On the other hand, the HIKVISION Walk-through Body Temperature Scanner 

was alleged to be a donation, however, no documents are presented to the Audit Team 



41 

 

to validate the claim. 

 

In addition, the following four sets of ICTE were found at the Batanes 

Provincial Library during inspection by the Auditors in CY 2019: 

 

Quantity Description Property No. Amount (₱) 

1 set Computer Desktop (CPU, 

Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse) 

NL-2954  

3 sets Computer Desktop NL-2955 1M to 2M 79,528.80 

 

Per interview with the Property Officer, the set of ICTE with Property No. NL-

2954 was one of the freebies or additional offer/package received by CDD from the 

supplier of e-Books, while the three sets of ICTE were donated/transferred properties 

from the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT) last July 

11, 2018. 
 

Further, the following items were also found at station: 
 

  Description Quantity Unit price Total 

 (₱) 

Book scanner 2 1,200,000.00 2,400,000.00 

Portable hard Drive 1 2,100,000.00 2,100,000.00 
Portable hard Drive 1 525,000.00   525,000.00 

Total   5,025,000.00 

 

These equipment found at station were not accounted in the books nor in the 

property records; thus, the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) (Appendix 71) and Property Card 

(PC) (Appendix 70) for the said properties to record the description, acquisition, 

transfer, disposal, and other information about the PPE were not maintained. Also, no 

Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) (Appendix 72) to report the issuance of PPE 

and the acknowledgement of the end-user was prepared yet for the air conditioning 

units. 

 

The Accountant explained that she has no basis in recording the equipment 

since she was not furnished with copy of pertinent documents. Likewise, the Property 

Officer could not prepare the PC and PAR due to lack of documents. 

 

d) non-derecognition of transferred/disposed vehicles 

Verification showed that four units of motor vehicles, Mazda T-2500 Chassis 

CAB with Van, amounting to ₱2,200,000.00, that were already donated/transferred to 

the affiliated public libraries on March 2019 were still carried in the books, with details 

below:

Total 2,200,000.00 

 

Moreover, the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property 

(IIRUP) as of October 5, 2016, listed one unit of Mitsubishi L300 vehicle costing 

₱374,020.0. This was subsequently disposed through sale in December 2016 but was 

not derecognized in the books, in non-conformity with Sections 15 and 39 of Chapter 

10, Volume I of the GAM, as quoted, respectively, below: 

 
Transfer from one government entity to another shall be 
recognized by recipient entity at net carrying value. The transferor 
shall derecognize the PPE account upon transfer. 

 

The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on 
disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential 
is expected from its use or disposal. 

 

Failure to drop from the books the cost of the transferred/disposed vehicles 

overstated the Motor Vehicles account by ₱2,574,020.00, and the related Accumulated 

Depreciation account. 

 

e) inclusion of semi-expendable items in the PPE 
 

The Furniture and Fixtures account included the following items costing 

₱145,565.00, which should have been treated as semi-expendable considering that their 

unit costs were below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00, in accordance with 

Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM on the Criteria for Recognition of PPE: 

 

Quantity Description Unit Cost (₱) Unit Cost (₱) 

5 pcs Self-reading carousel 14,663.00 73,315.00 

10 pcs Office Chair 7,225.00 72,250.00 

Total 145,565.00 

 

The Revised Chart of Accounts, Volume III of the GAM prescribes the account 

Semi-Expendable to recognize the cost/fair value of purchased/acquired item costing 

less than ₱15,000.00 for the use in government operations. 

 

f) non-inclusion of various PPE in the physical count 
 

It was learned that no physical count of books was conducted since year 2014; 



43 

 

hence, the existence, condition and completeness of the recorded balance of the account 

Books of ₱381,226,958.06 , which comprised 30.23 percent of the total PPE account 

balance, was not established. 

 

It was gathered that the NLP Catalog Division (CD) is the one responsible for 

the receipt and issuance of the acquired library materials. Those books intended for the 

affiliated public libraries are issued by the CD to the Public Library Division (PLD) for 

eventual distribution to the public libraries. While those books which are to be used as 

reference materials in the NLP Library are issued to the Reference Division (RD) and 

Filipiniana Division (FD). 
 

Though the Accountant is now being furnished with copy of Property Transfer 

Report (PTR), he commented that he still could not record the transactions due to 

incomplete information therein, such as the date when the books are acquired and the 

corresponding acquisition cost; thus, there is a possibility that the reported balance of 

the account Books still included the cost of books that were already distributed to 

affiliated public libraries as well as those books with unit cost of below ₱15,000.00 that 

should have already been reclassified to Semi-Expendable Books account upon the 

implementation of the GAM. 

 

Likewise, the Disaster Response and Rescue Equipment and the ongoing 

construction projects of the NLP were not included in the physical inventory taking, as 

can be gleaned from their zero balance under the column RPCPPE in the comparative 

table shown in page 37. 

 

g) non-maintenance of PPELC, PC and PAR 

Further review showed that no PPELC and PC were prepared and maintained 

by the Accounting Section and Property Section, respectively, for the books. Likewise, 

no property accountability records, either PAR or ICS, were prepared and issued by the 

Property Section to the custodian in the NLP Library of the reference books that were 

acquired in previous years ; thus, accountability therefor could not be established. It 

was only in CY 2019 that the Property Officer started the issuance of PAR or ICS to 

concerned Section Heads of the RD and FD, who are the ones responsible for the 

safekeeping and maintaining of the books. 
 

Section 42 of the same Chapter of the GAM, states: 

 
Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The 
Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of 
PPE xxx. For check and balance, the Property and Supply 
Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to 
account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance 
per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the 
Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with 
other property records like PAR. 

 



44 

 

Considering the materiality of the amount of discrepancy, a thorough 

examination of the accounting and property records and an extensive physical count of 

all the agency’s properties should be conducted. 

 

The above noted deficiencies casted doubt on the reliability of the reported PPE 

accounts balance, affecting the fair presentation of the agency’s financial statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Assistant Director to: 
(i) develop a plan/strategy for the reconciliation of the PPE accounts, 

detailing the activities to be undertaken, personnel to be assigned for 
the activity, duration and corresponding deliverables; 

 
(ii) oversee the proper implementation of the reconciliation plan/strategy 

and monitor the progress of the reconciliation process; and 
 

(iii) assess the capacities of all the personnel involved in the receipt, 
disposition and management of the PPE, and accordingly conduct 
capacity development and/or replace the personnel incapable of 
performing the required function. 

 

b. PLD to: 
(i) furnish the Accounting Unit with pertinent records/documents on the 

library materials that were distributed to affiliated public libraries in 

prior years so that the same could be dropped from the books; and 

(ii) provide relevant information in the PTR for easy cross-referencing in 
the accounting records. 

 

c. Property Office to: 
(i) determine the fair value of properties found at station for recording in 

the books; 

(ii) issue applicable property accountability records for the PPE found at 
station and for the reference books in the NLP Library; and  

(iii) prepare and maintain PC for all PPE. 
 

d. Accountant to: 
(i) record the unaccounted laptops and all other freebies from the 

purchase of e-books, journals and other reading materials and prepare 

the necessary adjusting entries to correct the erroneous recording of 

the affected accounts; 

(ii) record in the books those PPE found at station; 
 

(iii) drop from the books the cost of books already issued to public libraries 
based on the report of the PLD as well as those transferred/disposed 

PPE; 
 

(iv) reclassify those books with unit cost below the capitalization threshold 
to the proper account; and 

 



45 

 

(v) prepare and maintain PPELC for the library reference books with unit 
cost of ₱15,000.00 and above; 

 

e. Inventory Committee to: 
(i) conduct an extensive physical count of all properties, including books, 

Disaster Response and Rescue Equipment and Construction in 
Progress (CIP) accounts; and 

(ii) immediately reconcile the result of physical count with the accounting 
and property records, for early detection and adjustment of 
discrepancy. 

 

 

Unreliable CIP account balance 
 

6. The validity, reliability and propriety of the account balance of the CIP as of 
December 31, 2020 amounting ₱363,861,784.60 could not be ascertained due to: 

(a) the inadequacy of documentary requirements to support the claims for 

payment in the DVs; (b) the lack of signatures/approval by duly authorized 

officials on the DVs; and (c) the discrepancy of ₱158,217.99 between the GL and 

the CIP breakdown, all in violation of pertinent laws and regulations.  Moreover, 

(d) the delayed submission of contracts and supporting documents precluded the 

Audit Team from timely review and from issuing corrective measures that would 

prevent deficiencies to occur. 

 

a) Inadequacy of documentary requirements to support claims 
 

Section 4.6 of P.D No. 1445 provides that all claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

Verification of the DVs for the payments made to A.C. Tumang Construction 

for the “Structural Retrofitting of NLP including restoration of the affected areas Phase 

V: Design and Build” disclosed that as of December 31, 2020, the contractor had 

already claimed 97.91 percent work accomplishment from January 15, 2018 to July 17, 

2020 amounting to ₱277,318,741.01, as shown below:

On July 17, 2020, the project had a work accomplishment amounting to 

₱259,612,523.70 or equivalent to 95 percent of the total contract price of 

₱273,276,340.74, however, the NLP failed to create an inspectorate team to make 

preliminary inspection and submit a punch-list to the contractor in preparation for the 

final turn-over of the project. 

 

Lack of complete documentation by management for the implementation of the 

projects undertaken by the contractor hindered proper validation on the existence and 

extent of the project accomplishments, including evaluation of the reasonableness of 

the expenditures incurred.  Likewise, review, evaluation and inspection by COA 

Technical Audit Team could not be done. 

 

Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that “It is the declared policy of the State that 

all resources of the government  shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance 

with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or  wastage through illegal or 

improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in 

the operations of the government.  The responsibility to take care that such policy is 

faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency 

concerned.” 

 

b) absence of signatures/approval by duly authorized officials 
 

Section 4.5 of PD No. 1445 states that “Disbursements or disposition of 

government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials.” 

 

Verification of paid DVs and supporting documents for A.C. Tumang 

Construction bear no complete signatures and certification of the duly authorized  

officials.

c) Discrepancy of ₱158,217.99 between the GL and the CIP details per contract 
 

Analysis of the account CIP disclosed an unreconciled balance between the GL

Among the reasons of the discrepancy was the non-maintenance of SL. 

 

The SL stores the details or breakdown of the balance of the controlling account 

appearing in the GL. The purpose of keeping SLs is for accuracy and efficiency. The 

totals of the SL balances should be regularly reconciled to ensure the accuracy of the 

two records. This is emphasized in Section 114 of PD No. 1445, which provides that 

the government accounting system shall be on a double entry basis with a general 

ledger in which all financial transactions are recorded, and that subsidiary records shall 

be kept where necessary.

d) delayed submission of contracts and supporting documents for review  
 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 states “that within five (5) working 

days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, 

agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 

corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the 

documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the 

Auditor of the Agency concerned xxx”. 

 

The basic contract documents that are required to be submitted to the Auditor 

are listed in Section 3.1.2 of said Circular. The same documents are enumerated under 

RA No. 9184 that form part of infrastructure contract. 

 

Record shows that the contract and supporting documents of the following 

Infrastructure Projects of the NLP were not submitted to the Audit Team within five 

working days from execution of a contract, contrary to Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 

2009-001. The contracts were only submitted to the Audit Team during the submission 

of DVs for the payment of 15 percent Mobilization Fee, as follows:

The delayed submission of the contract and supporting documents prevented 

the Audit Team from conducting a timely review thereof; thus, measures to correct the 

noted deficiencies were not immediately communicated.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the BAC to submit to the Audit Team: 
i. the required documents to be forwarded to the COA Technical Audit 

Team for review and evaluation; and 

ii. henceforth, copies of contracts together with the complete supporting 
documents within five working days from execution thereof as

provided in Section 3.1.2  of COA Circular 2009-001 and pertinent 

provision of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184. 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to: 
i. ensure that all DVs and supporting documents are complete and duly 

signed by authorized officials; 

ii. reconcile the discrepancy in the CIP account and prepare the necessary 
adjusting entry; and 

iii. prepare the SL of the CIP account pursuant to Section 114 of PD No. 
1445. 

 

 

Non-compliance with pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184. 

 

7. The agency did not comply with pertinent provisions of Annex E, 2016 Revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184 on the Contact 

Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects 

 

1) Requests for time extension for Infrastructure Project were not supported 
with proper documents, as required in Section 10 of Annex E; hence, the Audit 

Team could not validate the reasons stated therein. 

 

Section 10, Annex E states: 

 

10.1 Should the amount of additional work of any kind or other 

special circumstances of any kind whatsoever occur xxx, delivered 

to the procuring entity notices in order that it could have 

investigated them at that time.  Failure to provide such notice shall 

constitute a waiver by the contractor of any claim. Upon receipt of 

full and detailed particulars, the procuring entity shall examine the 

facts and extent of the delay and shall extend the contract time 

completing the contract work when, in the procuring entity's 

opinion, the findings of facts justify an extension. 

 

10.3 Extension of contract time may be granted only when the 

affected activities fall within the critical path of the PERT/CPM 

network. 

 

10.4 No extension of contract time shall be granted when the 

reason given to support the request for extension was already 

considered in the determination of the original contract time 

during the conduct of detailed engineering and in the preparation 

of the contract documents as agreed upon by the parties before 

contract perfection.

52 

 

Date of Letter 

request 

Reasons No. of days of 

extension 

Remarks 

b. Library Information Services 
(LIS) Month – November 2019 

 

We noted that the Head of the Agency had no communication/letter for 

approving the number of days of extension of work, but instead the Director and 

Assistant Director both signed beneath the Conforme portion of the letter request 

submitted by the contractor. 

 

In addition, a letter was sent to the NLP Director dated December 20, 2019 from 

the NLP Assistant Director, proposing change order for the project in the amount 

₱20,000,000.00, a 7.33 percent increase of the total contract price. The request was 

approved by the Director by affixing his signature on the letter. The number of days to 

complete the additional/change order was not stipulated in the letter and the supporting 

documents, such as notices from the contractor for variation order, plans to effect the 

adjustments, detailed estimates of the unit cost and justification for the need or for the 

change order were not submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

The reasons indicated above could not be validated due to the absence of the 

Contract Plan, approve original and revised PERT/CPM Network, showing that the 

affected activities fall within the critical path of the network and the supporting 

documents for the change order. 

 

2) Liquidated damages for non-completion of work within the specified contract 
time was not imposed to AC Tumang Construction, in violation of Section 8.1, 

Annex E, RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

Section 8.1 of Annex E provides that where the contractor refuses or fails to 

complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly 

granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the 

procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount as 

provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one percent 

of the cost of the unperfomed portion of the work for every day of delay. 

 

On the other hand, Volume 3 under Delays and Work Completion and 

Liquidated Damages, of the Manual of Procedures for the  Procurement of 

Infrastructure Projects (developed pursuant to RA No. 9184) provides “The Procuring 

Entity may grant time extensions, at its discretion, if such extensions are meritorious, 

with or without liquidated damages. Maximum allowable extension shall not exceed 

the original construction period.” 

 

As stipulated in the contract with a total contract price of ₱273,276,340.74, the 

project  is to  be completed within  a maximum period of 360 calendar days (CDs) that 



53 

 

commenced on  January 29, 2018 from receipt of Notice to Proceed dated January 15, 

2018. Aside from the above-mentioned extension letters and change order letters, no 

additional documents were submitted to support the delay in the completion of the 

project. 

 

In addition, we noted that the submitted Statement of Elapsed and Work 

Accomplishment (SEWA) was not accurate.  It showed a no negative slippage in the 

work accomplishment despite of the delays incurred. Completion date in SEWA  varies 

from 2nd billing, which is on January 29, 2019 to the 5th billing, which is on June 30, 

2019. 

 

Per original contract, the project must be completed on January 29, 2019.  But, 

as of December 31, 2020, the construction is still on-going with no liquidated damages 

being imposed by NLP. 

 

Shown below are the number of days extension/incurred by A.C. Tumang 

Construction: 

  

Period Covered No. of CD 

January 29, 2018 to December 31, 2018 337 days 

January 1 to December 31, 2019 365 days 

January 1 to December 31, 2020 366 days 

Total No. of days Incurred 

No. of days as stipulated in the contract 

1,068 days 

360 days 

Maximum number allowed for extension per RA 9184 360 days 

No. of days extension/delayed 348 days 

 

The non-imposition of liquidated damages was due to poor monitoring of status 

of infrastructure projects by Management and lack of coordination with the Accounting 

Unit by the Project-In-Charge; thus, the contractor was not penalized for his inefficient 

performance.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the contractor to submit Contract Plan and original/revised 
PERT/CPM, and additional documents to support the delay in the completion 

of the project; 

 

b.  require the contractor to immediately pay the estimated liquidated damages 
and/or deduct the amount from the final payment; and 

 

c. direct the Project-In-Charge in NLP to strictly monitor the status of 
infrastructure projects and coordinate with the Accounting Section any delay 

in project completion for proper computation of liquidated damages. 

 

 



54 

 

Unreliable Prepayments 

 
8. The erroneous recording of the payment for subscription of e-books, journals and 

other reading materials overstated the accounts Other Prepayments by 

₱1,000,000.00 and Subscription Expenses/Accumulated Surplus by ₱2,464,657.58, 

and understated the account Prepaid Subscription by ₱3,464,657.58; thus, 

rendering said accounts unreliable.  Moreover, SLs for these accounts are not 

being maintained. 

 

Examination of pertinent documents revealed that advance payments of 

subscriptions  of e-Books during the year amounting to ₱1,000,000.00 were incorrectly 

recorded under the account Other Prepayments, and amounting to ₱2,464,657.58 were 

recorded as outright subscription expenses, instead of the account Prepaid 

Subscriptions, contrary to the Revised Chart of Accounts, Volume III of the GAM, 

which describes the affected accounts as follows: 

 

Account Name Description 

Prepaid Subscription Used to recognize the amount advanced for the 

subscription of ICT software, data center service, cloud 

computing service, library and other reading materials, and 

the like, used in government operations. This account is 

credited for the expended amount, and/or adjustments. 

Other Prepayments Used to recognize the amount of prepayments not falling 

under any of the specific prepayment accounts. 

Subscription Expenses Used to recognize the cost of subscriptions for ICT 

software, data center service, cloud computing service, 

library and other reading materials, and the like. 

 

The above errors resulted in the overstatement of Other Prepayments and 

Subscription Expenses/Accumulated Surplus by ₱1,000,000.00 and ₱2,464,657.58, 

respectively, and understatement of Prepaid Subscriptions by ₱3,464,657.58. Details

Prepayments are expenses paid before they are incurred. At the end of the 

accounting period, the expired portion shall be determined to recognize the expense 

applicable to the period being reported and a corresponding JEV shall be prepared.  

This is in conformity with the accrual basis of accounting prescribed under Section 

2(a), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM 

 

It is further noted that the Accounting Section did not maintain the necessary 

SLs for the Other Prepayments account as required by Section 114 of PD No. 1445. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the account balances for 

Other Prepayments, Prepaid Subscriptions and Subscription 

Expenses/Accumulated Surplus; and 

 

b. maintain SL for the affected accounts for monitoring and ensuring accuracy 

of balances presented in the financial statements. 

 

 

Unreliable Other Payables account balance 
 

9. The balance of the Other Payables account as of December 31, 2020 totaling 
₱6,987,091.03 could not be ascertained as to its accuracy and reliability due to the 

absence of SL or schedule to support the recorded balance, thereby, affecting the 

fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 



56 

 

 

The SL stores the details or breakdown of the balance of the controlling account 

appearing in the GL. The purpose of keeping subsidiary ledgers is for accuracy and 

efficiency. The totals of the SL balances should be reconciled with their respective 

control account regularly to ensure the accuracy of the two records. 

 

Our review of the Other Payables’ transactions in CY 2020 disclosed cash 

receipts from bidders and payable to Land Bank of the Philippines, National Library 

Employees Association, National Library Employees Cooperative for loan repayments 

deducted from salaries of employees. Further, it was noted the balance of the Other 

Payables account in 2017 to 2020 had been increasing for more or less ₱1.0 million a 

year, which could be presumed of excess or under remittance to the above mentioned 

entities. However, we could not validate the year-end balance totalling ₱6,987,091.03 

since there was no schedule to substantiate the recorded payables as the Accounting 

Section did not maintain the required SL for the account; thus, precluded the Audit 

Team from further review. 

 

Further, inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that they are in the process of 

locating the supporting documents and reconciling the account. He further explained 

that there was no proper turnover to him  from the previous Accountant. 

 

The unsubstantiated recorded payables, in addition to lack of SLs casts doubt 

on the reliability of the reported balance of Other Payables account as of year-end. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

prepare a schedule of Other Payables to support the reported balance; and 

maintain the required SL and reconcile with the GL regularly to ensure the 

accuracy of the two records.   

 

 

Overstatement of  Subsidy from NG 
 

10. Erroneous recording of the receipt of NCA for Trust Fund totaling ₱1,072,520.00 
as account Subsidy from NG instead of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust 

account resulting in the overstatement of both accounts by the same amount. 

 

Analysis of the Subsidy from NG disclosed that the receipt of NCA for Trust 

Receipts Fund was erroneously credited to the account instead of Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, in non-conformity with the provided accounting 

entries to recognize the receipt of NCA under Section 38(a), Chapter 5, Volume I of 

the GAM.  

 

The details of the NCAs for Trust Receipts Fund are shown below.  These are 

the transfer funds received from the National Commission of the Culture and the Arts, 

which were deposited to the Bureau of the Treasury and subsequently released to 

implement the projects indicated in the table below.

The above mentioned deficiency resulted in the overstatement of accounts

We recommended and Management agreed to the Accountant to prepare 

the necessary adjusting entry to reflect the correct balances of the affected 

accounts. 

 

 

Unreliable Due to BIR account balance 
 

11. The validity, accuracy and reliability of the account Due to BIR totaling 
₱4,279,599.87 could not be ascertained due to: (a) erroneous recording that 

resulted in the understatement of the account by 795,119.34 and overstatement of 

the accounts Due to GSIS and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by ₱793,119.34 and 

₱2,000.00, respectively; (b) non-submission of the necessary documents to validate 

the taxes withheld and remitted to BIR. Moreover, penalties in the total amount 

of ₱133,230.34 were incurred due late remittances of taxes withheld. 

 

Analysis of the account Due to BIR disclosed the following deficiencies:  

 

1) During the year, erroneous recording on the following transactions resulted in the 
understatement of the account by ₱795,119.34 and overstatement of Due to GSIS 

account and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by ₱793,119,34 and ₱2,000.00, 

respectively details as shown below:

Due to the absence of STWs, verification as to the correctness of the amount 

withheld and remitted to BIR could not be done.  The Audit Team verbally 

requested the documents from the Accounting Section, however they reasoned out 

that they were unable to retrieve the files from the flash drive and that there was no 

back-up files being maintained. 

 

3) Penalties amounting to ₱133,230.34 were incurred due to late remittances.  

For late filing of Tax Returns with tax due to be paid, the National Internal 

Revenue Code (NIRC) has rulings on penalties that would be imposed upon filing, 

in addition to the tax due. 

1. On Surcharge 

Sec. 248 (a) of National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). - Civil 

Penalties, provides  There shall be imposed, in addition to the tax 

required to be paid, a penalty equivalent to twenty-five percent 

(25%) of the amount due, in the following cases: xxx 

 



59 

 

2. On Interest 

Sec. 249 (a) of NIRC Interest, provides there shall be assessed and 

collected on any unpaid amount of tax, interest at the rate of 

twenty percent (20%) per annum, or such higher rate as may be 

prescribed by rules and regulations, from the date prescribed for 

payment until the amount is fully paid. 

3. On Compromise 

Sec. 255 of NIRC Failure to File Return, Supply Correct and 

Accurate Information, Pay Tax Withhold and Remit Tax and 

Refund Excess Taxes Withheld on Compensation. - Any person 

required under this Code or by rules and regulations promulgated 

thereunder to pay any tax make a return, keep any record, or 

supply correct the accurate information, who willfully fails to pay 

such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply correct 

and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or 

refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times 

required by law or rules and regulations shall, in addition to other 

penalties provided by law, upon conviction thereof, be punished 

by a fine of not less than Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00)  

 In addition, Annex A of Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 7-

2015 provides for the Revised Consolidated Schedule of Compromise Penalties for 

Violations of the NIRC. 
 

It was learned that the BIR issued several regulations on the extension of 

statutory deadlines and timeliness for the submission and/or filing of several documents 

and/or returns, as well as payment of several taxes specified in the Regulations.   The 

BIR, in consideration of the extension of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) 

period until May 15, 2020 and implementation of Modified Enhanced Community 

Quarantine in some areas until May 31, 2020, recognizes the importance of 

accessibility of payment facilities to concerned tax payer; hence, issued Revenue 

Memorandum Circular No. 48-2020 dated May 22, 2020, on the manner of accepting 

payment of Internal Revenue Taxes until June 14, 2020. 

    

The Audit Team noted that the NLP incurred delays in the remittances of taxes 

that resulted in the imposition of penalties totaling ₱133,230.34, despite the several 

extensions issued by BIR, as follows:
