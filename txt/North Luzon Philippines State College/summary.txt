On May 5, 2010, RA No. 6744 was amended by RA No. 10085 otherwise known 

as “An Act Separating the CCC-University of Northern Philippines Branch from the

NLPSC, thus, started to operate as a public higher education institution. 

 

The College is mandated to produce quality human resources for global 

competitiveness. It is committed to educate diverse learners who will become responsible 

leaders in a culturally oriented community through affordable and quality education in 

harmony with technology-based instruction, research and extension. It is spearheaded by 

Dr. Elizabeth M. Gacusana, the First President of said College. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, NLPSC had a total manpower complement of 165 which

D.  Scope of Audit 

 

 The audit covered the accounts and operations of the NLPSC, Candon City, Ilocos 

Sur for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may 

be placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. The audit was conducted 

in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 
E.  Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of NLPSC as at December 31, 2020. 

 
F.  Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 

 

The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned during the 

exit conference held on February 26, 2021, details of which are discussed in Part II of this 

report. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

 

1. The use of effectivity date of appointment as basis in computing for the payment 
of salary and bonus differentials of 23 faculty members whose ranks were 

subject of reclassification was not in accordance with Sections 17 and 23, Rule 

VI of the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource 

Actions (ORAOHRA) (Revised 2018), resulting in the overpayment of salary, 

year-end and mid-year bonus differentials, and over-remittance of government 

shares with Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), aggregating 

₱1,157,181.87. 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Human Resource Management 

Officer (HRMO) to ensure that the dates of acknowledgment of appointment, 

assumption to duties and oaths of office by appointees were the actual date such 

was undertaken and consistent with their Daily Time Records (DTRs), and to 

rectify and reconcile said documents with the date of actual return. 

Additionally, on the part of the faculty, in respect to the faculty who was on 

sabbatical leave, to rectify and reconcile said documents with the date of actual 

return with said leave. Henceforth, strictly adhere with Sections 17 and 23, Rule 

VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018). 

 

2. Past due receivables in the total amount of ₱1,308,516.30 aged three to nine 
years remained outstanding for lack of intensified collection efforts by the 

College showing a collection efficiency rate of only 1.29 percent or ₱16,780.00, 



 

 
 

resulted in deprivation by the College of much needed funds to support its 

operations. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Require the Accountant to intensify their collection efforts through 
collection and demand letters to debtors; 

 

2. Instruct the Accountant to closely monitor accounts nearing dormancy. 
After collection efforts and remedies have been exhausted on said accounts, 

request for authority to write-off dormant receivables in accordance with 

COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, and 

 

3. Consider the inclusion of collection targets in the College Key Result Areas 
and Performance Commitment to reduce its outstanding Accounts 

Receivables. 

 
G. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 

 

Of the eight audit recommendations embodied in prior years’ Annual Audit 

Reports, five were implemented, and three were not implemented. The details are presented 

in Part III of this Report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 

 

The President 

North Luzon Philippines State College 

Candon City, Ilocos Sur 

 

Opinion 

 

We have audited the financial statements of the NLPSC, Candon City, Ilocos Sur, which 

comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020 and the statement of 

financial performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, statement of cash flows, 

and statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and 

notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 

 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material 

respects, the financial position of the NLPSC as at December 31, 2020, and its financial 

performance, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in assets/equity, statement of 

comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes to the financial 

statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies in accordance with 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs). 

 

Basis for Opinion 

 

We conducted our audit in accordance with ISSAIs. Our responsibilities under those 

standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities of the Audit of the 

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the agency in accordance 

with the Revised Code Conduct and Ethical Standards for Commission on Audit Officials 

and Employees (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 

our audit of the financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other 

ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and Code of Ethics. We 

believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 

basis for our opinion. 

 

Key Audit Matters 
 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 

significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters 

were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 

forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 



 

 
 

 

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 

Financial Statements 

 

Management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance 

with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management determined as necessary to 

enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error. 

 

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the College financial 

reporting process.  

 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 

as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 

an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is high level of 

assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 

always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud 

or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably 

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 

financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 

 

1.  General Information/Agency Profile 
 

The financial statements of NLPSC were authorized for issue on February 8, 2021, as 

shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by 

Dr. Elizabeth M. Gacusana, the President. 
 

The NLPSC is a State College located at Brgy. San Nicolas, Candon City 2710. It was 

established on May 5, 2010 by RA No. 10085 otherwise known as “An Act Separating the 

University of Northern Philippines (UNP) – Candon Branch from the University of 

Northern Philippines in the City of Vigan, Ilocos Sur”.  NLPSC has its roots from a small 

community college that was known as CCC established in 1975. On August 11, 1989, CCC 

was integrated into the UNP by RA No. 6744 as CCC-UNP which later came to be more 

popularly known as UNP – Candon Branch.  After almost 21 years, CCC-UNP was again 

separated from the UNP to become what is no known as NLPSC.  
 

The NLPSC envisions to produce quality human resources for global competitiveness. It 

is committed to educate diverse learners who will become responsible leaders in a 

culturally-oriented community through affordable and quality education in harmony with 

technology-based instruction, research and extension. 

 

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements 
 

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the 

IPSAS issued by the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated 

January 24, 2014. 
 

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated 

otherwise and presented in Philippine Peso. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using 

the direct method.  
 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1.  Basis of Accounting  
 

The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with 

the IPSAS. 

 

The College derives funds for its operations from different fund sources, as follows: 

 
Sources of Funds Fund Book 

Regular Agency Fund (GAA) Fund 01 (GF – 101) 

Internally Generated Funds (Use of Income) Fund 05 (UI – 164) 

Business Related Funds (Income Generating Projects) Fund 06 (IGP – 161) 

Trust Receipts Fund 07 (TF – 184)

3.2. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand, which could either be Cash-

Collecting Officer or Petty Cash Fund, and cash in bank which could either be a 

Modified Disbursement Scheme (MDS) Account or a Local Currency, Current 

Account (LCCA) Account. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash 

flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  

 

3.3. Inventories 
 

Inventories are measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory 

was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal cost), 

the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 

 

After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable 

value. Cost is measured using the Weighted Average Cost Method while Net 

realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of operations, 

less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the 

sale, exchange, or distribution.   

  

Inventories are recognized as an expense when issued for utilization or consumption 

in the ordinary course of operations of the NLPSC. 

 

3.4. Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
 

Recognition 

 

An item is recognized as PPE if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria 

as a PPE.  

 

The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

 Tangible items; 

 Held for use in the production or supply of goods and services, for rental 
to others, or for administrative purposes; and 

 Expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 

 It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the item will flow to the College; and 

 The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 

Measurement at Recognition 

 

It is initially measured at cost at date of acquisition. A PPE acquired through non-

exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. The 



 

11 
 

cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or for PPE acquired through non-exchange 

transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date. 

 

Cost includes the following: 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 

 initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for  which an entity 

incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having 

used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce 

inventories during that period. 

 

Measurement After Recognition 

 

After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 

impairment losses. 

 

When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the NLPSC 

recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates 

them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is 

recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 

recognition criteria are satisfied. 

  

All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit 

as incurred. 

 

Depreciation 

 

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included 

in the cost of another asset. 

 

Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the 

location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 

intended by management. 

 

For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one 

month and depreciation will start on the succeeding month after issuance to the end-

user. 

 

Depreciation Method 

 

The NLPSC adopted the straight-line method of depreciation. 

 



 

12 
 

Estimated Useful Life 

 

The NLPSC is guided by the Schedule of Estimated Life of PPE by classification 

prepared by COA.  

 

It also uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost of PPE. 

 

Impairment 
 

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or recoverable 

service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 

recoverable service amount. 

 

Derecognition 

 

The NLPSC derecognizes items of PPE and/or significant part of an asset upon 

disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from 

its continuing use.  The derecognized items of PPEs are the reclassified as Other 

Assets and any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 

difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is 

included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized.  

 

3.5. Intangible Assets 
 

Recognition and Measurement 
 

Intangible assets are recognized when the items are identifiable non-monetary assets 

without physical substance; it is probable that the expected future economic benefits 

or service potential that are attributable to the assets will flow to the entity; and the 

cost or fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.  

 

Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost.  

 

If payment for an intangible asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its cost is 

the cash price equivalent.  The difference between this amount and the total payment 

is recognized as interest expense over the period of credit unless capitalized in 

accordance with the capitalization treatment. 

   

Subsequent Measurement 
 

The useful life of the intangible asset is assessed as either finite or indefinite.  

Intangible asset with a finite life is amortized over its useful life.  
 

The straight-line method is adopted in the amortization of the expected pattern of 

consumption of the expected future economic benefits or service potential. 
 



 

13 
 

An intangible asset with indefinite useful lives was not amortized. Intangible assets 

with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use were 

assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the asset may be 

impaired. 
 

The amortization period and the amortization method, for an intangible asset with a 

finite useful life, were reviewed at the end of each reporting period.  Changes in the 

expected useful life or pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied 

in the asset were considered to modify the amortization period or method, as 

appropriate, and were treated as changes in accounting estimates.  The amortization 

expense in an intangible asset with a finite useful life is recognized in surplus or 

deficit as expense category that is consistent with the nature of the intangible asset.  
 

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset were measured as 

the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 

and were recognized in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized. 
 

Following initial recognition, intangible assets were carried at cost less any 

accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. 

 

3.6. Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions  
 

Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions  
 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset is 

recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized in respect 

of the same inflow.  
 

Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange Transactions  

  

The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the best 

estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. 

 

Gifts and Donations 

  

The NLPSC recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations when it is 

probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity 

and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably. 

 

If goods in-kind were received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized 

immediately. On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were 

measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained by 

reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of the value of an asset is 

normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized 

and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair values were 

ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market. 

 



 

14 
 

Transfers  
  
The NLPSC recognizes an asset in respect of transfers when the transferred resources 

meet the definition of an asset and satisfy the criteria for recognition as an asset, 

except those arising from services in-kind. 

 

Transfers from Other Government Entities  
  
Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and the 

related assets are measured at fair value and recognized on obtaining control of the 

asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the transfer is free from conditions and 

it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential related to the asset will 

flow to the NLPSC and can be measured reliably. 

 

3.7. Revenue from Exchange Transactions 
 

Measurement of Revenue 
 

Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. 

 

Rendering of Services  

 

The NLPSC recognizes revenue from rendering services by reference to the start of 

the semester for which the tuition fees are collected. Other school fees are recognized 

as revenue upon receipt of payment. 

 

Sale of Unserviceable Properties  

 

Revenue from the sale of unserviceable properties is recognized when the significant 

risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery 

of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is 

probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the 

transaction will flow to the College. 

 

Rental Income  

 

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted 

for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in revenue. 

 

  Budget Information 

 

The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the NLPSC website. 
 

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) was 

prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on 

comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final budget 



 

15 
 

and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget. Explanatory comments 

are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements. 

 

The annual budget figures included in the financial statements were solely for the 

NLPSC as it has no controlled entities. These budget figures were those approved by 

the governing body both at the beginning and during the year following a period of 

consultation with the public. 

 

3.8. Impairment of Non-Cash Generating Assets 
 

The NLPSC assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a non-

cash generating asset may be impaired. If any indication exists or when an annual 

impairment testing is required, the NLPSC estimates the asset’s recoverable service 

amount.  An asset’s recoverable service amount is the higher of the non-cash 

generating asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 

 

When the carrying amount of an assets exceeds its recoverable service amount, the 

asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable service amount.  

The NLPSC classifies assets as cash–generating assets when those assets were held 

with the primary objective of generating a commercial return. Therefore, non-cash 

generating assets would be those assets from which the NLPSC does not intend (as 

its primary objective) to realize a commercial return. 

 

3.9. Related parties  
 

The NLPSC regards a related party as a person or an entity with the ability to exert 

control, individually or jointly, or to exercise significant influence over the College, 

or vice versa.  
  

Members of key management were regarded as related parties and   comprise the 

Chair and the Members of the Board of Trustees. 

 

3.10. Employee Benefits 
 

The employees of the NLPSC are members of the GSIS, which provide life and 

retirement insurance coverage.  

 

The NLPSC recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits, 

like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, etc., as expense unless capitalized, and as 

a liability after deducting the amount paid. 

 

The NLPSC recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when 

these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). Unused entitlements 

that have accumulated at the reporting date were not recognized as expense. Non-

accumulating compensated absences, like special leave privileges, were not 

recognized. 

 



 

16 
 

3.11. Measurement Uncertainty 
 

The preparation of financial statement in conformity with the IPSAS, requires 

management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of 

assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of 

the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses 

during the period. Items requiring use of significant estimates include useful life of 

capital assets, estimated employee benefits, rates for amortization, impairment of 

assets, and estimated uncollectible accounts, etc. 

 

Estimates were based on the best information available at the time of preparation of 

the financial statements and were reviewed annually to reflect new information as it 

becomes available.  Measurement uncertainty exists in these financial statements. 

Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

 

3.12. Changes in Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  

The NLPSC recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. 

The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if 

retrospective application is impractical. 

  

It recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates prospectively by 

including it in the surplus or deficit.

OBSERVATIONS AND 

RECOMMENDATIONS

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Compliance Audit 
 

Invalid Payments of Salary and Bonus Differentials of Faculty - ₱1,157,181.87 

 

1. The use of effectivity date of appointment as basis in computing for the payment 
of salary and bonus differentials of 23 faculty members whose ranks were subject 

of reclassification was not in accordance with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 

2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), resulting in the overpayment of salary, year-end 

and mid-year bonus differentials, and over-remittance of government shares with 

GSIS, aggregating ₱1,157,181.87. 

 

Section 17, Rule VI, of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised July 2018) provides, 

among others, to wit: 

 

1. If the appointee has taken his/her oath of office and assumed 
the duties of position, he/she shall be entitled to receive 

his/her salary at once without awaiting the 

approval/validation of his/her appointment by the 

Commissio[n]. 

 

 Xxx. 

  

2. The appointment of officials or employees who are on 
official leave of absence, training or scholarship grant, shall 

be effective upon assumption or upon return from official 

leave of absence, scholarship or training. 

 

Moreover, Section 23 of the same Rule states:  

 

The date of the actual assumption of duties of the appointees, as 

indicated in the Certification of Assumption to Duty (CS Form 

No. 4, Series of 2017), shall be the basis for the payment of 

his/her salary and determination of service rendered in the 

government[t]. 

 

Xxx. 

 

Records showed that 23 faculty members were granted salary and year-end 

bonus differentials covering the period July 1, 2019 to January 12, 2020 as a result of 

the reclassification/modification of their positions per DBM NBC No. 461 – Seventh 

Evaluation. Said reclassification/modification was covered under DBM Notice of 

Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) with Serial No. 0102020-



 

28 
 

01-001 dated January 7, 2020 stating therein that Organization, Staffing Position and/or 

Compensation modifications were approved and effective not earlier than July 1, 2019.  

 

 On the Clarification on the Effectivity Date of Appointments in State 

Universities and Colleges based on the Implementation of DBM NBC No. 461, Civil 

Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 2000052 dated January 21, 2020 was 

issued which provides in the dispositive portion thereof the following: 

 

Xxx, the Commission RESOLVES that the actual date of 

issuance of appointments shall be indicated below the signature 

of the appointing officer/authority in the appointment form, but 

the effectivity of reclassification to faculty positions in the SUCs 

shall be on July 1, 2019 based on the implementation of NBC 

No. 461 pursuant to the Special Provision of the Miscellaneous 

Personnel Benefits Fund in R.A. No. 10924.  

Xxx. 

 

Audit of payrolls and its supporting documents, and verification of all 

appointees’ DTRs for the month of January 12, 2020 disclosed that the reckoning/cut-

off date used in computing for such salary adjustments was “July 1, 2019,” the 

effectivity date of reclassification stated in said CSC Resolution, instead of, “January 

13, 2020,” the date of actual assumption of duties and oaths of office taken and/or upon 

return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training per Sections 17 and 23, 

Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018). The appointments, certificates of 

assumption and oaths of office of the 23 subject faculty were all dated January 13, 

2021. 

 

Between the dates laid down in CSC Resolution No. 2000052 and Sections 17 

and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA, the Audit Team is of the stand/interpretation, 

however, that the date per Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA should 

prevail and be the basis for the payment of salary. After all, CSC Resolution No. 

2000052 provides only for the date given to SUCs to effect reclassification/ 

modification to faculty positions and not to be construed, otherwise.   

 

Further review showed, that of the 23 appointees, 22 appointees were actually 

present on January 12, 2020, whereas, one appointee was on sabbatical leave for one 

year effective August 5, 2019 until August 4, 2020.  However, it was reflected in his 

Oath of Office and Certificate of Assumption to Duty that the taking of oath of office 

and assumption to duties and acknowledgment of appointment were all undertaken on 

January 13, 2020 in the absence of a supporting evidence/document that his actual 

return from such was cut short as required under par. 2 of Section 17, Rule VI, 2017 

ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), casting doubt on the validity of the date of actual 

assumption.  

 

Above-deficiencies were inconsistent with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 

2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), resulting in the overpayment of salary and year-end 



 

29 
 

bonus differentials, net of withholding tax in the total amount of ₱892,530.75. As to 

the appointee who was on sabbatical leave for the period August 5, 2019 to August 4, 

2020, the computed overpayment of salary and Mid-year Bonus, net of withholding 

tax, and government’s shares in RLIP with the GSIS for the period January 13, 2020 to 

July 31, 2020 aggregated to ₱264,651.12.  

 

Summary of overpayments of ₱1,157,181.87 is shown hereunder:

Grand Total   1,157,181.87 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the HRMO to ensure that the 

dates of acknowledgment of appointment, assumption to duties and oaths of office 

by appointees were the actual dates such were undertaken and consistent with 

their DTRs, and to rectify and reconcile said documents with the date of actual 

return. Additionally, in respect to the faculty who was on sabbatical leave, to 

rectify and reconcile said documents with the date of actual return with said leave. 

Henceforth, strictly adhere with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 

ORAOHRA (Revised 2018). 

 

Management commented that CSC, in its Resolution No. 2000052, was 

premised under Special Provision No. 3 of the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits fund 

(MPBF) in RA 10924 (General Appropriations Act of 2019) which stated that the 

amount appropriated for the implementation of NBC No. 461 shall be used solely for 

the said purpose effective July 1, 2019, and in its operative clause, it was recommended 

therein that a colatilla shall be indicated on the face of the appointment. As such, it was 

interpreted by the College as the effectivity date of the subject faculty’s reclassification 

and basis of paying for their salary differentials. It was further claimed that the 

reckoning date used was the same date used by other SUCs in the Philippines, and the 

Letter of the DBM approving the request of the College on the release of Special 

Allotment Release Order and Notice of Cash Allocation for the payment of salary and 

year-end bonus differentials for the period July1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 has 

strengthened the claim of the 23 faculty members that they are entitled to salary 

differential effective July 1, 2019. 

 

During the exit conference, the President explained that before the preparation 

of the payment of said salary differential, the Accountant informed the concerned 

faculty members that the date of effectivity of their appointment should be January 13, 

2020. However, they insisted that they follow July 1, 2019 as effectivity date as per 

CSC Resolution. It was further informed that subject faculty even issued waivers 

stating their willingness to pay in case it will be subjected to disallowance in the future.  

 



 

30 
 

The Audit Team informed Management that it maintains its stand with its audit 

recommendations. Further, it was also informed that a Notice of Disallowance (ND) 

will be issued on said transactions in which they have the privilege to file for an appeal 

with the Regional Director of COA. 

 

 

Non-Conduct of Materials Testing - ₱7,738,650.88 

 

2. Materials used in the implementation of eight Infrastructure Projects of the 
College with an aggregate cost of ₱7,738,650.88 were not subjected to test analysis 

which was in violation of Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, Item 11.1 

of Annex E of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 

No. 9184 and Item B.3 of Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) 

Department Order (DO) No. 197 s. 2016, casting doubt on the quality of materials 

used. 

 

Materials testing is one of the quality control standards in the construction of 

infrastructure projects in order to achieve high quality structures. It is to be emphasized 

that the safety of the people enjoying these projects should not be compromised with 

the use of sub-standard quality of materials. Although disasters, natural or man-made, 

are inevitable, use of quality materials could at least give guarantee that it can stand 

the impact of such or would bear lesser damages compared to using materials which 

have not undergone test analysis. 

 

As to construction/repair/rehabilitation of buildings/canals and other similar 

structures, the following applicable tests are required: 

 

1. Cement 
2. Aggregates (Fine and Coarse) 
3. Steel Frames 
4. Reinforcing Steel Bars  
5. Concrete Hollow Blocks (CHB) 
6. Compressive Strength/Flexural Test (for concrete) 

 

Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2020 requires the 

submission of Results of Test Analysis during progress/final payments, among others. 

 

Item 11.1, Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 states: 
  

To help ensure the quality of materials being used in 

infrastructure projects, the Bureau of Research and Standards 

(BRS) of the DPWH, Department of Science and Technology 

(DOST), or Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) shall 

accredit, in accordance with industry guidelines, the testing 

laboratories whose services are engaged or to be engaged in 

infrastructure projects. All government infrastructure project 



 

31 
 

owners must accept results of material test(s) coming only 

from DOST/BRS accredited laboratories. 

 

In the preparation of the Approved Budget of the Contract (ABC), Item B.3 of 

DPWH D.O. No. 197, S. 2016 states: 
 

Miscellaneous Expenses – ranges from 0.5 to 1% of the EDC. 

These include laboratory tests for quality control and plan 

preparation. 
 

Based from the guidelines in the preparation of the ABC, it is composed of 

Direct Cost and Indirect Cost where Indirect Cost consists of Overhead Expenses, 

Contingencies, and Miscellaneous Expenses (OCM), Contractor’s Profit Margin and 

VAT component. Miscellaneous Expenses under OCM include the conduct of 

laboratory tests for quality control and plan preparation. 
 

Post audit of progress and final payments of eight infrastructure projects of the 

College with an aggregate cost of ₱7,738,650.88 disclosed that such were not 

supported with applicable Results of Materials Test Analysis. Details are shown in the

Submission of applicable Results of Test Analysis was requested from 

Management, but to no avail. Evidently, concerned contractors did not subject the 

materials used in the construction of the Projects to laboratory test analysis which was 

in violation of Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, Item 11.1 of Annex E of 

The 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 and Item B.3 of DPWH DO No. 197 s. 2016, 

casting doubt in the quality of materials used. 
 

We recommended that Management instruct the Planning Officer to 

require contractors to submit results of materials test analysis conducted by duly 

accredited Testing Laboratories in compliance with Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular 

No. 2012-001, Item 11.1, Annex “E” of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No.  9184 and 

Item B.3 of DPWH DO No. 197 s. 2016. 
 

During the exit conference, the Planning Officer claimed that only materials for 

major projects were to be subjected to test analysis since based from the DPWH, there 

are schedule of minimum testing requirements as to quantity of materials for it to be 

subjected to materials testing.  
 

However, the Audit Team stated that the College is not precluded to require the 

contractor/s the applicable materials for test analysis to ensure the quality of materials 

used for projects and since it was programmed in the OCM, such needs to be utilized. 
 

In their comments, Management committed to ensure the quality of materials 

to be used and have already instructed the Planning Officer to require the submission 

of result of material test analysis conducted by duly accredited laboratories for the 

succeeding projects of the College. 

 

 

Non-remittance of Excess Bidders Fee to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) 

 

3. Accumulated balance of Bidders Fee representing proceeds from sale of bid 
documents net of honoraria and other charges aggregating ₱257,744.45 was not 

remitted to the BTr, which was not in adherence to Section 6.2 of DBM Budget 

Circular No. 2004-5A, depriving the Government of additional funds to support 

its operations. 
 

Section 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 

provides: 

 

Pursuant to the DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee 

Resolution No. 2005-2 dated June 2005, all agencies are 



 

33 
 

authorized to treat the collections from the sources identified in 

item 6.1 hereof as trust receipts to be used exclusively for the 

payment of honoraria and overtime pay herein authorized. 

Agencies may utilize up to one hundred percent (100%) of the 

said collections for the payment of honoraria and overtime pay 

subject to the guidelines in item 5.0 of this Circular. Any excess 

in the amount collected shall be remitted by NGAs to the Bureau 

of the Treasur[y]. 

 

Collections arising from the proceeds from sale of bid documents were treated 

by the College in the books of accounts as Trust Liabilities under Bidders Fee account. 

 

 As at December 31, 2020, Bidders Fee account showed an outstanding balance 

of ₱257,744.45 which comprised the accumulated balance of proceeds from sale of bid 

documents after payment of honoraria to the Bids and Awards Committee Members 

and Technical Working Group and other charges in CY 2020 and previous years. 

 

Based from available data gathered, said accumulated balance of Bidders Fee 

covering the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 accumulated to ₱257,744.45 as of December 

31, 2020, as presented in the table below:

Non-remittance of the excess of the proceeds from the sale of bid documents 

net of honoraria and other charges totaling ₱257,744.45 to the BTr at the end of the year 

was not in accordance with Section 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A, 

depriving the Government of additional funds to support its operations. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to remit to the 

BTr the accumulated balance of proceeds from sale of bid documents in the total 

amount of ₱257,744.45 as prescribed under Section 6.2 DBM Budget Circular No. 

2004-5A. 

 

Management committed to remit the accumulated balance of proceeds from sale 

of bid documents to the BTr. 

 

During the exit conference, Management informed the Audit Team that there 

was still an unpaid honorarium for one project awarded in 2020 in which the Audit 

Team replied that the accumulated balance reported already excluded such unclaimed 

honoraria.

Non-disposal of Unserviceable Property and Equipment - ₱495,613.53 

 

4. Thirty units of unserviceable property and equipment with a total net book value 
of ₱495,613.53 recorded under the Other Assets account were not disposed, 

contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, hence may result in 

their further deterioration thus, enabling the College to have better chance of 

recovery of their residual values, if found valuable.   

 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the “Government Auditing 

Code of the Philippines” provides that: 

 

When government property has become unserviceable for any 

cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 

officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of 

the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence 

of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or 

unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be 

valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder 

under the supervision of the proper committee an award or 

similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other 

duly authorized representative of the Commission, after 

advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not 

less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general 

circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant 

the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in 

at least three public places in the locality where the property is 

to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property 

may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the 

same committee or body concerned and approved by the 

Commission. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the balance of Other Assets account amounted to 

₱495,613.53. Verification of its supporting schedules showed that said balance 

represents the total net book value of 30 units of unserviceable property and equipment 

composed of office equipment, information and communication technology 

equipment, furniture and fixtures and motor vehicle which were not disposed of during 

the year.  

 

Non-disposal by Management of its unserviceable property was not in 

conformity with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, hence, may result in their further 

deterioration thus, enabling the College to have better chance of recovery of their 

residual values, if found valuable.  

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Property Officer to 

dispose unserviceable property pursuant to Section 79 of PD No. 1445. 

 



 

35 
 

In their comments, the College committed to dispose the said properties and 

equipment indicating its target period for every activity of the disposal process. 

Completion of such is expected until July 2021. 

 

During the exit conference, the Property Officer informed the Audit Team that 

the list of all unserviceable properties of the College including properties recognized 

unserviceable as of February 10, 2021 were already finalized and that they have 

requested the inspection of those to be conducted by the College Appraisal Team before 

submitting pertinent documents to COA for inspection by the Regional Technical 

Evaluation Services. 

 

 

B. Performance Audit 
 

Low Collection Efficiency Rate of Past Due Receivables - ₱1,308,516.30 

 

5. Past due receivables in the total amount of ₱1,308,516.30 aged three to nine years 
remained outstanding for lack of intensified collection efforts by the College 

showing a collection efficiency rate of only 1.29 percent or ₱16,780.00, which 

resulted in deprivation by the College of much needed funds to support its 

operations. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, Accounts Receivable (A/R) has a reported balance 

of ₱1,282,516.30 under Fund 164 (Use of Income) aged three to nine years and 

₱26,000.00 for Fund 161 (Income Generating Projects Fund) aged more than 

three years totaling ₱1,308,516.30.  

 

A/R under Fund 164 represents unpaid tuition fees of students who did not 

continue with their studies or dropped out their subjects without informing the College 

covering SYs 2011-2012 to 2016-2017 while A/R under Fund 161 represents 

unpaid rentals on account of four lessees of stalls. 

  

Based from data on collections gathered for the CYs 2017-2020, the 

collection efficiency rate significantly dropped from 39.09 per cent in CY 2017 to 1.29 

percent in CY 2020, the lowest since CY 2017, as presented in the table below:

2020 1,299,296.30 16,780.00   1 

 

As for Fund 161 (Income Generating Projects Fund), no collection was made 

during CY 2020. 

  



 

36 
 

Inquiry from the Accountant disclosed that low collection of receivables may 

be attributed to their inability to send demand letters during CY 2020 whereas in the 

previous years, demand letters were regularly served. 

 

Lack of intensified collection efforts by the College resulted in the deprivation 

by the College of much needed funds to support its operations. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Require the Accountant to intensify collection efforts through 
collection and demand letters to debtors; 

 

2. Instruct the Accountant to closely monitor accounts nearing dormancy. 
After collection efforts and remedies have been exhausted on said 

accounts, request authority to write-off dormant receivables in 

accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, 

and 

 

3. Consider the inclusion of collection targets in the College Key Result 
Areas and Performance Commitment to reduce its outstanding 

Accounts Receivables 

 

In their comments, Management committed to intensify its collection efforts 

and implement audit recommendations. The Accounting Office together with the 

Internal Generating Project Unit will send demand letters to debtors this CY 2021 and 

closely monitor accounts nearing dormancy. 

 

During the exit conference, the Accountant informed the Audit Team that they 

omitted to serve demand letters in CY 2020. The Audit Team then reminded 

Management to monitor those account that will age 10 years this CY 2021 and if 

warranted, to request for authority to write-off.  Further, the Accountant stated that 

collection targets on these receivables were included in her Office Performance 

Commitment Rating while the SUC President agreed to include such in the College 

Key Result Areas and Performance Commitment.   

 

 

C. Other Areas 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

6. GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) was not modified to address the COVID-19 situation 
and non-establishment of GAD database/sex-disaggregated data were not in 

accordance with Section 1 of EO 273, Section 32 of GAA of FY 2020, Sections 

4.2,4.3, 8.6.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 and Sections 

4.1 and 4.4 of PCW Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-03, resulting in only 

2.06 percent GPB utilization, thus, effective implementation of GAD projects and 



 

37 
 

activities responsive to gender issues and development of the College and 

stakeholders could not be assured. 

 

Section 1 of EO No. 273 dated September 8, 1995 directs all government 

agencies, departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities to take appropriate steps 

to ensure the full implementation of the policies/strategies and programs/projects 

outlined in the Plan and to institutionalize GAD efforts in government by incorporating 

GAD concerns, as spelled out in the Plan; in their dated planning, programming 

budgeting processes. 

 

Section 32, of the GAA of FY 2020 requires all agencies of the government to 

formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors 

and or mandate and implement applicable provisions under RA 9710 or the Magna 

Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 

Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender 

Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-

2022) 
 

PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 prescribes guidelines and procedures for 

the formulation, development, submission, implementation, monitoring and evaluation 

including accounting of results of agency annual GPBs, and GAD Accomplishment 

Report, applicable provisions are the following: 
 

4.0 The following are essential elements in GAD planning and 

budgeting as they enable agencies to more effectively plan 

and implement their sectoral programs on GAD. If these are 

not present or need to be strengthened, agencies shall include 

them in their GPBs: 
  

xxx 

 

4.2 Capacity Building on Gender and Development. [A]gencies 

are required to regularly undertake orientations and capacity 

development on GAD including GAD-related laws and 

commitments for their employees. Training should include 

gender mainstreaming, gender analysis and gender-

responsive planning and budgeting. 
 

 xxx 

 

4.3 Institutionalizing GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data: 

The agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database 

GAD information to include gender statistics and sex-

disaggregated data that have been systematically produced 

or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, 

programming, and policy formation. 
 



 

38 
 

8.6 PCW shall endorse agency GPBs only under the following 

conditions: 

 

xxx 

 

8.6.2 if the requested revisions or additional information in 

answer to questions about the GPB are accepted by 

PCW within the prescribed deadlines; 

 

xxx 

 

Meanwhile, Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of PCW MC No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 

prescribes: 
 

4.1 All national government agencies and instrumentalities are 
enjoined to review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 

Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget to 

implement measures to address gender issues and concerns 

arising from the unequal status of their women and men 

stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situatio[n]. 

 

xxx 

 

4.4 Agencies with FY 2020 GPB that has been endorsed or is 

still under review by the PCW have an option to submit 

adjusted GPB until 01 July 2020 for re-endorsement of 

PC[W]. 

 

Audit of the College relative to its GAD planning formulation, submission and 

implementation during the CY 2020 disclosed the following: 

 

1. Non-modification of the GPB of the College to address gender issues and 
concerns during the COVID-19 situation as required under Sections 4.1 and 

4.4 of PCW MC No. 2020-03 prevented the optimum implementation and 

utilization of GPB as only 2.06 percent or ₱105,295.00 was incurred. 

 

Review of the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) showed that non-

implementation of most GAD activities/programs in the GPB such as 

trainings/seminars, colloquiums with student leaders and faculty, due to 

limited movement, work from home arrangement and absence of face to 

face classes brought about by the pandemic situation and GAD Director was 

on maternity leave for three and a half months during the year, depriving 

the intended beneficiaries of benefits derived therefrom.  

 

2. Absence of GAD database/established sex disaggregated data essential in 
GAD planning, budgeting, programming and policy formulation as required 

in Section 4.3 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. 



 

39 
 

Sex-disaggregated data consists of information collected and analyzed 

separately on males and females stored in the College GAD database which 

shall be updated, as needed and used in the preparation of the annual GPB 

and accomplishment reports, and used in their policy and program 

development. 

 

In the review of GAD AR, one of the GAD activities to be implemented 

during the year under the Organization-Focused Activities is the installation 

of GAD database for students and employees wherein it needs to hire a 

computer expert to do the task of creating a GAD database, but such was 

not implemented which was not in conformity with PCW-NEDA-DBM JC 

No. 2012-01. 

 

Non-revision of GPB to address issues and concerns during pandemic and 

absence of GAD database/established sex disaggregated data resulted in the low 

utilization of GAD Budget, thus, there was no assurance that the projects and activities 

carried out fully addressed gender issues of the College and its stakeholders, 

inconsistent with Section 1 of EO No. 273 and Section 32, of the GAA of FY 2020.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Strictly comply with Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 8.6 PCW-NEDA-DBM JC 
No. 2012-01 and Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of PCW MC No. 2020-03, 

 

2. Direct the GAD Focal Point the following: 
 

a) See to it that necessary revisions of the GPB required by the PCW 
be made and re-submitted timely for endorsement by the PCW, and 

 

b) Ensure full implementation/utilization of the GPB to efficiently and 
effectively address gender issues and concerns. 

 

Management committed to implement our audit recommendations.

aggregate contract cost of 

₱4,666,145.64 were split, in 

violation of Section 54.1 of 

The 2016 Revised IRR of RA

the legality of the 

transactions. 

 

2. We recommended that 
Management, 

henceforth, direct the 

BAC to strictly comply 

with Section 54.1 of The 

2016 Revised IRR of RA 

No. 9184 and warned 

that violation thereof will 

be dealt with accordingly

instead of, the lowest rated 

calculated and responsive 

quotation which was not in 

conformity with Item 8.b.vi, 

Section IV of Annex “H” of 

The 2016 Revised IRR of 

RA 9184, resulting in price 

difference of ₱338,110.00, 

casting doubt on the legality 

of   the transaction.
