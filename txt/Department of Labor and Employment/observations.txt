PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors, Omissions and Misstatements 

 

1. The DOLE’s consolidated financial statements (FSs) were misstated by 
₱46,322,646.30, which is below the materiality threshold of ₱79,771,250.95 or 

two percent of the total current operating expenses of ₱3,988,562,547.26 for an 

expense-driven entity. 

 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, requires that the “FSs 

shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash 

flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of 

the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with 

the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(PPSAS)1.  The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if 

necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.” 

 

1.2 Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides the following: 
 

1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to 
meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to 

furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 

government.  

 

2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 

misleading information. 

 

1.3 In the audit of the various accounts of the DOLE, the following 
misstatements/errors were noted in the reported total Assets and Liabilities 

of the Agency as at December 31, 2020.

adjusted in the books of DOLE during the audit period, amounted to 

₱46,322,646.30. This amount is below the established materiality threshold 

of ₱79,771,250.95 or two percent of the total current operating expenses 

totaling ₱3,988,562,547.26 of the DOLE. Details of the uncorrected 

misstatements are presented per account in the succeeding paragraphs.

1.6 Details of deficiencies were discussed below: 
 

a) Non-restoration of stale checks 
 

1.7 Paragraph 5.0 of Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017 
provides the transitory provisions, that Modified Disbursement System 

(MDS) checks to be issued starting January 2, 2018 shall already indicate 

“valid for three months from date of issue”. 

 

1.8 Pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I are as follows: 
 

 Section 44, Chapter 6 states that the depository bank considers a check 
stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or 

as prescribed.  

 

 Section 56, Chapter 19 provides that all unreleased checks at the end of 
the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. A Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV) shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash 

equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate 

liability/ payable account. 

 

1.9 Review and analysis of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) 
disclosed the existence of stale checks in ROs II, VI, and IX totaling 

₱1,186,916.72, which remained unadjusted as at year-end. 

 

b) Unadjusted reconciling items 
 

1.10 In RO VI, there are unrecorded additions to the book balance totaling 
₱7,517.87 which pertains to erroneous entries/recording of transactions 

from CYs 2014 and 2016, and deductions totaling ₱69,515.91 which 

pertains to adjustments for stale checks and erroneous recording of 

transactions, some of which transpired in CY 2014. 

 



88 
 

1.11 While in RO VIII, the unrecognized reconciling items totaling ₱516,997.99 
pertain to unrecorded fund transfers and prior years’ transactions, and 

erroneous recording. 

 

c) Unrecorded interest income 
 

1.12 Review of the schedules attached to the BRS of RO VI showed unrecorded 
interest income in its Inter-fund Transfer account (CA#0755-009-468-030) 

and Trust Fund (DBP CA#0755-009-465-030) in the amount of ₱1,850.04 

and ₱3,120.22, respectively. 

 

d) Non-restoration of unreleased checks 
 

1.13 For CY 2020, the Cashier of RO VIII reported unreleased checks totaling 
₱1,557,492.13 under the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) trust account. 

 

1.14 However, a review of the RO’s General Journals disclosed that there were 
no adjusting journal entries for the restoration of unreleased checks, and the 

appropriate liability account was not recognized.  

 

1.15 It was revealed in an inquiry from the Accountant that the Cashier did not 
provide her the report of unreleased checks as of December 31, 2020, 

resulting in non-preparation of the JEV. Hence, the year-end balances of 

assets, liabilities, and expenses are not fairly presented. 

 

e) Unadjusted misstatements from prior year’s audit report 
 

1.16 Validation of prior years’ audit recommendations showed the following 
misstatements which were not yet adjusted/corrected in the books:

CO 

 

545,293.13 

 

Non-recording of various cash and check deposits IV-B 241,326.00 

 

1.17 The non-adjustments of the above rendered the Cash account overstated by 
₱303,967.13, net of understatement. This prior year’s observation was 

presented in Part III of this Report. 

 

1.18 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
Accountants of the concerned Offices to recognize all reconciling items 

in the BRSs that require adjustment/correction in the books of accounts 

and revert back to Cash accounts all unreleased and stale checks.  



89 
 

1.19 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

CO The Management committed to submit the BRS and JEV for the 

required adjustment. 

II The Management committed to implement the audit 

recommendations accordingly. 

VI During the Exit Conference, the Accountant informed that the 

necessary adjustments will be booked this 1st and 2nd Quarter of 

CY 2021. 

VIII The Accountant commented during the Exit Conference that the 

reconciling items were already adjusted in October 2020. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The adjustments made by the Accountant per JEV Nos. RA-20-

10-0279 to 0282 dated October 31, 2020 totaling ₱73,057.50 

pertaining to SAP 1 and 2 accounts were without supporting 

documents. In addition, latest BRSs submitted to COA as of 

December 31, 2020 for the mentioned accounts were only up to 

September 2020. 

IX Management committed to monitor the stale checks per BRS 

starting January 2021 and prepare the necessary adjusting entries 

for the ₱70,150.60. 

 

 

RECEIVABLES 

 

1.20 The balance of Receivables account as of December 31, 2020 is misstated

₱14,220,284.74 was recorded in the books per various JEVs for CYs 2019 

to 2020, and ₱120,527.58 was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr.) 

per records of the PS-DBM, thus, leaving a balance of unrecorded deliveries 

of ₱15,246.21.

b) Unrecognized receivables in the books for the unclaimed financial 
assistance 

 

1.23 Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III defines Other Receivables as an 
account used to recognize amount due from debtors and other agencies not 

falling under any of the specific receivable account. This also includes 

receivables from individuals or entities intended for specific projects or 

purpose not falling under any of the specific receivable account. Credit this 

account for payment/liquidation of receivables.

2. The validity of the fund in FIRST PARTY account is only for 

a period of 90 days from the date the remittance was processed by 

the Second Party. In the event that the beneficiaries failed to claim 

their salaries within the first 30 days of the validity period, the 

FIRST PARTY shall inform and provide the SECOND PARTY of 

the list of the beneficiaries with unclaimed remittance within 5 days 

from the last days of the first 30 days. The SECOND PARTY shall 

notify the FIRST PARTY for an extension of another 30 days 

within 15 days from receipt of then notification and list of 

unclaimed remittances. Any unclaimed remittances within 30-day 

extension from date of receipt (sic) of the notice of extension by the 

FIRST PARTY, the latter shall return the unclaimed amount in 

check through the SECOND PARTY in Zamboanga City together 

with the list of the beneficiaries within 5 days from the date of 

expiry of the 30-day extension. 

 

1.25 Audit in RO IX disclosed that the total amount of ₱504,271.20 was not 
recognized as Other Receivables as of December 31, 2020, which pertained 

to the program funds that remained unclaimed by the intended beneficiaries 

and at the possession of the MLFSI, the Money Remittance Center (MRC) 

commissioned by the said RO for the distribution of the financial assistance 

to the beneficiaries of the AKAP 1, SPES, TUPAD, GIP.  

 

1.26 The unclaimed program funds aged beyond the 90-day holding period is due 
for return by MLFSI in accordance with Item 2, Section M of the MOA 

entered into by the parties. 

 

1.27 We recommended and the Management agreed to direct the 
Accountant of RO IX to prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries 

to recognize Other Receivables and disclose in the Notes to FSs the 

unclaimed and unrefunded financial assistance that are still in custody 

of the MRC. 

 

1.28 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

CO The Financial and Management Service – Accounting Division 

(FMS-AD) still awaits the Delivery Receipts relative to 

deliveries of ₱15,246.21 as a basis of recording it in the books. 



92 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

IX As of March 23, 2021, the outstanding balance from MLFSI 

amounts to ₱294,927.20, which is also the amount to be recorded 

by the Accountant in the books of accounts as Other Receivables 

in March 2021. Representations with MLFSI about the 

unclaimed financial assistance were also already performed and 

in compliance with the MOA, MLFSI will prepare a check to 

return the outstanding balance. Finally, Management plans to 

institute additional measures to ensure that amounts transferred 

to MLFSI are immediately claimed by the beneficiaries through 

performing a weekly update of outstanding balances for the 

information and follow-up of the FOs in the different areas in the 

Zamboanga Peninsula. 

 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

 

1.29 Sections 3 and 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides 
the accounting treatment, recognition, measurement, derecognition of PPEs 

to ensure that all PPEs are properly valued and recorded, to wit: 

 

 Section 3. Criteria for Recognition. Xxx 
 

a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service 
potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the 

government; 

d. the asset is used to achieve government objective; and 
e. it meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00. 

 

 Sec. 40. Idle, Unserviceable and Fully Depreciated PPE.              
 

Xxx 

 

c. A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of 
providing the entity with future economic benefits or service 

potential. 

 

d. All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and 
Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 

74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books 

by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment 

(cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 



93 
 

1.30 Furthermore, Section 41, Chapter 10, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
provides accounting for lost/stolen/damaged/destroyed property as follows: 

 

Xxx 

 

b. Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and 

impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt 

of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property 

(RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice of Loss 

prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The loss 

shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal 

to its carrying amount. 

 

c. The accountability of the accountable officer over the loss of 

depreciable asset shall be based on depreciated replacement cost 

(DRC) PPSAS 21 par. 45. DRC is replacement cost less 

accumulated depreciation calculated on the basis of replacement 

cost. 

 

d. A receivable account shall be set up to record the accountability 

of the accountable officer simultaneous with derecognition of 

the lost PPE.  

 

e. Compensation from third parties for items of PPE that were 

impaired, lost or given up shall be recognized as income when 

the compensation becomes receivable.  

 

f. In case of partial destruction/loss of PPE the amount to be 

derecognized shall be its carrying value less the fair value of the 

remaining serviceable portion. 

 

1.31 While, Section 10, Chapter 8 of the same Manual provides that tangible 
items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as 

semi-expendable property. The following policies apply as follows: 

 

 Semi-expendable properties which were recognized as PPE shall 
be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 

 These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue 
to the end-user. 

 

1.32 The balance of PPE accounts as of December 31, 2020 in DOLE CO, NCR,  
and five ROs is misstated by ₱2,130,352.96 due to the following errors and 

omissions:

c) Lost and damaged PPE still recorded in the books 
 

1.36 The following PPE items were damaged by fire in DOLE RO IV-B and 
were still recorded in the books due to the failure of the RO’s Field Officer 

to prepare and submit to the Accounting Unit the Report of Lost, Stolen, 

Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) as required under Section 41, 

Chapter 10, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

d) Semi-expendable PPE items classified as PPE accounts 
 

1.37 Review of the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) of CO and NCR showed the 
following misclassification of accounts resulting in an overstatement of PPE 

accounts of ₱1,998,793.66, net of understatement, due to the inclusion of 

Semi-expendable PPE items in the PPE accounts of CO and NCR, 

amounting to ₱1,438,783.36 and ₱560,010.30, respectively, considering that 

their amounts fall below the ₱15,000.00 capitalization threshold.

Total 1,438,783.36 560,010.30 

 

1.38 For NCR, the semi-expendable items with a total amount of ₱560,010.30 
still classified as PPE and were not reclassified to the appropriate inventory 

accounts nor recognized as expenses upon issuance to the end-users contrary 

to the above provisions. Thus, overstated the PPE accounts by the carrying 

amount of ₱560,010.30 and understated the related expense accounts by the 

same amount. All of these items were fully depreciated, and for years were 

not adjusted in the books of accounts 

 

1.39 We recommended and the Management agreed to instruct the 
Accountant and the Property Officer of the concerned Offices to 

reconcile and effect the necessary corrections in the books and 

RPCPPE for the unrecorded, unserviceable, disposed, transferred, lost 

and damage, and misclassified PPE items, as well as the misstatements 

in the affected accounts duly supported with proper documentation. 

 

1.40 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

CO Management agreed to comply with the recommendations. 

Ongoing review, verification and analysis are being done by the 

Accounting Division. 

I Management committed to comply with the audit 

recommendation. 

IV-B The Property Officer will issue the Property Transfer Receipt to 

the CAR where ARD Rodriguez was assigned. Moreover, the 

Regional Director will prepare a letter for a request of relief of 

accountability to COA. 



97 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

VII Management commented that they will have the recommendation 

fully implemented by May 2021, including the actual disposal. 

IX Management has already started the process of disposing some 

unserviceable equipment last January 2021 and will complete the 

disposal by the end of December 2021. Further, the Accountant 

also agreed to book up the disposal as soon as the disposal 

process is completed as well as to stop the practice of 

reclassifying unserviceable and fully depreciated properties in 

the Other Assets account effective in CY 2021. 

 

 

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 

 

1.41 The total balance of the Financial Liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was 
misstated by ₱27,437,334.49 due to the following errors and omissions:

accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be 

reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the 

Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, 

all documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two 

years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed, 

shall be subject to automatic reversion.” 

 

1.43 Review of the Accounts Payable account of NCR and RO XI disclosed that 
the amount of ₱26,883,800.43 is outstanding for more than two years and is 

due for reversion. Details are as follows:

1.44 Section 2, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAS, Volume I defines Accounts 
Payable as: “Accounts Payable – refers to valid and legal obligations of 

NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been 

delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when 

these obligations were incurred.” 

 

1.45 Out of ₱1,291,723.00 recorded Accounts Payable in RO XI, only 
₱412,100.00 worth of POs were delivered and considered as valid 

obligation, thus an overstatement of ₱879,623.00 recorded liabilities as of 

December 31, 2020, details as follows:

1.46 The Audit Team disagrees with the Accountant’s view of recognizing the 
liability even without the delivery of the goods or service contracted and 

obligating the same though not yet due and demandable, so that the 

corresponding funds may not be reverted to the BTr. 

 

c) Unadjusted misstatements from previous audit report 
 

1.47 Validation of prior years’ audit recommendations showed that out of 
₱343,744.17 unrecognized Liabilities account in the books of the CO; only 

₱17,655.23 was adjusted thereby leaving a balance of ₱326,088.94. This 

pertains to the payments made to various officers and employees which 

reduced the Due to Officers and Employees and the related expense account 

balances by the same amount. This prior year’s observation was presented in 

Part III of this Report. 

 

1.48 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
concerned Accountants of: 

 

a. NCR and RO XI to revert the Accounts Payable totaling 
₱26,883,800.43 that have been outstanding for more than two years 

to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund in 

compliance with relevant provisions of laws; and 

 

b. CO and RO XI to prepare the adjusting entries to present the 
correct balance of the Accounts Payable as at yearend. 

 

 

 



100 
 

1.49 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

CO The Management will conduct a thorough analysis and 

necessary adjustments will be done. 

NCR The Management, through the Internal Management Service 

Division (IMSD) commented that they have instructed the 

Accountant to prepare the adjusting entry to revert the Accounts 

Payable that have been outstanding for more than two years to 

the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). They also commented that 

said reversion does not extinguish the Office from the liabilities 

since the law extends up to five years for the credit to be claimed 

as a general rule and to monitor the liabilities to the programs’ 

beneficiaries for future claims. 

XI On unreverted Accounts Payable outstanding for more than 

two years 

 

Management commented that as early as January 2021, the 

Accounting Unit together with the Supply Unit already had a 

plan of evaluating again the list of accounts payable. They added 

that the Supply Unit has already conducted immediate review 

and evaluation of accounts that are under their watch, while the 

Accounting Unit will prepare journal entries in response to the 

adjustments that will be made. Monitoring of POs shall also be 

strictly observed to ensure timely payments and enforce 

suppliers’ obligations to the agency. 

 

The Management also commits to relay to DOLE CO the 

inclusion of performance indicators relevant to the management 

of payables. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team appreciates the Management’s willingness to 

comply with the recommendations. The progress of their 

implementation will be regularly monitored until they are fully 

implemented. 

 On recording of Accounts Payable based on POs 
 

The Management has submitted an analysis of the prior period 

adjustments made, with consideration of the requirements of EO 

No. 87. 

 

Additionally, the Management has committed to submit the 

JEVs for each transaction starting CY 2021 in coordination with 

the Cashier. 



101 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Correcting entries will also be made on the overstatement of 

Accounts Payable by ₱879,623.00 after they have conducted 

their own validation and will look into the details of the 

discrepancies noted. The same shall also be done once other 

recorded payables will be evaluated. 

 

Consequently, reconciliation of the resulting differences between 

the amounts recorded per budget registries and accounting will 

be prepared once discrepancies in the Accounts Payable account 

are fully accounted for. 

 

Furthermore, the Management committed to monitor the status 

of POs, and conduct regular review of them with consideration 

of the requirements of EO 87, along with the commitment to 

ensure that details of the POs will be completely filled out. 

 

The Management has also issued instructions on its IT personnel 

to fast track the installation of e-NGAS for an additional unit in 

the Auditor’s office. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team appreciates the Management’s proactiveness in 

the implementation of our aforementioned recommendations. 

Progress of the implementation of the recommendations shall be 

regularly monitored by the Team until their full implementation. 

 

 

INTER-AGENCY PAYABLES 

 

1.50 The amount pertains to the misstatements in Due to BIR account totaling 
₱25,548.85 which remained unadjusted from last year’s audit report as 

reflected in Part III of this Report.  

 

 

OTHER PAYABLES  

 

1.51 In the CO, the following trust account balances were erroneously recorded 
as Other Payables instead of Trust Liabilities account resulting in 

overstatement and understatement of the accounts, respectively, by the same 

amount of ₱13,339,973.08.  This is not in accordance with the description of 

accounts prescribed in the GAM for NGAs, Volume III.

Accountant to make the necessary reconciliation and adjustments in the 

books to eliminate the erroneous classification of Other Payables 

totaling ₱13,339,973.08. 
 

 

Other Accounting Deficiencies 
 

2. Other accounting deficiencies totaling ₱754,358,304.82 were observed in the 
recording and reporting of financial transactions due to insufficient 

reconciliation of Accounting/Property records, non-preparation of the 

required records/reports, unsupported/ long outstanding balances,  inadequate 

monitoring of project/activities completion, and inadequate disclosure in the 

Notes to FSs; thus, affecting the reliability, accuracy, completeness and 

existence of the reported account balances of the Assets and Liabilities and 

other related accounts in the FSs of the Department as of December 31, 2020. 
 

2.1 Section 6 (e), Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I on Qualitative 
Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present 

information including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable 

information which is free from material error and bias and can be depended 

on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or 

could reasonably be expected to represent.

Details of Accounting Deficiencies: 

 

A. Deficiencies affecting CIB Accounts 
 

2.3 The reliability of the CIB accounts is affected by the deficiencies in the 
books of the Bureau of Workers with Special Concerns – Social 

Amelioration Program/ Social Amelioration and Welfare Program (BWSC-

SAP/ SAWP) as follows: 

 

a) Non-maintenance of SLs for each bank account 
 

2.4 The BWSC-CO maintained one current bank account and two local savings 
bank accounts, while the three ROs have their own separate current bank 

account, details as follows:

6) 012-1156-79  

Total 304,605,974.80 

 

2.5 However, for these six bank accounts, the Accountant of the BWSC-CO 
maintained only two SLs for CIB accounts of the CO- one for LCCA and 

another for LCSA, thus indicating deficient monitoring of the bank 

accounts. 

 

2.6 As noted, the BWSC-CO and the concerned ROs complied with the monthly 
preparation of the BRS for its bank accounts, which were submitted to the 

respective Audit Teams.  

 

2.7 However, the BWSC-CO Audit Team was not provided with copies of the 
ROs’ BRSs, thus the balances for each bank account maintained by the ROs 

as reflected in the FSs of the BWSC-CO could not be readily determined as 

to its accuracy, existence, and reliability. 

 

2.8 Had the Accountant of the BWSC-CO maintained separate SL for each bank 
account including those maintained by the ROs, validation of the correctness 

of each bank balance could have been facilitated and considering that the 

BRS for the regions were prepared by the Regional Accountants. 

 

b) Lack of supporting documents- ₱94,420,342.83  
 

2.9 Salient provisions of the Department Order (DO) No. 114-11 amending the 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 6982 state the 

following: 

 Section 2. Collection and Remittance of the Lien 
 

2.7 Report of Sugar Production, Withdrawal, Lien Collection and 

Remittance 

 



106 
 

a) For purposes of monitoring, the Mill shall submit to the DOLE 
RO a monthly Report of Sugar Production, Withdrawal, Lien 

Collection and Remittance within 10 working days from end of 

the reference month. 

 

b) The DOLE RO shall submit to the Secretary through the Bureau 
an analysis of said report within 15 days from end of the 

reference month. 

 

 Section 3. Release of Cash Bonus Fund (CBF) 
 

3.2 Proof of CBF Releases 

 

a) The release of CBF shall be evidenced by a duly signed planters' 
payroll or certified photocopy of the check issued in the name of 

the planter member. 

 

b) The Mill, Planters' Association or Cooperative shall submit to the

2.10 CIB-LCSA account comprises of two bank accounts which are the 
depository bank accounts of 20 percent SAP-Socio Economic Program 

Related Fund (SEPRF) lien on the gross production of sugar remitted by 

sugar mills/planters associations and the SAWP lien from the biodiesel and 

bioethanol companies.  

 

2.11 Analysis of the CIB-LCSA with beginning balance of ₱304,003,572.05 
disclosed that for CY 2020, a total of ₱429,280,280.40 was debited to the 

said account, while ₱145,726,292.20 was incurred for disbursements 

therefrom. Details as follows:

2.12 For CY 2020, out of ₱125,276,708.35 debited to CIB-LCSA, 
₱88,422,651.64 pertains to remittances of 20 percent Lien or SEPRF thru 

online and check deposits to LBP with only Monitoring Reports covering 

from January to December 2020 were attached thereto as required under 

Section 2.7-Report of Sugar Production, Withdrawal, Lien Collection and 

Remittance of DO No. 114-11, thus, rendered doubtful as to the 

completeness of the recorded remittances, hence affecting the fair 

presentation of the CIB-LCSA, Trust Liabilities, and Donations in Cash. 

 

2.13 Likewise, the penalty for late remittance amounting to ₱657,490.98 for 
August, September, November, and December 2020, that were collected 

from Central Azucarera De Tarlac, were only supported by Check Deposit 

Slips which was acknowledged by the Cash Collecting Officer of the Bureau 

thru the issuance of Official Receipts (ORs) with no data as to the 

correctness of the computation of 10 percent per month on the unremitted 

lien collection.  

 

2.14 Also, the forfeited unclaimed and undistributed cash bonus from ROs 
totaling ₱5,340,200.21 collected from ROs II, VI, VIII, and XI were only 

supported with ORs acknowledging the collections and without documents 

showing how the amounts were computed nor data supporting the collection 

for such cash bonus which rendered it difficult to monitor what amount 

should have been collected or accrued in favor of the sugar workers. 

 

2.15 We recommended and the Management agreed to instruct the 
Accountant of BWSC SAP/SAWP to: 

 

a. maintain separate SL for each bank account and present the same 
to the Audit Team for validation;  

 

b. furnish the BWSC-CO Audit Team copies of the BRSs submitted 
by the ROs III, VI and X; 

 



108 
 

c. require the concerned ROs to submit documents supporting the 
remittances, penalty on unremitted lien collection and forfeited 

unclaimed and undistributed cash bonus in compliance with the 

DO No. 114-11; and 

 

d. submit the analysis of monthly Report of Sugar Production, 
Withdrawal, Lien Collection and Remittance. 

 

B. Deficiencies affecting Inter-Agency Receivables 
 

2.16 The reliability of the Inter-Agency Receivables accounts is affected by the 
deficiencies in the books of the CO and RO VI, details as follows: 

 

a) Unreconciled balance of Due from NGAs - ₱5,042,021.16 
 

2.17 Analysis and reconciliation made by the Audit Team in the books of the CO, 
showed a variance of ₱5,042,021.16 that needs further verification by the 

Management vis-à-vis per records of the PS-DBM due to inadequate 

measures adopted to account its assets thus affecting the reliability of the 

Due from NGAs-PS-DBM account.

2.18 Meanwhile, it was worthy to note that for CY 2020, Management exerted 
effort in reconciling the accounts of Due from NGAs- PS-DBM with PS-

DBM records to come up with the accurate balance thereof by recording the 

necessary adjusting entries totaling ₱16,211,459.22 based from our previous 

and current audit observations. 

 

2.19 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Chief 
Accountant and Property Officer to continue reconciling their records 

with the PS-DBM to eliminate the variance of ₱5,042,021.16. 

 

b) Negative SL balances of account Due from LGUs - ₱591,450.50 
 

2.20 In RO VI, the year-end balance amounting to ₱884,539,260.10 included 
negative SL balances of ₱591,450.50. Review of the account showed that 

the negative balance increased by ₱2,662.00 in CY 2019 due to an error in 

the recording of liquidation/s which is still for analysis and reconciliation of 

the Accountant. Details of the LGUs with negative balances are as follows:

2.21 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
Accountant of RO VI to analyze and prepare necessary entries to adjust 

the negative amounts included in each account. 

 

C. Deficiencies affecting Intra-Agency Receivables 
 

2.22 The reliability of the Intra -Agency Receivables accounts is affected by the 
deficiencies in the books of the BWSC SAP/SAWP and RO VI, details as 

follows: 

 

a) Unreconciled Due from ROs - ₱17,447,699.40 
 

2.23 Results of confirmation letters made with the ROs Audit Teams on the 
balance of the account Due from ROs of the BWSC SAP/SAWP disclosed a 

disparity of ₱17,447,699.40 due to the failure of the Management to conduct 

regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the existence of 

the fund transfers with the ROs. For ROs III, VI, VII, and VIII, no 

confirmations were received to date.

2.24 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
Accountant of BWSC SAP/SAWP to conduct regular analysis of the 

account Due from ROs and coordinate with the DOLE ROs 

Accountants for the reconciliation of the records, effect all necessary 

adjustments, and establish balance per fund and RO. 

 

b) Unreconciled Due from Operating Units - ₱54,141.92 
 

2.25 In RO VI, the account Due from Operating Units reported an unreconciled 
balance of ₱54,141.92 as of December 31, 2020. It was noted that these 

balances were still being carried over in the books of accounts for 

transactions that have transpired way back CY 2012-2013. 

 

2.26 The balance of this Intra-Agency account represents funds transferred by the 
RO VI to the Provincial/Field Offices (P/FOs), wherein accounts opened by 

the P/FOs in prior years were already closed and pertinent documents 

already submitted to the RO. These unutilized balances were claimed to 

have been remitted to the BTr., but balances  still showed in RO books due 

to lack of reconciliation, details as follows:

2.27 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
Accountant of RO VI to conduct reconciliation and accordingly effect 

the necessary adjustments. 

 

2.28 Management commented that during the exit conference, the Accountant 
informed that the reconciliation of the account balances will resume in July 

2021. 

 

D. Deficiencies affecting Other Receivables 
 

2.29 The reliability of the Other Receivables accounts is affected by the 
deficiencies in the books of DOLE CO, BWSC SAP/SAWP, and RO VI due 

to insufficient monitoring and reconciliation, details as follows: 

 

a) Unreconciled Due from NGOs/CSOs balances - ₱2,862,686.30

in the books, however, per Report of 

Unliquidated Fund Transfers to IAs the 

amount was ₱66,830,686.81, resulting in 

unreconciled difference.  

Total  2,862,686.30  

 

2.30 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
concerned Accountants to expedite the analysis of the unreconciled 

balances to reflect the accurate balance of the account. 

 

b) SL accounts with abnormal or negative balances – ₱54,960.00 
 

2.31 Various SL accounts have negative/abnormal balances, contrary to the 
Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 3 which describes that the account 

Other Receivables has a normal debit balance.  

 



112 
 

2.32 In RO VI, negative balances of Due from NGOs/CSOs were noted in the 
amount of (₱54,000.00) for the account of Stitching BRAC International 

Philippine Branch and (₱960.00) for the account of Noemi S. Dela Peña. 

 

2.33 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
Accountant of RO VI to analyze and effect adjustments on accounts 

with negative balances. 

 

E. Deficiencies affecting PPE 
 

2.34 Hereunder are the pertinent provisions of Chapter 10 - PPE of the GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I: 

 

 Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic 
physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and 

presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant 

and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of 

each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not 

later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at 

station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be 

reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording. 

 

 Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for 
PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each 

category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock, 

etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, 

description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 

impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit 

shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account 

for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC 

shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other Property 

records like PAR. 

 

 Property Card (Appendix 70) - this card shall be used by the 
Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the 

description, acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other 

information about the PPE. It shall be kept for each class of 

PPE. 

 

 Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (Appendix 71) 
- this card shall be used for each class of PPE to record the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, 

depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, 



113 
 

repair history and other information about the property. It 

shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting Office/Unit. 

 

 Property Acknowledgement Receipt (Appendix 72) - This 
form shall be used by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit to report the issuance of PPE and the 

acknowledgement of the end-user. 

 

 The Report on the Physical Count PPE (Appendix 73) - the 
form used to report on the physical count of PPE by type 

such as land, land improvements, infrastructure, building 

and other structures, machinery and equipment, 

transportation equipment, furniture, fixtures and books, etc. 

which are owned by the agency. It shall be prepared yearly 

by fund cluster. 

 

 Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property 
(Appendix 74) - this report shall be used to account for all 

unserviceable property of an entity which is subject to 

disposal. It also serves as the basis in derecognizing the 

unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts. 

 

2.35 Moreover, Section 79 of PD 1445-Destruction or sale of unserviceable 
property states that When government property has become unserviceable 

for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 

officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his 

duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, 

if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. 

If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder 

under the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in 

the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 

representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the 

Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any 

newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does 

not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in 

at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. 

In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a 

private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body 

concerned and approved by the Commission.

Among the deficiencies noted in the RPCPPE of the ROs that contribute to 

differences between the accounting and property records are as follows: 
 

1. Unrecognized Building improvements; 
2. Unaccounted PPE/balances; 
3. Valuation differences; 
4. Misclassified PPE; 
5. Lack of an itemized list/breakdown of the composition of PPE accounts;

1. Listings of PPE were done in alphabetical order; 
2. No total amount per class of PPE; 
3. The column for unit value of PPE was not completely filled up; 
4. The shortage/overage column was left blank; and

Despite the derecognition of these properties from the agency’s book, the 

Management failed to observe timely disposal of the assets, considering that these 

were acquired 10 to 15 years ago. Consequently, the agency’s lack of action to 

dispose of such properties resulted in the accumulation of a significant number of 

unserviceable properties kept in the stockyard.

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

NCR The Management, through the IMSD Chief, instructed the 

Accountant and the Property Officer to assign personnel to 

update and adjust the above-said discrepancies and update the 

PPELC and PC. 

I Management promised to comply with the said 

recommendations. They will form an Inventory Committee to 

conduct the inventory and reconciliation of the PPE account 

balances. 

III Management will strengthen and improve recording of 

procurement of supplies, equipment and repairs of service 

vehicles through use of ledger cards.  The IMSD shall reconcile 

deficiencies noted on existing records of the RO and P/FO and 

shall provide the Office of the resident Auditor the required 

adjusted reports with corresponding adjustments to be taken in 

the accounting books.  These items are included in the areas that 

will be under the direct supervision of the Office of the Assistant 

Regional Director including the regular and timely submission 

of the required reports. 

IV-B The Management issued a Memorandum to the Supply and 

Property Officer to conduct disposal of all unserviceable 

properties not later than June 2021. 

V Management replied that they have been conducting an annual 

actual physical count of property, plant and equipment and semi-

expendable equipment for the previous years, consisting of the 

Property Officer, Accountant, together with the Auditor or 

his/her representative.  
 

Since 2018, they have entrusted the conduct of inventory to the

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Supply Officer in the provinces.  For CY 2020, they were not 

able to conduct actual inventory taking due to the risks of 

COVID-19 pandemic and the protocol requirements to be 

observed, they postponed the conduct of actual physical count of 

PPEs.  Instead, they requested the designated Supply Officers of 

the P/FO to conduct actual physical count of PPE as of 

December 31, 2020 and be submitted to the Auditor’s Office on 

or before March 31, 2021. For CY 2021, they intend to conduct 

the actual physical count of PPE not later than the 3rd Quarter of 

2021. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

As stated in the AOM, the Agency has submitted a RPCPPE, 

which is appreciated by the Audit Team because the report 

collaborates or tallies with what is reported in the FS as of 

December 31, 2020. 
 

However, the Audit Team sustains their recommendation that an 

Inventory Committee must be created, as required by the 

regulations, to conduct the actual physical count of PPEs and the 

Semi-Expendable Equipment. The Audit Team will monitor the 

commitment of the Management that an actual physical count of 

PPE and Semi-Expendable Equipment will be conducted this 

CY 2021. 

VI During the exit conference, the Accountant informed that the 

updated PCs will be submitted in April 2021, PPELC for Office 

Equipment was submitted on March 28, 2021 while PPELC for 

ICT Equipment will be submitted in the 2nd Quarter of CY 

2021. The necessary adjustments for Office Equipment will be 

recorded in the 1st Quarter of CY 2021 and the reconciliation of 

the ICT will start this April 2021. 

VII The Management affirmed with the recommendations and 

committed to comply on May 31, 2021. 

 

F. Deficiencies affecting Financial Liabilities 
 

2.39 The reliability of the Financial Liabilities accounts is affected by the lack of 
supporting ledgers and/or subsidiary records. 

 

2.40 Section 12, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, enumerates the required 
books of accounts to be maintained by the NGAs, one of which is the SL. 

Appendix 6, of the GAM, Volume II, states that the SL shows the detail for 

each control account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund 

cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. The term “per account” denotes 



118 
 

per debtor/creditor or per item, as the case may be. The totals of the SL 

balances should reconcile with the corresponding GL controlling account. 

 

2.41 In RO VI, Accounts Payable amounting to ₱77,082,190.99 as of December 
31, 2020 was not supported with Ledgers/subsidiary records. 

 

2.42 While in RO VII, SLs of Accounts Payable, and Due to Officers and 
Employees with account balances of ₱12,690,931.29 and ₱453,808.75, 

respectively, were not prepared by the Accountant for all GL accounts. The 

accounting entries were directly posted to the GLs, supporting SLs were not 

kept to track the agency’s financial transactions. Due to the non-

maintenance of these SLs, possible errors in postings in the GL may be 

difficult to trace and important financial information may not be readily 

available for analysis, if needed, by both the Management and the Audit 

Team.  

 

2.43 We recommended and the Management agreed to direct the 
Accountants of ROs VI and VII to prepare and maintain individual SL 

for each GL control account in compliance with Section 12, Chapter 2 

of the GAM for NGAs and to regularly update the SL record. 

 

2.44 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comment  

VI The Audit Team informed that the required SL for the Accounts 

Payable was submitted by the Accountant on March 21, 2021.  

VII The Management admitted its lapses in the preparation of SLs, 

stating this was not previously prepared by prior Accountants. 

Nonetheless, the Management committed to comply with the 

audit recommendations and that a copy of SLs will be submitted 

on May 20, 2021. 

 

G. Deficiencies affecting Inter-Agency Payables 
 

2.45 The reliability of the Inter-Agency Payables accounts is affected by the following 
deficiencies: 

 

a) Unreconciled balances of contributions/ loans repayments and 
remittances/ refunds for accounts Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-ibig and 

Due to Philhealth 

 

2.46 In the CO, discrepancies were noted between the SL and monitoring report 
of AO in-charge of deductions and remittances. This audit observation was 

discussed in the previous year’s audit report, but is still for reconciliation by 

the Management.

2.48 Had the Management properly review and verify the entries made, the 
negative balances noted could have been prevented in compliance with 

Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 

2.49 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Accountant 
and other concerned personnel of DOLE CO and RO VI to reconcile 

their records and make the necessary adjustments to eliminate the:  

 

a. unsettled prior year’s difference in the amounts of deductions and 
remittances; and 

 

b. accounts with negative balances. 
 

 

 



121 
 

H. Deficiencies affecting Trust Liabilities 
 

2.50 The reliability of the Trust Liabilities accounts is affected by the following 
deficiencies: 

  

a) Unreconciled and long outstanding balance of the account Trust 
Liabilities - ₱1,455,571.91 

 

2.51 Verification of the account of RO IX disclosed a balance of ₱6.965 million 
as of December 31, 2020, while a review and analysis of the SL balances for 

the account showed a total of ₱7.038 million, resulting in a net difference of 

₱73,571.91. 

 

2.52 Moreover, a lump sum amount of ₱1.382 million was described only in the 
SL as “Over three years” which cast doubt as to the accuracy and 

completeness of the reported balance of the Trust Liabilities account. 

  

2.53 These accounts being over three years beyond the prescriptive period for 
unpaid claims which may be held as a special fund of the agency following 

relevant provisions of Article 129 of the Labor Code. 

 

b) Lack of supporting SLs/records for Trust Liabilities and 
Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable accounts - ₱152,298,845.52 

 

2.54 In ROs VI and VII, balances of the Trust Liabilities and Guaranty/Security 
Deposits Payable accounts totaling ₱150,453,756.97 and ₱1,845,088.55, 

respectively as of December 31, 2020 were not supported with SLs/records. 

 

2.55 Due to the absence of SLs/records to provide details and support the GL 
balances, the reliability and validity of the accounts cannot be immediately 

ascertained.  

 

2.56 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
Accountant of: 

 

a. RO IX to analyze and reconcile SLs and to eliminate unreconciled 
and long outstanding balances; and 

 

b. ROs VI and VII to prepare and maintain individual SL for each 
GL control account in compliance with Section 12, Chapter 2 of the 

GAM and to regularly update the SL record. 

 

 

 

 

 



122 
 

2.57 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comment 

VI During the exit conference, the Accountant informed that the 

updated SLs for Trust Liabilities will be reconciled with the 

corresponding GL controlling accounts and the duly adjusted 

SL as of December 31, 2020 will also be submitted this 3rd 

Quarter of CY 2021. 

 

The Accountant likewise informed the submission of SLs for 

Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account. The remaining 

SLs for Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable will be submitted 

this 2nd Quarter of CY 2021. 

VII The Management admitted its lapses in the preparation of SLs, 

stating this was not previously prepared by previous 

Accountants. Nonetheless, the Management committed to 

comply with the audit recommendations and that copies of SLs 

will be submitted on May 20, 2021. 

IX Management through the Accountant assured that a 

reconciliation of the SL and GL will be done, however, for the 

lump sum balance of ₱1.382 million, supporting documents 

are already in storage and will take significant effort to locate 

to provide a detailed breakdown of the amount.   

 

I. Deficiencies affecting Other Payables 
 

2.58 The reliability of the Other Payables account is affected by the following 
deficiencies:

b) Unreconciled balances - ₱986,073.53 
 

2.60 The total amount of ₱986,073.53 labeled as “For Reconciliation” in the SLs 
of the account remained uncorrected to date by the CO, thus affecting the 

reliability of the Other Payables account. Since this deficiency was already 

noted in the previous years’ audit report, the Management should likewise 

expedite the analysis to come up with a more reliable balance of the account 

Other Payables. Summary is as follows:

2.61 The balance of the Other Payables account totaling ₱9,774,208.82 and 
₱15,350,977.50 in ROs VI and VII; respectively as of December 31, 2020 

were not supported with SLs/records. 

 

2.62 Due to the absence of SLs/records to provide details and support the GL 
balances, the reliability and validity of the accounts cannot be immediately 

ascertained.  

 

2.63 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
Accountant of: 

 

a. CO and NCR to account the specific causes of the negative 
balances, reclassify those trust receipts/liabilities with 

corresponding cash accounts to their proper accounts, and prepare 

appropriate adjusting journal entries; and  
 

b. ROs VI and VII to prepare/maintain and update the individual SL 
for each GL control account in compliance with Section 12, 

Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

2.64 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comment 

CO The Management committed to request the proper disposition of 

the said account due to unavailability of records. The Accountant 

informed that the balances were tagged as “for reconciliation” 

just to implement the e-NGAS as advised by the COA Team in-

charge for the roll-out of e-NGAS. 

NCR The Management, through the IMSD Chief commented that they 

have instructed the Accountant to review/reconcile the accounts 

with negative balances amounting to ₱1,624,341.62 and prepare 

necessary adjusting journal entries and to reclassify trust 

receipts/liabilities i.e., cases and judgement awards, with 

corresponding cash accounts. 

VI During the exit conference the Accountant informed that the 

remaining SLs for Other Payables will be submitted this 2nd 

Quarter of CY 2021. 

VII The Management admitted its lapses in the preparation of SLs, 

stating this was not previously prepared by prior Accountants. 

Nonetheless, the Management committed to comply with the 

audit recommendations and that copies of SLs will be submitted 

on May 20, 2021.

one to five years ₱84,821,146.73, and 10 to more than 30 years 

₱11,140,429.41.  

 

However, our further analysis of SL balances of the account 

disclosed that the funds transferred to ROs from April to June 

2020 totaling ₱63,461,560.00 were outstanding for more than six 

to eight months not consistent with the reported aging of Due 

from ROs as presented in the Notes to FSs.   

 

It was also noted that the aging schedule of receivables does not 

conform with the forms being required in the GAM for NGAS, 

Volume II, resulted in erroneous aging of fund transfer and the 

proper analysis thereof could not be conducted. 
IV-A Various information/explanation and disclosure requirements 

were not provided such as:

VI Review of the Notes to FS for CY 2020 disclosed that the breakdown 

and/or composition of the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable and 

Other Payables accounts were also not provided. 

IX The Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity showed Prior Period 

Adjustments/Unrecorded Income and Expenses totaling ₱89.639 

million for CY 2020, however, based on the disclosures presented in 

Note 4 of the Notes to FSs only a description of the adjustments was 

disclosed without any breakdown of the period to which the 

adjustments pertain.  

 

2.67 We recommended and the Management agreed to instruct the 
Accountants of: 

 

a. BWSC SAP/SAWP to submit the correct aging of receivables and 
revise the Notes to FSs; and 

 

b. ROs IV-A, V, VI and IX to provide all the information and disclosure

3. Insufficient internal control measures in the grant of financial assistance thru  
COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP); TUPAD #BKBK; and 

Abot-Kamay ang Pagtulong (AKAP) sa OFWs (AKAP for OFWs) resulted in: 

a) excessive/multiple payments totaling ₱1,023,750.00; b) denied claims and/or 

less than the amount stated in the DOLE DOs; c) unclaimed amounts in the 

possession of Money Remittance Centers (MRCs) totaling ₱22,432,840.00; and 

d) incomplete and deficient documents on the payment of financial assistance 

contrary to the pertinent DOLE DOs/AOs relative to the implementation of 

Bayanihan I or RA No. 11469, thereby casting doubt on the propriety and/or

3.14 The processes undertaken from the receipt of applications to the preparation 
of payments of financial assistance disclosed that there was no Master List 

or Database of all the approved beneficiaries on the three DOLE programs 

from which the applications may be checked whether the beneficiaries have 

already availed of any benefits/ financial assistance from the DOLE. 

 

3.15 The above excessive payments to the beneficiaries were mainly due to the 
lack of control measures in the processing of claims, thus to the detriment of 

other qualified applicants who have not availed of any financial assistance 

that could immediately help them alleviate their economic struggles brought 

about by the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

 

3.16 The noted deficiencies could have been avoided had there been an available 
Master List or database of beneficiaries with data of prior availments that 

can be accessed by the offices concerned and/or other control measures that 

could prevent such occurrence. 

 

3.17 We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the concerned Offices to conduct further investigation on 
the noted excessive payments and institute necessary actions; and 

 

b. design additional control measures to avoid double payments of 
financial assistance in the succeeding implementation of the 

Bayanihan-2 Programs. 

 



134 
 

b) Receipt of financial assistance by the beneficiaries of the AKAP, CAMP 
and TUPAD #BKBK programs were denied and/or less than the 

amount stated in the DOLE DOs; 

 

3.18 Out of the 18,107  beneficiaries of CAMP, AKAP and TUPAD #BKBK in 
10 POLOs, NCR, ROs II, IV-A, IV-B, VIII and IX who were covered by 

confirmation thru emails, phone calls and text messages, only 4,767 or 

26.33% responded, of which 221 or 4.64% denied receiving the financial 

assistance totaling ₱1,824,240.00.

3.20 Also, five beneficiaries claimed to have received less than the reported 
amount of financial assistance. 

 

3.21 The financial assistance for AKAP, CAMP and TUPAD were received by 
the beneficiaries either in person, thru banks transfers, or MRCs.  The latter 

facility directly informs the beneficiaries of the amount to be received with 

corresponding tracking/reference numbers, and other information necessary 

to expeditiously claim their respective financial benefits. The beneficiaries' 

pieces of information were based on their applications submitted to the 

DOLE offices, yet the beneficiaries still failed to receive the much-needed 

financial assistance. 

 

3.22 Also, one beneficiary from Aragon Security Agency in NCR claimed that 
the ₱5,000.00 CAMP financial assistance he received was later on deducted 

from his salary for reason that he still has work according to the said 

Agency. 

 

3.23 The non-receipt by the affected workers of the one-time financial assistance 
defeated the main purpose of the Bayanihan I Act, thru the DOLE programs, 

for the immediate assistance that could help the affected workers on their 

financial struggles brought by the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

 

3.24 We recommended and the Management agreed to require: 
 

a. POLOs, NCR and RO IV-A to conduct further investigation on the 

beneficiaries who denied receipt and received less than the 

approved amount of the financial assistance;  

 

b. NCR to: 
 

 validate if the concerned Security Agency 
 

 claimed the CAMP assistance for their employees; 
 made payroll deductions to the concerned employee for the 

financial assistance received from DOLE; and 

 require the concerned Security Agency to refund for any 
misrepresentation with DOLE; 



137 
 

 

 verify if the beneficiaries who did not receive the financial 
assistance were considered in the list of unclaimed amounts to be 

submitted by the concerned MRCs; 

 

c. RO IV-B to instruct the remittance center to submit proof of 
release of financial assistance; and 

 

d. Internal Audit Service to evaluate the adequacy of existing internal 

controls on the payments of financial assistance by the POLOs to 

OFWs/beneficiaries and institute additional procedures that would 

minimize the deficiencies noted.  

 

c) Unclaimed Financial Assistance in the possession of MRCs -
₱22,432,840.00; 

 

3.25 To facilitate speedy releases of the wages, benefits and financial assistance 
to the intended recipients/beneficiaries, the ROs engaged the services of 

MRCs thru MOA. However, unlike in the NCR, most of the ROs did not 

include the provision whereby the MRCs have the obligation to remit the 

amount that remained unclaimed for a certain period, while CAR, ROs V 

and XIII do not have existing MOA with their respective MRCs, which is 

also a violation of Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-

001. 

 

3.26 Review of the funds transferred to the MRCs disclosed that a total of 
₱22,432,840.00 financial assistance with ₱83,190.00 service fees remained 

unclaimed as of December 31, 2020 by the recipients/beneficiaries. Details

3.28 We recommended and the Management agreed to require all ROs 
concerned to: 

 

a. continue informing the beneficiaries to claim the financial 
assistance from the respective MRCs; and 

 

b. closely monitor the status of the unclaimed CY 2020 amounts 
and/or require the MRCs for the immediate refund of the 

amounts intended for those unknown beneficiaries. 

 

d) Incomplete documentation on the payment of financial assistance; and

3.31 For the suggestion posed by LabAtt Delmer R. Cruz of POLO Germany on 
the use of their online application system instead of submitting copies of the 

required documents, we have communicated to Management on March 4, 

2021, the letter-reply of the National Government Sector (NGS) – Cluster 5 

Director relative to the submission of documents directly to COA via 

https://mika-el.coa.gov.ph, and still, we remain with our observation until 

the concerned office complied with the requirements stated in the said letter.  

 

3.32 The respective DOLE issuances set the specific guidelines and 
documentations to ensure that the only recipients of the financial assistance 

under the DOLE AKAP for OFWs, CAMP, and TUPAD #BKBK programs 

are qualified, prioritized and intended beneficiaries of the Bayanihan to Heal 

as One Act Law. 

 

3.33 The lack of and/or insufficient documents submitted casts doubt on the 
eligibility of the beneficiaries of the said programs and might affect the 

assurance that the objectives of Bayanihan to Heal as One Act Law has been 

fully achieved. 

 

3.34 We recommended and the Management agreed to require: 
 

a. POLOs, ROs VI, IX and XIII to coordinate with the focal person 
and submit the lacking documents as required under the pertinent 

DOLE DOs/AOs;  

 

b. RO III to send confirmation letters to other DOLE RO on other 
benefits that may have been paid to employees who are not 

residents in Region III and submit immediately to the audit team 

for validation purposes;  and 

 

c. POLOs, NCR, ROs IV-A, IV-B, V, VI, IX, X, and XI to submit 
explanation on the deficiencies noted and ensure that supporting 

documents submitted are properly evaluated in accordance with 

the requirements of the DOLE DOs/AOs.

January 29, 2021. 

 

Receipt of Financial Assistance 

 

POLO Germany – 

Resubmitted the proof of bank transfers and bank statement for 18 

OFWs in Russia and Netherlands. 

 

The Post will again reiterate its request from the concerned bank to 

identify and inform the concerned OFWs for their AKAP financial 

assistance. 

 

In view of the challenges in making AKAP payments via bank transfer 

in Russia, they agreed in December 2020 to a physical pay-out to the 

beneficiaries. The latter can pick up their payment for AKAP financial 

assistance at the Philippine Embassy by appointment starting the first 

week of February 2021. 

 

POLO Bahrain – 

 

Submitted Confirmation Letters of 27 OFWs who initially denied 

having received financial assistance as listed in Annex D of AOM No. 

2021-002. They commented that: 

 

1. Thru phone and personal conversations made by Post to 
validate the non-receipt of claims of the subject OFWs, they 

claimed that they initially denied receipt of the assistance due 

to the following:  COA’s email was unclear, affirming the 

receipt might foil their chances of receiving another batch of 

financial assistance as they were hoping to receive again, 

email addresses of some of the OFWs are shared with other 

family members (wife, cousin, sister) who unknowingly 

replied to COA’s email for them, one did not bother to reply 

back because he cannot edit the form while some thought that 

the email was a scam while others thought that it pertains to 

assistance received in the Philippines and not at the Post. 

2. As most of the recipients encountered difficulty in 
downloading the Confirmation Letter/ form and expressed the 

tasks of printing and uploading it again as inconvenient, the 

Post allowed that: (1) photo taken of the accomplished form, 

or  (2) email/ printscreen of whatsapp conversation confirming 

the receipt of the assistance instead of accomplishing the form 

be submitted. They hope that these alternative modes of 

receipt confirmation be acceptable to COA, too. 

3. OFW Orquio has already left for the Philippines and despite 
several attempts to reach her to request that she accomplish the 

Confirmation Letter/Form and/or specify the amount she 

received in her email, all means to reach her were to no avail 

and all subsequent emails sent by POLO were ignored. They 



143 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

then appeal that her email of January 22, 2021 be accepted as 

confirmation of her receipt of the financial assistance of BD75 

from POLO-Bahrain. 

 

POLO Jeddah – 

 

Submitted copies of Acknowledgement Receipt (AR) that the OFWs 

signed upon receipt of the AKAP assistance. The workers were even 

photographed receiving said assistance. One worker authorized a 

representative, whose photograph was taken, to claim her assistance. 

The Post does not have any way to check if the money was actually 

given to the worker. 

 

One worker claimed that she was not the one who replied to the email 

considering that the form does not bear the name of the target 

respondent. The survey form was emailed to a group email of 

applicants and one worker whose application was denied, replied to the 

email. 

 

A worker who authorized the Post to send her financial assistance to 

the Philippines conveyed her apologies. She confirmed that her family 

received the assistance through money transfer. The voucher will only 

be submitted to the Post when the beneficiary confirmed receipt. 

 

POLO Riyadh – 

 

Commented that OFW Michelle Ramos F. Cuarto received the one-

time cash assistance under the DOLE-AKAP Program for OFWs on 

May 19, 2020. The email response from conniesy70@gmail.com 

stating that OFW Cuarto has not yet received the one-time cash 

assistance was made by the owner of the email herself named Ms. 

Connie Sy whose email was used by the former in the submission of 

the documentary requirements for her DOLE-AKAP application, 

attached for reference is a copy of the affidavit of OFW Cuarto 

confirming that she already received said cash assistance. 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

During the exit conference, Undersecretary (Usec) Renato L. Ebarle 

commented that Secretary Silvestre H. Bello III already directed the 

ROs to submit immediately the report on the status of the unclaimed 

amounts in the possession of MRCs and the reasons thereof.  

 

Usec Ebarle also considered the need to draft a uniform MOA with 

MRCs to be adopted by the ROs. 

 

Usec Ana C. Dione added that they already requested the ROs to 

immediately submit the updated amount of unclaimed financial 

assistance as of February 2021. 



144 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

Incomplete Documentation 

 

POLO Jordan, Bahrain and Riyadh have submitted all the lacking 

documents, while POLO Jeddah, Greece, and Riyadh partially 

submitted the lacking documents. 

 

On expired passport, POLO Jeddah commented that OFWs with 

deficient documents, whose passports have expired, are either 

undocumented or have not yet renewed their passports at the time of 

application, thus their applications were approved. Other OFWs are 

not keen or aware of the expiration of their passport. With the 

lockdown for several months, workers have difficulty of getting 

appointment with the Consular Section for renewing their passport. 

Some of these worker’s passports are with their employers for 

safekeeping. Other employers refused to give copy of the passports to 

their employees/workers, thus the workers submitted the available 

copy they have.   

 

On expired OECs of OFWs, the OFWs secure OECs in the Philippines 

before returning to their host country. A good number of these OFWs 

were stranded in the Kingdom because of the lockdown imposed by 

the Saudi government even if they were already due to return to the 

Philippines, thus their OECs were not renewed. They opted to submit 

the available document they have. On no signature in AKAP Form and 

Undertaking, applications without signature in AKAP Form and/or 

Undertaking were approved. However, applicants were interviewed 

through phone. Some workers may not be very knowledgeable in 

affixing their signature in the online forms. Others claim that they 

were holed up in their accommodation without computer or printer or 

scanner because they were not allowed to go out, thus they could not 

attach their electronic signature or could not scan a printed AKAP 

Application Form or Undertaking with signature. 

 

POLO Riyadh has also partial compliance on the noted deficiencies, 

among others were: submission of expired passports and signature of 

OFW Rian B. Baloro, in his Philippine passport, was affixed 

electronically through biometric system wherein, in some cases, the 

familiarity of the stroke may not be identical with handwritten 

signature. 

 

POLO London submitted the explanation of Ms. Alquizar on the 

different signatures. With respect to OFW Gastador, this Post had 

made several follow-ups with him for submission of his explanation on 

January 23, 25, 26, and February 8, 2021. The only response received 

from him was through his email dated January 24, 2021 informing that 

he had been hospitalized since January 22, 2021, hence not able to 

answer our calls and respond to emails. The Post requested, therefore, 

that this concern be considered closed also.

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

POLO Israel submitted the lacking documents on February 11, 2021. 

 

Lastly, POLO Malaysia received information that Mr. Francis Paulo 

M. Diaz is already in the Philippines. Post will submit photos of him 

holding his financial assistance, as well as the DV he signed. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Receipt of Financial Assistance 

 

Management’s comments and actions are noted. We refute that our 

confirmation letter was unclear as it provides the following: a) the 

details of the program, b) the amount in US Dollar, Philippine Peso, or 

its equivalent in the local currency of host country; c) our contact 

details such as telephone number, email and FB account used for 

confirmation; d) the purpose of the confirmation; e) their response of 

yes or no and the required signature over the name of the beneficiary. 

And lastly, the confirmation was in the Filipino language for easy 

comprehension and to avoid any language barrier.  

 

Also, we have revalidated the submitted proof of receipt by POLO 

Bahrain, Jeddah, Kuwait, Madrid, and Riyadh to 18 beneficiaries. As 

of February 19, 2021, five beneficiaries have responded and confirmed 

that they have received the financial assistance and are already 

deducted in the presented table in Par. 16.1 and 16.2, and they are still 

waiting for the response from the rest of the beneficiaries.  

The Audit Team will also verify the BRS to be submitted to ascertain 

whether the unclaimed amounts were returned/credited to the bank 

account of POLO Germany. 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

We noted the Management comments, however, we reiterated that 

amounts pertaining to unknown beneficiaries be remitted to the BTr.

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Incomplete Documentation 

 

For the deficient documents, in order to effectively facilitate the 

financial assistance, a clarificatory advisory on CAMP documentary 

requirements was issued on April 6, 2020 / Labor Advisory 12-A 

s.2020, so as to broaden the allowed documents to be considered for 

CAMP applications. 

 

As such, some of the identified workers in the AOM are not included 

in the companies’ payrolls but are included in the establishment 

reports as said workers are newly hired, interns or are still on probation 

when the lockdown in the region was imposed. 

 

Further, this Office verified the Lists of Beneficiaries attached in the 

AOM and found that most in the list are included in the Payroll while 

the remaining are vouched by their respective companies. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Receipt of Financial Assistance 

 

Forms to be submitted by the Remittance Center will still be validated 

by the Audit Team. 

 

Incomplete Documentation 

 

For the deficient documents, the Audit Team will also verify from 

their working papers and will make adjustments if found proper, the 

beneficiaries who are not in the Payroll list but could have either 

actually been included therein and/or vouched by their employers. 

CAR Excessive/multiple payments 

 

The Batch file submitted to Universal Storefront Services Corporation 

(USSC) which was the reference of audit showed nine employees of 

South Drive Manor were included in Batch Nos. 1 and 5 and four 

employees under D’itsoy General Merchandise in Batch 4. 

Management sent a corrected copy of file for Batch 5 to USSC on 

April 13, 2020 to cancel double recording of beneficiaries under South 

Drive Manor.  

 

Demand letters were sent to three workers to refund the excess amount 

of ₱5,000.00 each.

Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations. 

 

For CAMP and TUPAD, the request for refund was endorsed to the 

MRC on January 26 and 29, 2021. 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

The Audit Team accepted Management’s action plan to comply with 

the audit recommendations. 

II Excessive/multiple payments 

 

Management commented that it was not overpayment, but rather due 

payment to the concerned beneficiaries. Among the reasons are:  

 

DO No. 209 series of 2020 does not exclude beneficiaries of TUPAD; 

 

While DO No. 209 speaks of “one-time financial assistance”, this does 

not mean that the same beneficiaries may not be allowed to avail of 

another DOLE Programs.  It means that a beneficiary for CAMP 

cannot receive twice or oftener under Bayanihan 1; 

 

That the same is true also to beneficiaries under Social Amelioration 

and Welfare Program Adjustment Measure Initiative for Biofuel 

Workers Affected by Covid-19 and its Mitigating Measures (SAWP-

Amin); and 

 

A beneficiary of TUPAD #BKBK under Bayanihan 1 may avail again 

of the same program.  This has been allowed by D.O. No. 210, which 

should be read in relation to DO 173-17 (Revised Guidelines in the 

Implementation of DOLE Integrated Livelihood and Emergency 

Employment Program. 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

Management informed the Audit Team that DOLE Central Office 

(CO) is always monitoring the unclaimed financial assistance by the 

beneficiaries.  Likewise, DOLE RO II is also monitoring from MLFSI 

the unclaimed amounts. 

 

As to the prescriptive period, Management agreed with our 

recommendation. 

 

As of January 11, and 26, 2021, the remaining unclaimed CAMP and 



148 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

TUPAD #BKBK assistance were already claimed by the beneficiaries, 

while for AKAP assistance, a total of ₱490,000.00 remained 

unclaimed but continuous follow-up and coordination with OWWA 

are being done. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Excessive/multiple payments 

 

After consideration of the aforementioned comments of Management, 

the Audit Team still sustains its findings, among the arguments are: 

 

The Department should have ensured that there was no overlapping of 

assistance granted to beneficiaries in order to promote an equitable 

sharing of limited resources during these trying times. It is not 

justifiable to allow beneficiaries to receive more than one assistance 

from the government, if not all households, who are affected by the 

pandemic were already covered.  

 

The Audit Team emphasized that each guideline has clearly defined 

the qualified beneficiaries, according to the different sectors in the 

nation’s workforce to which they belong. The team believes that what 

the guidelines do not include is automatically excluded.  Also, it has to 

be noted that based on the audit of the utilization of funds of CAMP 

under the Bayanihan I, there were still numerous establishments and 

affected workers who were not accommodated due to lack of funds. 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

The unclaimed amount of the financial assistance to beneficiaries, if 

any, will be monitored by the Audit Team.  Also, upon submission of 

the duly notarized Supplemental MOA between DOLE and MLFSI, 

said MOA is still subject to further review and evaluation. 

III Incomplete documentation 

 

Management will convene the Technical Services Support Division for 

Labor Standards and Labor Relations (TSSD I) and focal persons, 

evaluators and processors involved including the IT group and 

accounting unit in the DOLE CAMP to reconcile and check double 

payment of financial assistance to determine possible reasons for such 

occurrence.  

 

The double payment of financial assistance may be due to the 

submission of CAMP applications of part-time personnel in the 

educational sector/academe by their multiple employers.  Likewise, 

duplication may also be due to system’s inability to detect multiple 

applications due to certain restrictions such as, use of characters/string 

in encoding application as to their names.   

IV-A Excessive/multiple payments 



149 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

OWWA RO IV-A commented that they shall communicate with 

OFWs Akmad, Al-Mubarak S., Valde, Ma. Camille L. and Samiano, 

Adrian L. and require them to return the said double payment, if 

necessary, or identify if the said application is already replaced. Based 

on the given information, the OFWs intentionally misled their 

evaluators and processors by providing incorrect passports, incorrect 

first name (Adrian - Adriam), and insufficient information on the 

middle name (Lerum). 

 

Receipt of Financial Assistance 

 

Management and OWWA RWO IV-A will verify from the Remittance 

Center and validate from their records those beneficiaries who did not 

receive the financial assistance. 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

As of January 2021, all the beneficiaries of unclaimed transactions 

were contacted thru text and email to claim their financial assistance as 

soon as possible. Majority were out of reach, therefore, Management 

coordinated with various Public Employment Service Office (PESO) 

of the concerned OFWs to assist in locating them for immediate 

release of the financial assistance. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Excessive/multiple payments 

 

The Audit Team will monitor the refund of the double payments. 

Although the Audit Team understands the expedited nature and 

voluminous transactions/ documents to be validated, and instances 

where applicants purposely deceive the evaluators for personal gains, 

this does not exempt the officers of OWWA RWO IV-A from 

continuing to perform their duties and tasks diligently.   

 

Receipt of Financial Assistance 

 

The Audit Team will continue to monitor the Management’s 

compliance. 

IV-B Receipt of Financial Assistance 

 

The Management already submitted the proof of receipt of the 16 

beneficiaries. They are still waiting for the proof of receipt for the 

other 3 beneficiaries from M. Lhuillier. 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

The Management already sent a request letter to M Lhuillier for the

cancellation and refund of unclaimed transactions uploaded as of 

December 31, 2020. 

 

Incomplete documentation 

 

Management instructed the concerned Heads and employees, thru the 

issuance of Memorandum, on the required action. They will submit an 

update and copy of the explanation of the focal persons at the soonest 

time possible. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Incomplete documentation 

 

The Audit Team reminded Management to carefully review the Master 

list, verify the discrepancies and inform the Field Officers of their 

accountability on the claims made. The Team may eventually issue 

Notice of Disallowance (ND) on the fictitious names and duplications 

appearing in the Masterlist. 

V Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

Management replied that a letter dated October 27, 2020 was sent to 

MLFSI, requesting the refund of the 2017 to 2019 unclaimed benefits. 

During the exit conference, the RD and Assistant RD (ARD) informed 

that they will be sending a Demand Letter to MLFSI. 

The ARD informed that during their meeting at the DOLE-CO, in 

view of the glitches in the services of the present Service Provider, the 

IT Department at DOLE-CO is developing a system that would 

facilitate immediate determination of claimed and unclaimed 

remittances, which would be rolled out to the ROs upon completion. 

 

The total unclaimed wages/assistance as of February 15, 2021 

amounting to ₱3,249,900.00 are as follows: 

 

CAMP 400,000.00 

AKAP 590,000.00

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

The Audit Team explained that if there are claimants from the 2017 to 

2019 unclaimed benefits, the said claimants can still be allowed to 

claim but a corresponding report should be made on the subject matter, 

duly furnished the Auditor. 

 

The Audit Team requested the Program /Provincial Heads to make a 

status report as of December 31, 2020 on the actual number of 

claimants who still received the benefits from the audited unclaimed 

balances of CAMP and AKAP benefits as of September 30, 2020. 

VI Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

During the exit conference, Management informed the Audit Team 

that upon their rechecking and validation, there were 12 beneficiaries 

who recently claimed their transactions from the Remittance Center. 

Thus, the remaining unclaimed transactions as of January 15, 2021 

were reduced to 99. Management added that, out of the 99 

transactions, DOLE RO VI was able to contact and assist 12 

beneficiaries to claim their financial assistance that have been 

approved for replacement in December 2020. Moreover, the refund for 

the remaining unclaimed transactions was already requested from the 

MRC on January 26, 2021. Lastly, Management committed that 

additional provisions will be included in succeeding agreements with 

respect to the unclaimed transactions in the custody of the partner 

Remittance Center.    

 

Incomplete documentation 

 

During the exit conference, Management committed to submit/comply 

with the submission of incomplete documentation and discussed action 

plans for subsequent transactions and/or submissions to avoid similar 

observations. 

 

On CAMP, the deficiencies such as lacking application and/or 

supporting documents for application were attached to the Cashier’s 

copy of the DVs. Said documents were already submitted to COA on 

January 18 and 19, 2021. 

VIII Excessive/multiple payments 

 

On the double payment of eight CAMP beneficiaries, five were 

already settled and the other three committed for the refund of the 

other ₱5,000.00. On AKAP, Management will further verify the name 

of the beneficiary. 

 

 

 



152 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

On CAMP, as of February 10, 2021, Management already initiated the 

refund of the remaining ₱550,000.00 by MLFSI who committed that 

the amount will be immediately refunded after it passes their Audit 

Team. 

 

On AKAP, the remaining 71 beneficiaries who are yet to claim their 

₱10,000.00 were given until the end of February to claim the amount. 

 

On TUPAD #BKBK, the two identified beneficiaries were likewise 

given until the end of February to claim their ₱3,250.00. 

IX Excessive/multiple payments 

 

Management commits to review their monitoring system to avoid 

double payments to the approved beneficiaries and to check whether 

the identified beneficiaries were already replaced, otherwise, they 

agreed to communicate and collect the duplicate pay-out from the 

concerned beneficiaries. 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

As of February 23, 2021, total beneficiaries with unclaimed financial 

assistance were reduced to 19 persons or ₱190,000.00. Management 

sent letter to MLFSI requesting for the refund of the unclaimed 

financial assistance. 

 

Incomplete documentation 

 

For AKAP, Management committed to closely coordinate with 

OWWA to discuss the observations as well as agree on appropriate 

internal controls to address the observation.  

 

Management also committed to review the documents submitted by 

the establishment and submit the same. It was, however, explained that 

the noted beneficiaries were new hires who were not yet included in 

the establishment’s payroll or were separated employees who were 

already removed from the payroll. 

 

Management already submitted the company Payroll for the five 

identified worker beneficiaries to the COA Auditor on January 26, 

2021. 

X Incomplete documentation 

 

Management agreed with the audit recommendations. Action Plans 

were made to implement the recommendations: 

 

The TUPAD #BKBK Focal Person together with the Regional 

Accountant has yet to follow up the submission of the liquidation

documents, as they are still busy with the Bayanihan 2 

implementation. 

XI Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

In a letter-reply dated January 12, 2021, Management commented that 

this matter has been relayed to the DOLE-CO leading to the 

development of the system to be utilized for CAMP 2. The online 

system reports dole.gov.ph helps address and avoid the duplication of 

payout of financial assistance to beneficiaries. This system is also 

being continuously improved. 

 

The Management commented that they already sent a formal 

communication to MLFSI dated January 13, 2021, requesting copies of 

proofs of receipt by the beneficiaries of the financial assistance. Also, 

they requested therein that they be given regular updates on the status 

of unclaimed financial assistance so that they can relay this 

information to OWWA XI and aid the latter in communicating with 

the beneficiaries. 

 

Incomplete documentation 

 

The Management replied that they are currently in the process of 

conceptualization and creation of the database, the data of which will 

come from the most recent list of registered businesses in the Davao 

Region. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

The Audit Team shall request formal documentation on the 

Management’s communication on this matter to the DOLE CO. 

 

It is, however, commendable that a system has been made operational 

to decrease, if not eliminate, the risk of multiple receipts of benefits by 

individuals from the government.  

 

The Audit Team is waiting for the “received” copy of the 

communication sent to MLFSI as documentary evidence of the 

Management’s action. 

XIII Unclaimed Financial Assistance 

 

Management commented that they will prepare the MOA and submit 

the same to the Office of the Auditor.

₱2,861,113,898.92 allotments for the three regular programs, namely: TUPAD,

6.20 percent with 139.47 percent accomplishment over the target beneficiaries 

for CY 2020, thus, achieving DOLE’s contribution to the government’s agenda 

of inclusive growth thru massive job generation and poverty reduction.

4.1 The DOLE implemented the Integrated Livelihood and Emergency

employment; and b) promotion of entrepreneurship and community 

enterprises. It has two components, one of which is the Tulong 

Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers commonly 

known as TUPAD.  

 

4.2 TUPAD is a community-based package of assistance that provides 
emergency employment for a minimum period of 10 days, but not to exceed 

a maximum of 30 days, depending on the nature of work to be performed, as 

provided in DO No. 173-17 dated February 13, 2017.  

 

4.3 Qualified beneficiaries under the TUPAD program are: 1) underemployed;   
2) laid-off or terminated workers as a result of retrenchment or permanent 

closure of an establishment; and 3) self-employed workers (including 

farmers and fishermen) but have lost their livelihoods because of natural 

calamities/disasters, economic crisis, armed conflicts and/or seasonality of 

work. Only one member of a household shall be qualified to avail of the 

program in a year. However, a beneficiary can avail again in the event that 

he/she becomes a victim of a calamity/disaster. 

 

4.4 Section 7 of DO No. 173-17 on the implementation phase of TUPAD 
program, provides among others, that all workers shall be paid one hundred 

percent of the prevailing private sector minimum wage in the area/locality, 

subject to the submission of validated daily time records.

marginalized workers in the informal and formal economies to start 

individual or group livelihood undertakings. 

 

B. KABUHAYAN Enhancement - enabling existing livelihood 
undertakings to grow into viable and sustainable businesses that 

provide income at least at par with those of the minimum wage 

earners. 

 

C. KABUHAYAN Restoration - enabling the re-establishment of lost 
or damaged livelihoods due to occurrence of natural 

disasters/calamities. 

 

4.6 Section 10. Beneficiaries- The following are the eligible beneficiaries:

h) Persons with Disability (PWD); 
i) Senior Citizens; 
j) Indigenous people; 
k) Parents/Guardians of child laborers; 
l) Rebel Returnees; and 
m) Victims of armed conflict.  

 

4.7 The Regional Offices shall ensure that none of the children of the livelihood 
beneficiaries are engaged in child labor. Further, beneficiaries of the 

Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) and the government 

employees, including those at the local government units, are not eligible to 

avail of the program. 

 

4.8 Further, Section 7 of  the same DO states that beneficiaries of the 
Kabuhayan Program shall be provided with working capital in the form of 

raw materials, equipment, tools and jigs, and other support services 

necessary in setting-up the business. Likewise, liquidation of fund 

assistance released shall be undertaken within sixty (60) days upon 

completion of the project, that is, upon acceptance of assistance by the 

beneficiaries.  

 

4.9 Section 12, Paragraph D3 of DOLE DO No. 173 series of 2017 provides 
that, all equipment purchased shall be the property of DOLE, to be turned 



156 
 

over to the proponent Accredited Co-Partner (ACP) after one (1) year from 

the start of project implementation through a Deed of Donation, provided 

that the project is still in operation. If the project ceases to operate within 

the 1 year period, the PO/FO shall recommend to the Regional Office that 

said equipment be pulled out from the Proponent-beneficiary/proponent 

ACP. 

 

4.10 The ROs shall ensure that the funds under regional allocation for Capacity 
Building Program for Specific Sectors and DOLE AMP (DILP and 

TUPAD), including its administrative cost, shall be solely used for the 

implementation of the KABUHAYAN and TUPAD Programs. 

 

4.11 Further, A.1 of DOLE Memorandum dated May 24, 2018 re: Clarifications 
on Some Provisions of the DO 173-17 specifically states that, the Barangay 

Tanods and JO personnel are not entitled to avail of livelihood assistance 

under the DILP if they are receiving their salaries from government funds.

4.16 The three regular programs namely: TUPAD, DILP or KABUHAYAN 
Program and GIP had a total budget of ₱7,538,911,000.00, per GAA. Due to 

the implementation of CAMP and TUPAD #BKBK which is separately 

discussed in this report, portion of the budget for the three programs were 

realigned totaling ₱4,677,797,101.08, resulting in adjusted allotments of 

₱2,861,113,898.92. Details are as follows:

4.17 As at December 31, 2020, out of ₱2,861,113,898.92 allotments of the three 
programs, it is worthy to note that  ₱2,683,751,158.49 or 93.80 percent was

4.18 Results of the reports per program submitted by the BWSC and BLE which act 
as Program Managers of DILEEP and GIP, respectively, showed that from 

438,465 target number of beneficiaries with an allotment of ₱2.8 billion, the 

Department has managed to exceed their targets with 611,520 beneficiaries in 

CY 2020 or a total increase of 39.47 percent due to shortening the period of 

employment or  internship to accommodate more beneficiaries pursuant to the 

Department Order  No. 210 series of 2020 dated March 18, 2020  and GIP-

4.19 Pursuant to Memorandum issued on March 24, 2021 which took effect 
retroactively on December 01, 2020, the DOLE RO X is granted with authority 

to implement the TUPAD Program thru the ACPs, such as LGU, among others, 

in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Of 

the ₱29,792,000.00 received for TUPAD and GIP, ₱14,250,000.00 or 48 percent 

was released to Bayang, Lanao del Sur, an LGU under the BARMM for the 

2,969 underemployed/self-employed/displaced workers of that LGU. 

 



159 
 

4.20 The said Memorandum emanated from Section 13, Article VI or RA No. 11054 
which mandates the national government to make available and shall continue to 

be funded its programs and projects in BARMM areas and Executive Order (EO) 

No. 70, Series of 2018 or an Act Institutionalizing the whole-of-nation approach 

in attaining inclusive and sustainable peace, creating a national task force to end 

local communist armed conflict, and directing the adoption of a national peace 

framework, and for other purposes. 

 

4.21 Other observations noted in the implementation of the programs of the 
Department are as follows: 

 

Table 42: Other Observations in the Implementation of the Programs 

Office Particulars 

IX Various liquidation reports only contain the Statement of Receipts 

and Disbursements (SORD) as received by the LGU or NGA 

resident auditor to support the liquidation of the fund transfers. Those 

enumerated in Section B.15 of the MOA are no longer provided or 

submitted to the RO, which is contrary to the agreements set forth by 

the parties and limits the information that is needed by the RO in the 

monitoring of the equipment procured, distributed, and ultimately to 

be donated after the lapse of one year as provided in DOLE DO No. 

173 series of 2017. Non-preparation and maintenance of such 

monitoring also make it difficult for the RO to account for the 

equipment to establish and determine accountability over the 

properties pending its donation. 

  

However, an interview with the focal persons disclosed that while 

there are some government ACPs that prepare an Acknowledgement 

Receipt signed by the beneficiary upon release of the items and duly 

witnessed by a DOLE representative, such document is no longer 

provided to the FOs for file and reference. Further, it has also been 

the practice that only the Terminal Report with photo-documentation 

and the SORD, are required to be submitted by the ACPs to liquidate 

fund transfers. 

X There were unclaimed payments of ₱715,900.00 for grants in CYs 

2017 to 2018 still at the possession of the MLFSI, but were 

recognized under the account Other Receivables of the RO. The 

Management finally sent a Letter Request to MLFSI on October 29, 

2020 for the refund, but to no avail.   

 

Moreover, review of the MOA entered into between DOLE Region 

X and MLFSI disclosed that there was no provision regarding the 

automatic refund to the RO for any unclaimed remittances. 

Furthermore, there was also no provision on the period to which 

MLFSI has to refund to the RO for the unclaimed balances. 



160 
 

 

4.22 We commended the Department for the unconditional efforts in 
implementing the programs, projects, and activities under its mandated 

functions despite the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, to contribute to 

the government’s agenda of inclusive growth thru massive job generation 

and poverty reduction. 

 

4.23 However, we recommended and the Management agreed to require the: 
 

a. RO IX direct the Field Office Focal Persons to: 
 

 coordinate with the respective ACPs and require compliance with 
the MOA on the submission of the liquidation report with all 

supporting documents, particularly the submission of the 

acceptance/acknowledgement receipt by the beneficiaries of the 

raw materials, and/or equipment, tools and jigs; and 

 

 prepare and maintain a monitoring report of all equipment 
distributed to the beneficiaries of the concerned ACPs for 

accounting and accountability purposes; 

 

b. RO X to: 
  

 include in the MOA with the MLFSI provisions on the holding 
period for the unclaimed amounts and the responsibility of 

reporting the same to the RO;  
 

 improve their communication and information drive system to 
ensure that all beneficiaries are duly informed of the availability 

of payment, including the period within which beneficiaries are 

allowed to claim; and 
 

 conduct regular monthly monitoring on unclaimed payments. 
 

4.24 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

IX Management already sent a Memorandum informing the FO Focal 

Persons to remind the ACPs to comply with the provisions of the 

MOA and submit all pertinent documents together with the 

liquidation reports. 

X Management accepted the recommendations and had already issued 

a Memorandum relative to the subject.  The unclaimed payments of 

₱715,900.00 were just recently refunded by MLFSI, however, 

Management has yet to set down with the latter for the additional 



161 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

provisions of refund after a specific period.  

 

Unremitted cash balances to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) 

 

5. The balances of the trust receipts and collections of registration fees of ROs V 
and XIII totaling ₱18,694,840.72 were unremitted to the BTr, contrary to 

Sections 6 and 10 of the General Provisions of GAA, Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 or 

Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 and EO No. 338, s. 1996; thus, depriving the 

national government of the proper disposition of these funds. 

 

5.1 Pertinent general provisions of RA No. 11465 states that:  

 

 Section 6. Trust Receipts. The following shall be deposited with the 
National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in accordance with 

E.O. No. 338, s. 1996, as implemented by COA-DOF J.C. No.1-97 

dated January 2, 1997, and such other guidelines issued thereon: 

 

a) Receipts collected or received by departments, bureaus, offices, 
and instrumentalities of the National Government including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs: (i) 

from non-tax sources, such as insurance proceeds, acting as 

trustee, agent or administrator; (ii) as a guarantee for the 

fulfillment of an obligation; or (iii) from donations authorized 

by law or contract with a term not exceeding one (1) year; and 

 

b) Those classified by law or regulations as trust receipts.  
 

Xxx 

 

 Section 10. Reversion, Closure, and Transfer of Balances of 
Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving Funds, and 

Unauthorized Accounts. Departments, bureaus, offices, and 

instrumentalities of the National Government, including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are 

mandated to close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, 

Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving Funds to the General Fund in 

any of the following instances: (i) when there is no legal basis for 

its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they 

are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for 

which said funds were established. 

 

Xxx  

 

5.2 EO No. 338 dated May 17, 1996 also requires that all government offices 
and agencies to immediately transfer all public money deposited with 



162 
 

authorized government depository banks (AGDBs) and other institutions to 

the BTr regardless of income source. As provided in COA-DBM-DOF Joint 

Circular No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997, after remittance to the National 

Treasury (NT) has been effected and a report thereon has been submitted to 

COA, DBM and BTr, the agency may request for issuance of Notice of Cash 

Allocation (NCA) from the DBM.

these funds are still active. 

 

Internal Control System  

 

6. Deficient observance by the CO-POLO Hongkong and Riyadh,  DOLE CAR 
and RO IX of the Internal Control System (ICS) on the proper 

handling/safekeeping, monitoring and accounting of cash 

collections/disbursements, property accountability, accountable forms, and 

official documents indicates non-compliance with Sections 123 and 124 of the 

Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and applicable rules and regulations, thus 

risk of loss of funds, properties and documents may not be prevented.   
 

6.1 Sections 123 and 124 of the PD No. 1445 provide the following: 
 

 Section 123. Definition of internal control. Internal control is the 
plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures 

adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, 

check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and 

encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies. 

 

 Section 124. Installation. It shall be the direct responsibility of the 
agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of 

internal control.

PD No. 1445 provides: 

 

Section 101.1 - Every 

officer of any 

government agency 

whose duties permit or 

require the possession or 

custody of government 

funds or property shall be 

accountable therefor and

shall be done upon 

properly itemized invoice 

and receipt which shall 

invariably support the 

clearance to be issued to 

the relieved or outgoing 

officer, subject to 

regulations of the 

Commission.” 

IX Review of the issued ORs and checks of the 

Cashier disclosed that several of these accountable 

forms were issued by the Assistant Cashier, 

instead of the Cashier. 

 

Interview with the Cashier revealed that Office 

Order No. R09-2020-05-037 dated May 6, 2020 

was issued designating an Assistant Cashier in the 

anticipation of the Cashier’s one-month work-

from-home (WFH) schedule from June 1 to June 

30, 2020. During this time, the Assistant Cashier 

issued ORs for collections and checks for 

disbursements. 

 

Verification of the events and procedures 

undertaken, also showed that these accountable 

forms were transferred to the physical custody of 

the Assistant Cashier without proper itemized 

invoice and receipt (transmittal) such that the 

accountability for the forms remained with the 

Cashier. Such fact was also not disclosed in the 

Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms 

(RAAF). 

Expired Fidelity Bond of an AO

custody of government 

funds or property shall be 

accountable therefor and

be properly bonded in 

accordance with law. 

the fidelity bond of the AO with Risk Number 57-

19-2356N has already expired as of July 4, 2020. 

Interview disclosed that the bond was no longer 

renewed because the AO will be retiring effective 

December 31, 2020. However, from the date of 

the lapse of the coverage of the bond on July 4, 

2020 to the date of the cash count, on October 13, 

2020, the AO continued to perform disbursement 

functions such that there remains a need to have 

the AO properly bonded. 

Non-maintenance of the Checks and ADA Disbursements Record (CkADADRec) 

Section 10 of Chapter 6, 

Volume 1 of the GAM 

for NGAs provides: 

 

“Sec. 10. Accounting 

Books, Records, Forms

ng and 

Riyadh 

ORs in POLO-Hongkong and Riyadh, revealed 

deficiencies such as not properly filled up date, 

name of payor and amount.   

 

Further, in POLO-Riyadh, ending balance of 

accountable forms contained in the RAAF does 

not reflect the correct amount thereof. 

Improperly maintained Daily Time Record (DTR)/Review by the immediate supervisor 

 CO Deficiency noted in the payment of hazard pay 

 Lack of initial/signature or unsupported 
alterations in the DTR; 

 Seven employees were observed to have 
missing time logs in their DTRs making it 

impossible to check their arrivals and 

departures 

 Certification of service without 
countersignature of claimant’s immediate 

supervisor 

 

6.3 We recommended and the Management agreed to require: 
 

a. concerned POLOs to explain the noted deficiencies in the issued ORs, 
deposit of collections, make the necessary corrections and submit the 

revised RAAFs and BRSs; 

 

 

 

 



169 
 

b. CO to: 
 

 direct the Director of HRDS to make the necessary measures to 
correct the deficiencies noted in the DTRs of the concerned 

employees and officials; and 

 concerned officials to submit the necessary certification of 
service duly signed by their immediate superiors to ensure that 

sound internal control is put in place; 

 

c. CAR to properly accomplish/fill-up the POs with all the necessary 
details following COA Circular No. 96-010; and 

 

d. RO IX to: 
 

 direct the Cashier to issue ORs for collections made in strict 
numerical sequence in compliance with Section 4.h Chapter 2- 

General Provisions, Basic Standards and Policies, GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I;  

 maintain only a reasonable number of ORs as determined by the 
Cashier and return the rest of the ORs to the Supply Officer to 

lessen the possibility of confusion in the issuance of the ORs; 

 require the Cashier to surrender all unused and returned 
accountable forms to the Property Officer for safekeeping, 

monitoring and control;  

 require the Cashier to prepare and maintain the CRRec and 
CkADADRec as required under GAM for NGAs to facilitate the 

determination of her accountability and proper monitoring of the 

undeposited collections at any given time; 

 require that all AOs, in case of transfer, have properly transferred 
his/her accountability and not merely its physical custody; and 

 require that all AOs are properly bonded in accordance with the 
provisions of P.D. No. 1445 relative to the fidelity bond. 

 

6.4 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

CO Management committed to comply with the audit recommendations. 

CAR Management had issued a memorandum relative to the proper 

accomplishment of the POs to all Field Office Heads and Division 

Chiefs to comply with the audit recommendations. 

IX On OR not issued in strict numerical sequence 
 

Management provided copies of transmittal letters for details as 

to the actual date of return of the ORs from different FOs. These 

were used and exhausted before the new sets of ORs were 



170 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

purchased that resulted in several issuances appearing not in 

numerical and chronological order.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team concurs with the comment of the Management; 

however, apart from those ORs described above, there were 

other instances when the issuance of such accountable form was 

not done numerically. 

 

On non-maintenance of the CRRec for collections and deposits 

 

Management commented that collections and deposits are 

already recorded in our Financial Management System (FMS), 

from that data we will update our FMS to enable it to generate 

CRRec. Further, management already directed the Cashier to 

coordinate with the IT personnel and facilitate the preparation 

and maintenance of the CRRec by the end of March 2021, in 

addition to the current practice of recording all collections and 

deposits electronically in our FMS. 

 

On transfer of custody of accountable forms without money 

value 

 

The Cashier was not relieved of her position during the 

extraordinary time caused by COVID-19. She continued to 

discharge her functions while working from home in compliance 

with health and safety protocol being a senior citizen. Hence, 

management saw no reason to turn over the said accountable 

forms to the designated Assistant Cashier, since the use and the 

issuance of ORs and checks were properly coordinated with the 

Cashier. Further, they will direct the Cashier to comply with 

your recommendation to disclose any transfer of custody of 

accountable forms in the RAAF. 

 

On expired fidelity bond of an AO 

 

Management committed to ensure that his replacement and all 

other AOs are properly bonded following the provisions of P.D. 

No. 1445 relative to the fidelity bond of accountable officers. 

 

On non-maintenance of the CkADADRec 

 

Management commented that disbursements thru Check and 

ADA are recorded in the FMS, thus, the balance of the bank 



171 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

account can be verified in real-time. Further, Management 

directed the Cashier to comply with your recommendation to 

prepare and maintain the CkADADRec under the 

Garnishment/Trust Fund, in addition to the current practice of 

recording all disbursement electronically in our FMS. System 

updates of the FMS will also be performed by the Technical 

Division of the Office.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The audit team verified the FMS to check outstanding balances 

of the Trust Fund/Garnishment Account and noted that there 

were errors in the balances presented by the system such that 

despite the maintenance of such system, monitoring of the 

account balance cannot be performed.   

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances (CAs) 

 

7. Insufficient observance of the laws, rules, regulations in the granting, 
utilization, and liquidation of CAs under COA Circular No. 97-002 and 

Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 resulted in unliquidated CAs totaling 

₱1,572,152,901.75 even if their purpose had already been served; thus, 

exposing public funds to possible risk of misuse and non-recording of related 

expenses within the period these were incurred.  

 

7.1 Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 7, 1997 requires 
that all CAs shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. 

 

7.2 While Section 4.4.2 provides that the amount of the CA shall be limited to 
the requirements for two months. Within five days after the end of the 

month, the AO shall submit a Report of Disbursements.  Additional CAs 

shall be granted on the basis of the activity budget or the requirements for 

two months, whichever is lower.  

 

7.3 Section 5.5 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
defines Dormant Unliquidated CAs as advances granted to Disbursing 

Officers, agency, officers and employees, which remained non-moving for 

ten years or more where settlement could no longer be ascertained. 

 

7.4 While Section 7.0 on Specific Guidelines provides that the Accountant shall: 
 

7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation 
of the existence of the receivables, liquidated CAs, and fund 

transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable 

officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting 



172 
 

Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing government 

entities concerned; 

7.2 Prepare aging of dormant receivables, unliquidated CAs, and fund 
transfers on a quarterly basis to support the request for write-off, 

and indicate in the Remarks column the existence of the applicable 

conditions, as follows: 

 

a. Absence of records or documents to validate/support the claim 
and/or unreconciled reciprocal accounts; 

b. Death of the accountable officer/employee/debtor; 
c. Unknown whereabouts of the accountable 

officer/employee/debtor, and that he/she could not be located 

despite diligent efforts to find him/her; 

d. Incapacity to pay or insolvency; 
e. Exhaustion of all possible remedies by the Management to 

collect the receivables and to demand liquidation of CA and 

fund transfers; and 

f. No pending case in court involving the subject dormant 
accounts. 

 

7.5 Moreover, Section 8.2 of the same Circular provides that the Head of the 
government entity shall file the request for authority to write off dormant 

receivable accounts, unliquidated CAs, and fund transfers to the COA Audit 

Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor. 

 

7.6 Meanwhile, Memorandum No. 2020-019, which prescribes the Guidelines 
in the Financial and Compliance Audit of the COVID-19 Funds during the 

period of the State of National Emergency provides the following:  

 

Section III – General Guidelines  

 

10. Any unused/unexpended balances of the COVID-19 funds shall 

be remitted by the Agency to the National Treasury upon 

completion of the P/A/P. 

 

7.7 Section 1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 on the Revised Guidelines and 
Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions 

provides specific requirements for CAs. 

 

7.8 Pertinent provisions of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 
are as follows: 

 

 Section 4.5 states that every officer, agent and employee 
accountable for public funds shall be liable for all losses resulting 

from the unlawful deposit, use or application thereof, and for all 

losses attributable to negligence in the keeping of such funds 



173 
 

hence, his accountability for the funds must be covered by fidelity 

bond which shall ensure security thereof and be available for the 

purpose of replacing defalcations, shortages, unrelieved losses in 

the accounts of bonded public officers. 

 

 Section 7.3 states that any increase in the amount of accountability, 
resulting to an increase in the amount of bond shall be subject to 

increase in premium.  Section 7.3.2 further states that the amount of 

bond premium shall be computed based on the increased amount of 

bond.  The bond shall take effect upon the time of payment of 

premium on the new bond application. 

 

7.9 Advances accounts represent CAs granted to: a) Labor Attachés for the POLOs’ 
operations; and b) various AOs for special purpose/time-bound undertakings, 

official travels, and implementation of DOLE CAMP, TUPAD #BKBK and 

AKAP to cushion the impact of CoViD-19 pandemic. 

 

7.10 The unliquidated CAs as at December 31, 2020 of ₱1,572,152,901.75 is

Late Liquidation of CAs 

NCR Various CAs remained unliquidated at year-end even if their 

purpose had already been served. 

9,428,312.25 

I Advances to SDOs account for the implementation of TUPAD 

and other DOLE programs/projects/activities, were not fully 

liquidated at the end of the year. The bulk of unliquidated CAs 

were granted in December 2020 for the payment of TUPAD 

wages under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 

2). Management explained that this was due to the late release 

of funds from the DOLE CO and that CAs were resorted to by 

the Agency for the payment of TUPAD wages due to the cash 

payout request of LGU Officials specially on remote areas with 

no nearby remittance center, to facilitate faster processing of 

payment transactions to program beneficiaries. 

35,883,080.00 

III The RO chose to distribute assistance to specified beneficiaries 

of TUPAD program under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act 

through direct implementation and through CAs. The granting 

of CAs to officers and employees was not adequately 

controlled, resulting in the accumulation of outstanding CA 

balances as of July 31, 2020. 

93,099,102.80 

IV-B The submitted Status Report on Outstanding CAs as of 

December 31, 2020, revealed that several CAs granted to SDOs 

remained unliquidated at year-end.  

 

The Management was advised by the DOLE CO to 

immediately release the program funds to the respective FOs to 

hasten the distribution of grants and salaries to the intended 

beneficiaries, thus CAs were granted to SDOs despite the non-

settlement of their previous CAs. 

17,852,407.14 

VI CAs for travel and special purpose activities were still not 

liquidated as of year-end. 

 

The Advances to SDOs of ₱4,932,610.00 is composed of the 

balance of the account of the former DO of Iloilo Field Office 

for the implementation of the JobStart Philippines Program of 

₱32,610.00 granted in CY 2018 and the CA of financial 

assistance to sugar industry workers affected by the preventive 

measures on COVID-19 granted in CY 2020 amounting to 

₱4,900,000.00.

186,971.00 

Total 1,618,038.60 

 



176 
 

7.13 We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the concerned Accountants to send demand letters to AOs, 
with outstanding balances as well as to the resigned/retired AOs to 

strictly enforce the submission of liquidation documents as soon as 

the purpose for which the CA was granted has been served and 

refund simultaneously any excess amount thereof, otherwise, cause 

the withholding of salaries pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 

dated February 10, 1997, and update records to facilitate proper 

monitoring; 

 

b. stop the practice of granting additional CAs to AOs with 
outstanding unliquidated CAs;  

 

c. necessitate adjustment of the AOs’ bond application in accordance 
with their actual monthly average accountabilities and furnish the 

Audit Team the cancelled bonds of the AOs as a result thereof;  

 

d. stop the granting of CA to the Regional Director and Assistant 
Regional Director for special purposes;  

 

AO/ILAB Dir. to: 

 

e. explain why some expenses incurred were charged to her CA even 
prior to the authority to handle CA was given; otherwise, the said 

expenses will be disallowed in audit; and 

 

f. regularly monitor the liquidation/settlement of outstanding advances 
for those AOs who are currently assigned to POLOs. 

 

7.14 The Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comment 

CO The Management informed that the expenses incurred prior to the 

authority to handle CA, were used during the TWG meetings on  

July 25 and September 10, 2019. TWG meetings were conducted 

as early as July 2019 due to the urgent need to review the various 

legislative proposals pending in the Senate and House of 

Representative as per Administrative Order No. 279, series of 

2019 

NCR The Management, through the IMSD Chief, instructed the 

Accounting Unit to determine the AOs with outstanding balances 

as of March 24, 2021, and issue demand letters that requires 

immediate liquidation of CAs or refund of unused balances, and 

require the AOs to settle unliquidated cash advances before 

granting additional cash advances. 



177 
 

Office Management’s Comment 

III Per validation from the Finance Unit, as of July 31, 2020, the 

outstanding CA issued to the Disbursing Officer amounts to only 

₱2,630,025.25 based on the recorded Liquidation Reports 

submitted by the SDOs.  However, said Liquidation Reports 

were not submitted on time by the Finance Unit resulting in the 

issuance of said audit observation.  Management has already 

instructed the IMSD/Finance for the immediate submission of all 

Liquidation Reports to the Audit Team.  To minimize the 

issuance of CAs, Management will utilize other modes of 

payment including established monitoring schemes on 

liquidation requirements by service providers. 

IV-B As of March 11, 2021, the amount of ₱14,175,199.43 was 

already liquidated out of the ₱17,852,407.14 cash advances. 

Demand letters were issued to SDOs with outstanding cash 

advances dated February 4, 2021. 

VI The Accountant informed that the second and final demand letter 

for Ms. Jornada was already sent to her new address. Moreover, 

the ₱4,900,000.00 CA of Ms. Cagbaleno was already liquidated 

in February 2021 and will be recorded in the 1st quarter of CY 

2021 reports. As for the JobStart CA, a memo will be issued to 

the concerned official in April 2021. Lastly, as their adherence 

with the COA recommendations, Memorandum No. 294 dated  

November 3, 2020 was issued to all concerned personnel and will 

be reiterated by Management this CY 2021. 

XIII On granting of additional CA to AOs with unliquidated 

balances 

 

Management commented that due to the directive from the CO to 

utilize cash as at year end, the Office has to incur CAs. 

Nevertheless, the Management committed to undertake 

corrective actions so that this deficiency will not recur in the next 

calendar year. 

 

On CA granted to approving authorities 

 

The Management commented that the observations are valid and 

that they acknowledged the deficiency. However, they reasoned 

that they had to incur CAs to follow the directives from the CO, 

and that is to ensure utilization of funds downloaded to them. 

The Management nevertheless promised to do their best to 

implement the recommendations.

Unliquidated Fund Transfers 

 

8. Fund transfers to NGAs, NGOs/CSOs, LGUs and GOCCs for the regular 
operations totaling ₱1,106,350,662.13 remained unliquidated for more than 

one year to less than 10 years due to the deficient monitoring of 

program/project completion and liquidation by the Implementing Agencies 

(IAs) contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, and 

2007-001 dated October 25, 2007.  

 

While, fund transfers to LGUs for the implementation of  Coronavirus Disease 

2019 (COVID-19) program under the Tulong Panghanapbuhay Para sa Ating 

Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers #Barangay Ko, Bahay Ko! 

(TUPAD#BKBK) amounting to ₱50,836,476.00 remained unliquidated as of 

December 31, 2020, which raised doubts in ascertaining whether the allocation 

for the program was used for its intended purpose. 

 

8.1 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, which prescribes the 
rules and regulation in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds 

transferred to IAs, requires the following: 

 

4.6 Within ten days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 
period for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCIs and the 

Report of Disbursements (RDs) to report the utilization of the 

funds.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA. 

 

4.7 The Source Agency (SA) shall draw a Journal Voucher to take 
up the reports. 

 

4.8 The IA Auditor shall audit the disbursements out of the trust 
accounts in accordance with existing COA Regulations. 

 

4.9 IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion 
of the project while paragraph 5.4 provides that the SA shall 

require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a 

copy of the journal entry voucher (JEV) taking up the 

expenditures. 

 

8.2 On the other hand, COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 
provides for the revised guidelines in the granting, utilization, accounting 

and auditing of the funds released to NGOs/CSOs for the implementation of 

government projects. Pertinent provisions of the said Circular are as 

follows: 

 

5.4 The signing officials of the Government Organizations (GO) to 
the MOA shall cause close monitoring and inspection of project 

implementation and verification of financial records and reports 



179 
 

of the NGO/PO, and shall ensure compliance with the 

provisions of the MOA and of this Circular. 

 

5.5 Within sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the 
NGO/PO shall submit the final Fund Utilization Report certified 

by its Accountant and approved by its President/ Chairman to 

the GO, together with the inspection report and certificate of 

project completion rendered/issued by the GO authorized 

representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/ 

acknowledgment of the project/ funds/ goods/ services received. 

The validity of these documents shall be verified by the internal 

auditor or equivalent official of the GO and shall be the basis of 

the GO in recording the fund utilization in its books of accounts. 

These documents shall support the liquidation of funds granted 

to the NGO/PO. 

 

8.3 Moreover, Section 12 (d) of DOLE Department Order (DO) No. 173, s. 
2017 on the implementation and liquidation of livelihood and emergency 

employment projects, states among others that: 

 

D.2. TSSD/PO/FO or the Accredited Co-Partner (ACP) shall 

facilitate/ conduct the necessary trainings. 

 

D.5. The PO/FO-SDO or the ACP, as applicable, shall fully  

liquidate the cash advance within 60 days upon completion of 

the project, that is, upon acceptance of assistance by the 

beneficiaries. 

 

8.4 Moreover, COA Memorandum No. 2020-019 dated dated November 9, 
2020, which prescribes the Guidelines in the Financial and Compliance 

Audit of the COVID-19 Funds during the period of the State of National 

Emergency provides the following: 

 

Section III – General Guidelines 

 

10. Any unused/unexpended balances of the COVID-19 funds shall 

be remitted by the Agency to the National Treasury upon 

completion of the Projects/Activities/Programs. 

 

8.5 The unliquidated fund transfers as at December 31, 2020 of 
₱5,218,288,617.26 is composed of the following:

The above fund transfers were made from April to September 2020. The 

outstanding balance remained unliquidated despite the lapse of the 

completion date of the disinfection/sanitation project and period to liquidate 

due to the non-submission of the proponent ACP/LGU of the required 

worker’s profile and liquidation reports with supporting documents such as 

payroll, pictures, certificates of project completion and attendance sheet, 

which is contrary to the conditions outlined in the MOA and the 

abovementioned COA Circular. Moreover, the delayed or non-submission 

of liquidation reports upon completion of the project is tantamount to non-

monitoring of the project implementation, which is a responsibility of the 

RO as expressly stipulated in the MOA. 

 

8.9 The inability of the ROs to consistently monitor the status of payments 
made to the beneficiaries and compel the concerned ACP/LGUs to regularly 

submit the LRs of the funds transferred within the prescribed period resulted 

in the accumulation of outstanding balances and raised doubts in 

ascertaining whether the allocation for the program was used for its 

intended purpose, that is, to provide temporary wage employment for the 

underemployed, self-employed workers and displaced marginalized workers 

who have lost their livelihood or whose earnings were affected due to the 

ECQ against COVID-19. 



184 
 

8.10 We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

On regular operations: 

 

a. ensure compliance with the requirements prescribed under DOLE 
DO Nos. 36-02, s. 2002 and 173, s. 2017 and COA Circular Nos. 94-

013 and 2007-001 on the implementation, monitoring and 

liquidation of funds released to LGUs, NGAs, NGOs/CSOs and 

GOCCs;  

 

b. direct the Program Officers concerned to cause the immediate 
submission of terminal/liquidation reports within the prescribed 

periods by the ACPs and to closely monitor the implementation of 

projects to ensure that the objective of the projects is attained, and 

that any deviations are addressed immediately; 

 

c. instruct the Technical Support and Services Division Chief to 
compel the concerned LGUs to: i) return the unused balance of the 

fund of the completed projects to settle the funds transferred, 

particularly those with long outstanding accounts; and ii) consider 

instituting  appropriate sanctions on defaulting LGUs for non-

liquidation of fund transfers (RO IVB); 

 

d. continuously exert extra effort to send demand letters to NGAs, 
LGUs, NGOs/CSOs and GOCCs with outstanding balances for the 

immediate settlement/liquidation of their accounts and copy 

furnish the same to COA; 

 

On fund transfers for the implementation of TUPAD #BKBK: 

 

e. demand for the immediate liquidation by the respective 
LGUs/ACPs of the fund transferred ; and 

 

f. immediately refund any unutilized portion of the funds. 
 

8.11 Management commented, thus: 

 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

CO Management is continuously sending demand letters to NGAs, 

LGUs, NGOs/CSOs with outstanding balances. 

IV-A The Management commented that almost half of the amount 

have already been liquidated but is yet to be removed from the 

books. They also commented that since some of the amounts 

were utilized by the previous administrations, they had difficulty 

in monitoring them. The Management stated that some of the 



185 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

NGOs/CSOs have already closed and that LGUs sometimes do 

not respond to their follow-ups. Nevertheless, the Management 

promised compliance with the audit recommendation by first 

forming a Liquidation Team to follow-up and liquidate the 

outstanding receivables and monitor their status as well as 

upcoming liquidations. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Office of the Auditor will continuously monitor the 

compliance of the Management with the recommendations. The 

Management’s action plan will be requested and that a copy of 

their monitoring will be requested for the Auditors to validate the 

status of our own monitoring. 

IV-B LGUs in RO IV-B will comply with the submission of the 

liquidation reports. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Management is reminded to regularly validate and monitor 

the settlement of fund transfers despite the current pandemic 

situation. 

VI Regular Operations 

 

As to Management’s adherence with the COA recommendations, 

Memorandum No. 034 dated January 25, 2021 was issued to set 

the monthly deadline of the updated status of liquidation by each 

Field Offices (FOs). A google drive tracker was created to be 

accessed by each FO and Division focal persons.

Management informed the Audit Team that Memorandum Order 

No. 023 dated January 15, 2021 was issued to expedite the 

submission of completed Liquidation Reports of fund transfers to 

various LGUs under Bayanihan I and II. The concerned FOs 

were also directed to submit the liquidation from ACPs on or 

before January 22, 2021. 

VIII As of March 22, 2021, the unliquidated balances for Due from 

LGUs - ₱10,146,500.00

Management is encouraged to issue demand letters for the 

liquidation of the cash advances and fund transfers and to refund 



186 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

any unexpended balances thereof. 

IX Management has previously issued directives for the Task Force 

Liquidation to conduct regular inspection/monitoring covering 

current and prior year projects to fast-track liquidation of 

livelihood grants. Further, in the last DILP Focals’ Meeting last 

March 15, 2021, it was already discussed that the FOs will 

coordinate with debtors as to the liquidation of fund transfers and 

draft letters have been prepared. Management is committed to 

comply with the other recommendations as stated. 

X As of February 23, 2021, out of the ₱9,821,676.00 unliquidated 

fund transfers to LGUs, the amount of ₱4,979,404.00 has been 

liquidated and the amount of ₱56,474.00 was remitted to the 

BTr. The RO has issued demand letters to the LGUs for the 

immediate settlement of fund transfers. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

As of March 12, 2021, only ₱2,931,378.00 out of the 

₱4,979,404.00 liquidations have been submitted. 
 

Dormant Asset and Liability Accounts 

 

9. Dormant balances of asset and liability accounts totaling ₱167,802,088.61 remained 
in the books due to insufficient actions by Management on account balances, 

contrary to COA Circular Nos. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 and 97-001 

dated February 5, 1997, thus balances of both accounts could no longer be 

ascertained, and collections of receivables ceased to be probable. 

 

9.1 Pertinent provisions on the dormant receivables and payables accounts are 
as follows: 

 

 COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 was issued 
to prescribe guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning 

the books of accounts of NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs of dormant

by the source entity to implementing entity for the 

implementation of programs/projects which remained non-

moving for ten years or more and where settlement could no 

longer be ascertained. 

 

 Item 7 thereof provides the specific guidelines on the reporting, 
monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to be performed by 

the Accountant. Item No. 8 provides the procedures in requesting 

write-off of dormant accounts and emphasis on Item 8.3 of the said 

Circular, requiring that the request for write-off shall be supported 

by the following documents: 

 

a. Schedule of dormant accounts by the accountable 
officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by 

the Accountant and approved by the Head of the government 

entity; 

 

b. Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the 
conditions, as applicable, such as: 

 

1. Death Certificate issued by Philippine Statistics Authority 
(PSA); 

2. Proof of Insolvency; 
3. Certification from the Department of Trade and Industry 

(DTI) that the debtor has no   registered business;

returned demand letters; 

7. Certification by the Legal Officer of the entity of no 
pending case relative to the account; 

8. Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to 
the effect that there are no records/documents available to 

validate claim; 



188 
 

9. Other justifications like in the case of request for write-off 
due to loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss 

should be stated in the letter-request; and 

10. In case of fund transfer, the unliquidated amount after 
reconciliation shall be supported by certification by the 

Chief Accountants and approved by the Heads of the 

source and implementing entities that the fund was utilized 

for the purpose, and certification from the recipient that 

the project was partially or fully implemented, supported 

by pictures of the implemented projects. 
 

 COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 provides the 
guidelines on the proper disposition/closure of dormant funds 

and/or accounts of NGAs and failure of the officials/employees 

concerned to comply thereof shall subject to administrative 

disciplinary action in accordance with the provisions of Section 

122 (2), Chapter 3, Title III, PD 1445 and Section 55, Chapter 10, 

Sub-title I-B, Book V of EO No. 292, series of 1987, of the Revised 

Administrative Code of the Philippines. 
 

 Item 1 of Section II of the said Circular defines Dormant Accounts 
as individual or group of accounts which balances remained non-

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

CO Management commented that they will request for authority to 

write-off upon completion of the documents. 

NCR The Management, through the IMSD Chief commented that 

they have instructed the Accountant to submit to COA the 

request for write-off on the accounts that are outstanding for 

more than two years. 

I Management committed to comply with the audit 

recommendation. 

IV-A Management commented that almost half of the amount has 

already been liquidated, but is yet to be removed from the 

books. They also commented that since some of the amounts 

were utilized by the previous administrations, they had 

difficulty in monitoring them. The Management stated that 

some of the NGOs/CSOs have already closed and that LGUs 

sometimes do not respond to their follow-ups. Nevertheless, the 

Management promised to comply with the audit 

recommendation by first forming a Team to follow up and 

liquidate the outstanding receivables and monitor their status as 

well as upcoming liquidations. 

 



194 
 

Office Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Office of the Auditor will continuously monitor the 

compliance of the Management with the recommendations.  

IV-B The Management issued a Memorandum No. IMSD-21-02-23-

04 to FOs to submit status and necessary documents for the RO 

to request a write-off of dormant accounts. Also, the 

management created a committee thru Office Order No. 04 

series of 2021 to ensure a systematic tracking of 

implementation of projects. 

VI The Write-off Committee per Office Order No. 428 dated 

November 18, 2020, has already started last November 24, 

2020, and a Plan of Action had been submitted by each FO to 

be implemented this 2021. Lastly, a follow-up memorandum 

will be issued this April 2021 to remind and fast track the 

submission of necessary documents required for write-off. 

IX Management has previously given directives for the Task Force 

Liquidation to conduct regular inspection/monitoring covering 

current and prior year projects to fast-track liquidation of 

livelihood grants. Further, in the last DILP Focals’ Meeting last 

March 15, 2021, it was already discussed that the FOs will 

coordinate with debtors as to the liquidation of fund transfers 

and draft letters have been prepared. Management is committed 

to complying with the other recommendations as stated. 

XIII The Management concurred with the recommendations and 

promised to comply. 
 

Cash Bonus Fund (CBF) 

 

10. The insufficient reporting, monitoring, validation, and coordination with the 
concerned stakeholders by the BWSC on the shares, distribution and balances 

of the CBF resulted in the accumulation of  undistributed CBF of 

which ₱161,331,914.80 is deemed forfeited in favor of the socioeconomic 

programs for sugar workers according to Section 9 of RA No. 6982 dated May 

1, 1991, thus, affecting the full attainment of the program’s objective of 

augmenting the sugar workers income to enjoy decent living for themselves 

and their families and the reliability of the status report of the  CBF as of 

December 31, 2020. 

 

10.1 To strengthen the rights of the workers in the sugar industry and for them to 
augment their income to enjoy decent living for themselves and their 

families, a ₱5.00 lien per picul shall be imposed on the gross production of 

sugar and shall have an automatic additional of one peso (₱1.00) for every 

two years for the succeeding ten years from effectivity pursuant to Section 7 



195 
 

of RA No. 6982 dated May 1, 1991. Further, 80 percent of the lien shall be 

distributed as cash bonus in proportion to the service rendered by the 

workers which were collected by the sugar millers and released to the 

planters’ associations for distribution to the workers. 

 

10.2 Salient provisions of RA No. 6982 state the following: 
 

Section 7. Lien; Distribution; Collection and Remittance. – 

 

a)  Effective crop year 1991-1992 a lien of Five pesos (₱5.00) per picul 

of sugar shall be imposed on the gross production of sugar to 

primarily augment the income of sugar workers, and to finance 

social and economic programs to improve their livelihood and well-

being: provided, that there shall be an automatic additional lien of 

One peso (₱1.00) for every two years for the succeeding 10 years 

from the effectivity of this Act: provided, further, that the Secretary 

of Labor and Employment may, upon the recommendation of the 

STC, suspend or reduce the amount of the automatic additional lien 

herein authorized whenever circumstances occur adversely affecting 

or causing undue increases in the cost of producing sugar, taking into 

consideration the declared policy of this Act. 

 

The amounts herein imposed shall be borne by the sugar planters 

and millers in proportion to their corresponding milling share and 

said amounts shall constitute a lien on their sugar quedans and/or 

warehouse receipts. 

 

b)  Eighty percent of the lien, including any and all incomes or interests 

derived therefrom, shall be distributed as cash bonus to each worker 

in the sugar farm or mill based on the proportion of work rendered 

by him. The cash bonus share of the worker shall be collected by the 

sugar mills and released to planters’ associations in the case of 

affiliated planters, or directly to unaffiliated planters, for distribution 

to their respective workers. The cash bonus share of the mill workers 

shall be held in trust by the mills for distribution to the workers. 

 

The remaining 20 percent of the lien shall be collected by the sugar 

mills and to be remitted to the DOLE and utilized pursuant to 

Section 10 hereof. 

 

c) The collection of the lien shall be made upon the withdrawal or 

release of the sugar from the mill warehouse but in no case beyond 

180 days from the date of the issuance of the corresponding sugar 

quedans or warehouse receipts: provided, that, after said 180 days, 

the miller shall advance whatever amount is necessary to pay such 

lien and charge the holder of said sugar quedans or warehouse 



196 
 

receipts the amount so paid and such reasonable rate of interest as 

may be prevailing in the banking community. 

 

d)  It shall be the duty of every sugar mill to remit the lien collected 

within one month from the date of collection thereof; otherwise, a 

penalty of ten percent per month on the unremitted collection shall 

be imposed upon the violator. 

 

The cash bonus portion of the lien shall, in turn, be distributed to 

sugar workers concerned within one month from the date of 

remittance; otherwise, a penalty of ten percent per month on the 

undistributed cash bonus shall be imposed upon the violator. 

 

All penalties for non-remittance of lien collected shall accrue to the 

social and economic programs for the sugar workers. Such penalties 

for non-distribution of the cash bonus shall accrue to the sugar 

workers concerned. 

 

Section 9. Undistributed Cash Bonus-Any undistributed amount due the 

workers shall, within three months, be remitted to and held in trust by 

the DOLE for a period of three years from the date of remittance, after 

which it shall be deemed forfeited in favor of the socioeconomic 

programs for sugar workers. 

 

It shall be the duty of the Secretary of Labor and Employment to make 

at least three publications before the end of said three-year period and to 

make the corresponding radio announcements in radio stations 

operating in the area to inform the beneficiaries concerned regarding 

their unclaimed cash bonus. The said publications shall be made 

through local newspapers and by posting in conspicuous public places 

in the area where the concerned beneficiaries reside. 

 

The forfeited amount, including its interests, shall be utilized for 

projects or programs in favor of the sugar workers as recommended by 

the STC. 

 

Section 13. Penal Sanctions.- Any person who intentionally violates 

Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 14 of this Act, and any of the rules promulgated 

under Section 11 hereof, shall be penalized with imprisonment of not

Five thousand pesos (₱5,000.00) but not more than Twenty thousand 

pesos (₱20,000.00) or both.

association or any other entity, the penalty shall be imposed upon the 

entity's responsible officers, including, but not limited to, the president, 



197 
 

vice-president, chief executive officer, general manager, managing 

director or partner. 

 

10.3 Audit of the CBF showed the following deficiencies: 
 

a) Undistributed and forfeited amount of ₱161,331,914.80; and 
 

10.4 The BWSC-CO consolidated and submitted to the Audit Team the 
Summary Report of CBF Collection, Remittances, Releases, and 

Distribution under RA No. 6982 from different BWSC ROs as of 3rd 

quarter of CY 2020, which showed an aggregate of ₱422,770,186.77 CBFs 

for Crop Years 1991-2020 were undistributed to the sugar workers and still 

with the Mill/PAs/Coops/PMs. Details are as follows:

b) Insufficient reporting, monitoring, validation, and coordination with the 
concerned stakeholders, and non-submission of documents to support 

the CBF status report. 

 

10.6 Our audit revealed that the Management failed to maintain accounting 
records to properly monitor the distribution of 80 percent CBF that resulted 

in the accumulation of undistributed and forfeited amount. No other 

accounting reports were maintained by the Bureau except for the 

consolidated summary report of CBF submitted by the ROs. 

 

10.7 Moreover, the Management still needs to have a proper and thorough 
reporting of the CBF status which could be done thru adequate monitoring, 

validation and coordination with all the concerned stakeholders, to come up 

with a more credible fund status report. 

 

10.8 We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

a. coordinate with the ROs on the monitoring of the compliance by 
the concerned Mills/PAs/Coops/PMs on the distribution of the 

CBF, validation of the undistributed CBF and forfeited amount, 

and intensify the distribution and remittance thereof; otherwise 

institute appropriate actions on the defaulting 

Mills/PAs/Coops/PMs; 

 



199 
 

b. require the Accounting Divisions of both the ROs and the BWSC-
CO to have a detailed and updated CBF status report per RO for 

control and monitoring purposes and submit the same to the Audit 

Team, for verification; and 

 

c. coordinate with the STC to include in their regular meetings the 
issues raised and to come up with a resolution that will monitor and 

prevent the accumulation of unreleased/undistributed CBF. 

 

10.9 Management commented that the Bureau will request the concerned DOLE 
ROs to review their reports and coordinate with the concerned industry 

stakeholders relative to the status of implementation of the SAP-Cash Bonus 

Program (CBP). 

 

10.10 The concerned DOLE ROs will submit to the Bureau a quarterly report on 
the Status of CBP Implementation pursuant to RA No. 6982 which in turn

Irregular, Unnecessary and Excessive Expenditures  

 

11. Non-compliance with COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 or 
Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, 

Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures resulted in 

irregular/unnecessary/excessive expenditures totaling ₱7,735,157.31. 
 

11.1 Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 or 
Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, 

Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures define 

the following: 
 

 Section 3.1 “Irregular” Expenditures- an expenditure incurred without 
adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, 

policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. 

Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without 

conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline. There is no 

observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, 

or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction 

conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does 

not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction 



200 
 

which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, 

likewise, irregular. 
 

 Section 4.1 “Unnecessary” Expenditures - an expenditure which could 
not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a 

family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the 

service. Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the 

implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to 

the nature of its operation. This would also include incurrence of 

expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and 

those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time. An 

expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with 

without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary. The 

mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the expenditures must be 

considered in determining whether or not expenditure is necessary. 
 

 Section 5.1 “Excessive” Expenditures - unreasonable expense or 
expenses incurred at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price. It 

also includes expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well 

as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or 

amount. They also include expenses in excess of reasonable limits. 

 

11.2 Post-audit of disbursements revealed that a total of ₱7,735,157.31 is deemed 
irregular, unnecessary and excessive expenditures due to non-compliance with 

the applicable rules and regulations on government expenditures stated hereunder 

in the following offices:

by a certification executed by the official concerned that the 

expenses sought to be reimbursed have been incurred for any of the

11.4 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

NCR Management commented that starting April 2021, all OICs with 

plantilla position receiving RATA will continue to enjoy the said 

benefit. Recording of the said RATA will be corrected as 

commutation. Only OICs who hold plantilla positions from 

another Region or Office which was clearly stated in the Office 

Order to receive reimbursable RATA, as well as the Mediator-

Arbiter will receive reimbursable RATA. 

III Management through the IMSD - Finance Unit will be 

conducting Re-orientation to Focal Persons/Administrative Staff 

of all Provincial FOs including its Satellite Offices on the 

allowable traveling expenses and per diems to be reimbursed 

based on the provisions of EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2017. 

  

Management will also remind the Finance Unit to immediately 

recompute claims for TEVs and per diems to minimize, if not, 

eliminate excessive claims.   

  

Excessive claims observed during post-audit shall be deducted 

from succeeding claims in coordination with the personnel 

involved. 

V Management committed that the claims for EME will now be 

supported with receipts, other documents evidencing 

disbursements, and the required certification.  

  



205 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

During the exit conference, the Accountant explained that the 

misclassified accounts were charged to the Representation 

Expense account because that was the expense account stated in 

the Advice of Disbursement Limits (ADLs) received from the 

Head Office.    

  

Auditor’s Rejoinder 
  

A perusal of the ADL for CY 2020 on file, showed that there 

were only two ADLs with Representation Expense specified as 

the expense to be charged: ADL Nos. 2019-12-2062 and 2020-

02-0915 with amounts of ₱36,000.00 and ₱10,000.00, 

respectively, to be expended for Representation Expenses. 

 

XI Management contends that had it not been for these medical 

supplies and equipment, the RO's labor inspectors, program 

holders, and other frontliners may have already gotten sick from 

COVID-19 exposure. 

  

A COVID-19 Exposure Preparedness and Response Plan crafted 

by the RO, various regional issuances, certain provisions of the 

Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA), and the Occupational 

Safety and Health Standards for the Public Sector were among 

their references. 

 

The Management also pointed out that the procurement of the 

above items was made in good faith, and without intention to 

disregard nor violate the provisions of NBC 580, and only made 

in response to fear and threat of COVID-19 infection. They 

added that no cases of COVID-19 infection and symptoms were 

reported among the RO employees due to these purchases and 

testing made. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Though the Management reported zero COVID-19 cases within 

their offices, the Management’s attribution of this to the 

procurement of air purifying equipment and flu vaccine may 

only be coincidental in the absence of professional medical 

opinion that supports this claim. 

  

The Audit Team also believes that the COVID-19 Exposure 

Preparedness and Response Plan and other issuances by the 

Regional Director (RD) cannot be used as legal bases to support 

the procurement of the above items, as the RD has a higher 



206 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

office, in the person of the Secretary, from whom authority will 

be sought for their transactions and activities, especially in the 

case of the above items which are not being regularly procured 

by the RO. 

  

The Audit Team will evaluate how the CNA and the 

Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Public Sector 

would weigh in consideration of the spirit and provisions of 

COA Circular 2012-003 and NBC No. 580. 

  

In addition, the Audit Team welcomes additional legal bases that 

the Management would like to submit for consideration and 

evaluation. 

 

Compliance with RA No. 9184  

 

12. Procurements in RO I totaling ₱1,761,053.00, done thru shopping and small 
value procurement, were not supported with proof of posting to the PhilGEPS 

website,  while in RO V,  aside from its failure to post the Requests for 

Quotations and the Notices of Awards, the procurement of meals, 

accommodations, transportation, and supplies and materials with Approved 

Budget for the Contracts (ABCs) above ₱50,000.00 were not properly 

documented to ascertain further the propriety of procurements,  contrary to 

the provisions on the alternative of procurements of the IRR of RA No. 9184 

and other related rules and regulations.  

 

12.1 Annex H of R.A No. 9184 and the revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (IRR) of 2016 provides the Consolidated Guidelines for the 

Alternative Methods of Procurement, which shall be resorted only in the 

highly exceptional cases provided for in the Guidelines, and subject to the 

prior approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity upon recommendation of 

the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC). In all instances, the

documentary requirements, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, pertinent 

provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and other 

related rules and regulations, thus legality and propriety of the recorded 

transactions cannot be immediately established. 

 

13.1 Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that “Claims against government 
funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

13.2 COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the revised

of such declaration; or (2) the income payment exceeds ₱3M, 

despite receiving the sworn declaration from the income payee. xxx 

 

13.5 Item No. 5.14 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides

I Management immediately instructed the SDOs and the FO Heads 

during the exit conference to comply with the audit 

recommendations. 

 

They will issue a memorandum to the concerned personnel in 

charge with the procurement for immediate compliance. 

III The quarterly payment was made by the Finance Unit due to the 

difficulty in securing or late receipt of the monthly Statement of 

Accounts (SOA) from the internet service provider (Globe) as the 

basis of payment and to prevent discontinuity of services which 

may affect efficient and effective delivery of services. 

 

The IMSD has already made representation with the service 

provider to substantiate such payment made and shall be 

transmitted to the Audit Team.

14.9 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the 
concerned offices to strictly comply with the preparation and

other reports in compliance with GAM for NGAs and other relevant 

COA rules and regulations within the prescribed period; and if 

warranted, suspend the payments of salaries of those responsible AOs 

who failed to submit reports on time until they have complied with the 

requirements on the submission of reports. 

 

14.10 Management commented, thus: 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 CO The Management committed to comply with the audit 

recommendations. 

NCR Contracts 

 

Management commented that they have already required the 

Office of the BAC to submit the necessary documents such as 

contracts and bid documents in compliance to the audit 

recommendations. 

 



226 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

POs 

 

The Management, through the IMSD Chief, instructed the 

Supply Officer to furnish COA with copies of POs issued 

together with supporting documents within five days after 

perfection thereof and delivery documents/IARs within 24 hours 

after acceptance of deliveries of goods and services; and POs to 

be attached to the DVs are stamped “Received” by the Audit 

Team. 

 

Financial Reports 

 

The Management, through the IMSD Chief, instructed the 

Accountant to strictly follow the deadlines set in the submission 

of reports and observed the recommendation of COA. The 

Management further promised to adhere with the timely 

submission of the monthly, quarterly and annual reports. 

CAR Management had issued a Memorandum relative to the proper 

accomplishment of the POs and the submission of such within 

the prescribed period, to all Field Office Heads and Division 

Chiefs to comply with the audit recommendations. 

I Management promised to comply with the audit 

recommendations. They will look into the personnel complement 

of the Accounting Division to address the problem and 

committed to submit the DVs within a week time. 

II Management replied that the delay was because of the 

unprecedented health crisis and concomitant declaration of a 

Luzon-Wide ECQ which affected the operations of NGAs, 

among others. That Government Offices were then operating 

under a skeleton workforce, while others opted for other work 

arrangements (i.e. work from home, online transactions, etc.) in 

compliance with IATF protocols and guidelines. Also, because 

the Office has been swamped with volumes of transactions 

amidst the pandemic and community quarantine, and due to the 

prompt response of DOLE, through its CAMP and TUPAD 

programs, to elevate the plight of the affected workers in the 

private sector, resulting in the belated submission of the said 

reports. However, Management assured the Audit Team that they 

will be more circumspect about the timely submission of 

monthly financial reports with complete supporting documents. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Management is still required to submit the financial reports 

immediately for audit purposes. 



227 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

III Financial Accountability Reports 

 

As of February 15, 2021, said required FAR Nos. 1, 4, and 5 

were already submitted to the Resident Auditor. 

 

POs/Contracts 

 

Management is committed to strengthening its monitoring and 

compliance with existing rules and regulations particularly on the 

requirements of the COA.  Duties and responsibilities of critical 

personnel with specific output indicators as to quality and 

timeliness shall now be incorporated in their respective 

Individual Performance and Commitment Review (IPCR).  

Likewise, specific processes shall be reviewed and analyzed as 

part of our continual improvement of our Quality Management 

System (QMS) under the ISO 9001:2015. 

 

BRS 

 

Per validation with the Finance and Accounting Unit, the late 

submission of the BRSs is mainly due to the late receipt of Bank 

Statements and/or inaccessibility of bank statements through the 

online system “we access”.  As an alternative, Management has 

directed the cashier, whenever applicable, to request snapshots of 

transaction ledgers/records in cases of non-availability of said 

system.  Further, Management has also requested the Finance 

Unit to update the submission of BRSs by end of the month. 

 

IV-A The Management submitted the DVs and its supporting 

documents to the Office of the Auditor. The Management also 

assured that this deficiency shall not be repeated. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The submitted DVs and its supporting documents are being 

checked for completion and for post audit. Monitoring will be 

made by the Office of the Auditor to ensure continuous 

compliance of the timely submission. 

V DVs 

 

Management committed that they will adhere to the 

recommendations and will submit the paid vouchers for the 

month of December 2020 on or before March 31, 2021. 

 

 



228 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

BRS 

 

Management will request for the Bank Statements for the Nurses 

Assigned at Rural Services and Special Program for Employment 

of Students.  Likewise, follow-up was already made from the 

depository banks. 

 

Management also stated that they have already submitted the 

BRS for the Trust Fund No. 0615-005824-080 and the Accounts 

Payable Account No. 2013-9033-55 for the year 2020. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

DVs 

 

As of March 19, 2021, a transmittal was received by the 

Auditor’s Office, transmitting the RCI for the LBP-MDS 

Account No. 2013-9033-47 and the Paid Vouchers for the said 

RCI.  However, the DVs were not submitted yet contrary to the 

transmittal made.   

 

During the exit conference, the Accounting Unit committed to 

submit the DVs for December 2020 not later than the 2nd week 

of April, 2021. 

 

BRS 

 

The Trust Fund BRS was not included by the Audit Team in the 

seven bank accounts without BRS because it was received by the 

Audit Team prior to the issuance of the AOM. 

VI During the exit conference, the Accountant informed that the 

required RPCI will be submitted within the month of April 2021 

and that the required forms be maintained and reconciliation be 

done periodically by the Supply Officer and the Accountant.   

VII FSs /DVs 

 

The Management to submit the FSs and commented that they 

will be in full coordination to expedite the scanning of DVs and 

the submission thereof; require employees to render overtime if 

needed or create a committee for the specific purpose. 

Commitment on the submission is April 15, 2021 for the DVs for 

CY 2019, and April 30, 2021 for DVs for CY 2020. 

VIII The delayed submission of Journals, DVs or supporting 

schedules/documents, receipts, liquidation reports and TBs was 

primarily caused by lack of personnel in the Cashier’s Section to 



229 
 

Office Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

do the segregation of disbursement vouchers. The situation was 

worsened by the implementation of alternative work 

arrangements due to the pandemic. But the management 

committed to provide additional personnel who will be assigned 

to do the segregation of DVs to hasten submission of reports to 

COA. 

XIII DVs/JEVs 

 

The Management concurred with the recommendations and 

assured compliance thereof. 

 

 

Audit of POLOs by COA Deployed Auditors 

 

15. The POLO is the DOLE’s link to the world.  It is directly under the Office of the 
Secretary of Labor. It acts as the operating arm of DOLE for the administration and 

enforcement of its policies and programs applicable to the OFW. At present there 

are 37 POLOs situated in various countries in Asia (13), Middle East (13), Americas 

(4) and Europe (7). 

 

POLO Programs 
 

15.1 There are five general programs being implemented by all POLOs; namely: 
 

a. Employment Facilitation – under this program, services include: 
 

 Verification of employment contracts; 

 Verification and issuance of other documents such as job orders, 
special power of attorney (SPA), and other employment–related 

documents;

 Labor market information 
 

b. Employment Preservation - this program helps keep our OFWs safe 
from harm and protect their rights in the host country, services 

include: 
 

 Welfare Services - in coordination with OWWA, extends its legal 
services to the OFWs that includes, counseling, custodian legal 

assistance, referral, repatriation, visits to hospitals/jails and others;

including holidays 
 



230 
 

c. Employment Enhancement - various programs are being 
implemented to better the lives of our OFWs and their families 

 

d. Policy Development and Formulation - the POLOs have the 
responsibility to update the DOLE on significant economic, political, 

cultural and social developments and policy innovations in the host 

country that may be relevant to the Philippines labor interests, directly 

or indirectly. 
 

e. Networking, linkages, and information dissemination 
 

15.2 In addition, as a result of the ECQ and/or declaration of the State of Public 
Health Emergency due to COVID-19, the DOLE issued DO No. 212 dated 

April 8, 2020, Prescribing Guidelines on the Provision of Financial 

Assistance for Displaced Landbased and Seabased Filipino Workers “AKAP 

for OFWs”, and DOLE DO No. 212-A, series of 2020 Supplemented 

Guidelines on the Provisions of “AKAP for OFWs”. 

 

15.3 The POLO office is headed by Labor Attaché II, assisted by Labor Attaché l with 
three staff: interpreter (local hire), processor and Clerk. 

 

15.4 Due to COVID-19 pandemic, for CY 2020, no COA Audit Teams were deployed 
to audit the Foreign-Based Government Agencies (FBGAs), including selected 

POLOs of DOLE. 

 

15.5 The results of audit that were transmitted to DOLE Management and to their 
respective POLO officials pertained to CYs 2017-2019 FBGAs-POLOs audit.

15.7 The scope of audit pertained to the cash and property accountabilities of the POLO 
Administrative Officers. This included the audit of cash advances and its 

utilization, recording and preparation of financial reports as well as evaluation of 

the programs/projects, with the summary of audit observations and 

recommendations, to wit:  

    

Table 63: Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

Al Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 

The CDReg was not properly filled-up, 

without entries on the details of cash 

advances received and their balances, thus 

the expenses incurred therein cannot be 

matched against the corresponding cash 

advance resulting with high probability in 

recording error in the books of the HO and 

improper use of the cash advances. 

Furthermore, no file of CDReg was 

retained in the Post. 

We recommended that: 

 

 the Administrative Officers fill-up 
completely all the portions in the 

CDReg on all cash advances received 

to readily monitor the status of cash 

advances received and expended and 

the proper recording thereof in the 

books of account; and 

 complete set of documents, 
particularly on the receipt and 

expenditure of cash advances, be 

maintained in the Post. 

Cash advances granted to previous LabAtts 

remained unliquidated with an aggregate 

amount of ₱3,803,021.94 although they 

have already been reassigned to other 

Posts. 

We recommended that the Post ensure 

that all cash advances of the LabAtts are 

monitored and fully liquidated before 

leaving the Post due to retirement/ 

reassignment. 

The discrepancy between the RPCPPE of 

the Post and the RPCPPE of the DOLE-

HO was due to the inclusion of missing 

items totaling SR2,205.00 and equipment 

with total cost of SR215,429.00 in the Post 

report and exclusions therein of missing 

vehicle costing SR2,900.00, which is 

included in the report of the HO. Also 

reported in the RPCPPE instead of RPCI 

are semi-expendable items totaling 

SR33,267.35, contrary to Section 10, 

Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 

I. 

We recommended that the Post: 

 

 reconcile its RPCPPE with that of the 
DOLE-HO and ensure that both 

reports are adjusted accordingly; 

 apprise the DOLE-HO about the 
missing, damaged and unserviceable 

inventory items that have been 

damaged due to aged, wear and tear 

and request for the cancellation of the 

ICs after determining the property and 

its disposal; 

 reclassify and report as Semi-
expendable inventories the properties 

amounting to SR33,267.35 or 

₱452,435.96 which were erroneously 

classified and reported as PPE; and

 immediately inform the Philippine 
Embassy in Riyadh of the presence of 

unused ballots and for the Embassy to 

inquire from the COMELEC on the 

proper action to be taken for the 

disposal of the said items. 

The reported accomplishments of the Post 

were not substantially supported with 

details and documents hence, casting doubt 

on their accuracy and validity. The 

propriety of target-setting cannot also be 

ascertained. 

We recommended that the Post maintain 

records with complete details to support 

its accomplishments and validate the 

propriety of its target-setting if they are 

realistic compared with the 

accomplishments. 

Tel-Aviv, Israel 

The adjusted balances of CIB per BRS as 

of October 31, 2019 appear unreliable in 

view of the non-inclusion of the 

undeposited collections for the month of 

October 2019 as reconciling item. 

We recommended that the Post to 

include undeposited collections in the 

BRS as deposits in transit to reconcile the 

balances per book and per bank. 

The Fidelity Bond for the accountability of 

the CO appeared insufficient to cover the 

maximum amount of accountability he 

handled, thus, disadvantageous to the 

government and contrary to Treasury 

Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 

2009 issued by the BTr.  

We recommended that the Post make 

representation to the DOLE-HO for the 

increase of the amount of the bond of Mr. 

Agravante. 

The Post prepared only one RPCPPE for 

all types of PPE, contrary to the provisions 

of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 

We recommended that the Post to 

prepare a separate and categorized 

RPCPPE in accordance with the GAM 

for NGAs. 

Of the 139 items listed in the RPCPPE, 93 

items had acquisition costs below the 

threshold amount of ₱15,000.00 to be 

classified as PPE, in accordance with 

Section 10, Chapter 8, and Sections 3 and 

4, Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs, Volume 1. 

We recommended that the Post to 

properly reclassify the 93 items included 

in the RPCPPE based on the threshold 

amount prescribed under the GAM for 

NGAs. 

The RPCPPE included five items 

described as “unserviceable”. However, 

while these were likewise reflected in the 

Post’s IIRUP, the latter was not submitted 

to the HO as basis for the request of 

authority for the disposal of these items 

and their eventual removal from the books 

of accounts of the Post and accountability 

of the concerned AO. 

We recommended that the Post to 

forward the IIRUP to the HO for 

approval and for the proper disposal of 

the unserviceable properties and their 

eventual dropping from the books. 

Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 

The Fidelity bonds of the Administrative 

Officers were insufficient to cover their 

accountabilities as provided under COA 

Circular No. 2006-05 dated July 13, 2006 

and Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated 

August 6, 2009, which may expose the 

government to risk of not being adequately 

We recommended that the LabAtt 

inform the HO about the sufficiency of 

the current fidelity bonds of Collecting 

Officer/SDO and to update said bonds, if 

necessary; and regularly deposit 

collections and liquidate the cash 

advances to prevent the accumulation

thereof. 

Collections of VFs were not deposited 

intact daily or the next banking day 

contrary to Section 69 of PD No. 1445 and 

Section 3.7.2 of DOLE-DFA-DBM-DOF-

COA Joint Circular 3-99 dated September 

28, 1999, thereby exposing collections to 

undue risk of loss or possible misuse. 

We recommended that the LabAtt closely 

monitor/supervise the deposit of daily 

collections pursuant to Section 69 of PD 

No. 1445 and DOLE-DFA-DBM-DOF-

COA Joint Circular 3-99 and other 

regulations pertaining thereto. 

 

Liquidation of Cash Advances was delayed 

and not in compliance with Section 4.1 and 

5.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997 thereby exposing cash 

advances to the risk of possible loss or 

misuse pending liquidation thereof. 

We recommended that the 

Administrative Officers liquidate their 

cash advances and refund any excess 

immediately after the purposes have been 

served. Compliance by concerned POLO 

with the timely liquidation of cash 

advances be monitored by the DOLE-

HO, with applicable sanctions to be 

imposed, if warranted. 

Procurement of property was not in 

accordance with the Guidelines for the 

Procurement of Goods and Services, 

Infrastructure projects, and consulting 

services to be procured and performed 

overseas of the GPPB Resolution No. 28-

2017 dated July 31, 2017, specifically 

under Annex A of said Resolution which 

provides the requirements/documents to be 

complied/conducted by the procuring 

entity in its procurement activity. 

We recommended that the procurement 

of goods and services be made in 

compliance with the guidelines 

promulgated under GPPB Resolution No. 

28-2017 dated July 31, 2017. In case the 

alternative mode is resorted, POLO 

should secure a recommendation from 

the BAC of the Head Office or competent 

authority in charge in the project 

implementation and/or procurement. 

Expenditure for fuel (Gasoline) used by 

the Post service vehicles for the period 

covering August 2018 to June 2019 were 

not properly reported, controlled and 

accounted. 

We recommended that the POLO 

observe proper control and accounting 

on the use of government service vehicles 

and the fuel expenses incurred, by 

properly accomplishing a duly 

authorized driver’s trip ticket for every 

official travel, which should be pre-

numbered with the data on Odometer 

reading at the beginning and end of each 

trip and number of liters of gasoline 

consumed. 

The RPCPPE included properties no 

longer in existence at the Post/station 

without appropriate request/application for 

relief from property accountability as 

required under Section 73 of PD No. 1445 

otherwise known as the Government 

Auditing Code of the Philippines. 

We recommended that the POLO 

coordinate and appropriately report said 

non existing properties to the DOLE-HO 

to facilitate action and submission of the 

requirements needed, for relief from 

accountabilities and ultimately dropping 

from its inventory records/accounts. 

Semi-expendable properties and 

unserviceable properties are still included 

in the RPCPPE. 

We recommended that the POLO: 

 

 prepare a separate report on semi-
expendable properties for the PPE 



234 
 

Table 63: Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

below the threshold of ₱15,000.00; 

 to record as expenses upon issuance 
and properly monitored the ICS; 

 report unserviceable properties in the 
IIRUP; and 

 request for authority from HO for the 
disposal of unserviceable property 

that can no longer be repaired. 

The Post was unable to come up with an 

accurate/realistic target based on historical 

data for their Programs/Activities/Projects 

in the Annual Integrated Physical and 

Financial Plan for CYs 2017 to 2019; thus, 

a disproportionate difference in the targets 

against its accomplishments. 

We recommended the POLO to provide a 

realistic target based on historical data to 

determine the efficiency and proficiency 

in the implementation of the programs 

and activities at the Post. 

 

The Post was unable to generate all the 

reports as prescribed in the GAM for 

NGAs and DOLE Administrative Order 

No. 168-13; thus some of the transactions 

at the POLO were not recorded using the 

FLOIS data storage program, hence 

data/information generation is not 

efficient, reliable and readily available. 

We recommended that the Post 

coordinate with the DOLE-HO for the 

implementation of the FLOIS system in 

the Post, and raise its issues and concerns 

to thresh out solutions for its successful 

implementation and operations. 

 

The Post personnel is inadequate to 

provide the necessary services at the 

MWOFRC as required under Section 42 of 

Administrative Order No. 168-13 (POLO 

Manual), thus it does not sufficiently 

address the need of the OFWs at the 

Center on time. 

We recommended that the Post 

coordinate with the DOLE-HO for the 

hiring and providing the qualified and 

needed personnel/services to fully attend 

the needs and welfare of our OFWs at the 

MWOFRC Center. 

Singapore 

The submission of the CDReg to the 

DOLE-HO was delayed by two to three 

months and was not properly maintained, 

thus the timely recording in the books of 

the DOLE-HO of the disbursement 

transactions of the POLO could not be 

made. 

We recommended that the 

Administrative Officers remind the 

personnel in-charge to properly maintain 

and submit the CDReg upon liquidation 

of the cash advances. 

The fidelity bond of the AO expired on 

August 20, 2019, thus his accountabilities 

were not insured against loss for one 

month until its renewal on September 19, 

2019. 

We recommended that the 

Administrative Officers remind the 

concerned official of DOLE-HO at least a 

month before the expiry of the fidelity 

bond for its renewal. 

The target for six performance indicators 

were not fully accomplished with 

performance ranging from a low 25 to 72 

percent while in five indicators, the 

accomplishment was much higher than the 

targets ranging from 159 to 701 percent, 

indicating that in target-setting, not all 

factors have been considered to arrive at 

reasonable and attainable targets. 

We recommended that the POLO: 

 consider all factors and previous year’s 
accomplishments in target-setting for a 

more realistic and attainable targets in 

all its performance indicators and to 

avoid wide discrepancies between 

planned activities and 

accomplishments; and 

 report in each performance indicator 



235 
 

Table 63: Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

the activities that cut across various 

indicators if they were considered in 

the target-setting. 

The Post has successfully responded to the 

needs of the OFWs through the programs 

of OWWA and DOLE which impressive 

performances may, in the future, be 

affected by the relocation of the 

MWOFRC and the lack of computer unit 

to implement the FLOIS. 

We recommended that the Post make 

representation with the: 

 

 Urban Redevelopment Authority 
(URA) to allow the Post to lease a place 

that is conducive for the 

implementation of POLO/OWWA 

programs that will upgrade the skills of 

the OFWs housed in the Center; and 

 DOLE-HO to include in the budget the 
purchase of another computer in order 

to fully utilize the system and facilitate 

the preparation of other reports. 

Tokyo, Japan 

Collections on the issued OEC were not 

deposited daily to an authorized depository 

bank, contrary to Section 28 of COA 

Circular No. 92-382 and Section 32 of the 

Revised Cash Examination Manual, 

thereby exposing government funds to 

possible loss or misappropriation. 

We recommended that the collections be 

deposited in a local bank account, 

provided that opening such account is 

allowed in Japan and that the costs of 

opening and maintaining a new bank 

account is practical, taking into 

consideration the amount of daily 

collections. Otherwise, keeping the daily 

collections in the vault pending the 

monthly remittance is justified, as long as 

the necessary controls to secure the 

money are in place. 

Three pieces of ORs could not be located, 

and unused OECs are still in the 

possession of the Post which may be 

susceptible to loss or misuse. 

We recommended that the Post report 

the missing ORs, and seek advice from 

the DOLE-HO on the proper disposition 

of the unused OEC forms. 

Semi-expendable items of supplies or 

property with estimated useful life of more 

than one year but fall below the 

capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 are 

included in the RPCPPE, in contravention 

of Section 10, Chapter 8 and Appendix 66 

of the GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and II. 

We recommended and the Post agreed to 

comply on the proper reporting of PPE 

and semi-expendable assets. Remove the 

supplies or property with values below 

the ₱15,000.00 threshold from the 

RPCPPE and report in a separate RPCI. 

The POLO Service Transaction Modules 

in the FLOIS are functional and operating 

properly, but the POLO Financial 

Transaction Modules, except the 

liquidation report, are not being used 

because the Post has no access to the same. 

We recommended for the DOLE-HO to 

provide personnel to access the relevant 

Financial Transaction Modules, coupled 

with the necessary safeguards to 

maintain the integrity of the system and 

the accuracy of the information encoded 

and generated. 

 

Macau, Special Administrative Region 

The CRRegs and CDRegs maintained by 

the Administrative Officers were not in 

accordance with the format prescribed 

We recommended that the LabAtt to 

strictly comply with the format of the 

CRReg and CDReg as prescribed under 



236 
 

Table 63: Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

under Sections 39(d) Chapter 5, and 

Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

Likewise, the liquidation reports were 

delayed ranging from 30 to 90 days, thus, 

accountability could not be immediately 

determined. 

the pertinent provisions of the GAM for 

NGAs. 

Unissued and pre-signed ORs by the 

previous LabAtt were not cancelled and 

still in the possession of the incumbent 

LabAtt. Likewise, several ORs were 

cancelled mostly due to errors committed 

by the CO. 

We recommended that the LabAtt to: 

 

 cancel the pre-signed ORs; 

 request from the DOLE Secretary the 
designation of OWWA Administrative 

Officer of Deputized CO for OECs; 

and 

 prepare/submit Report of 
Accountability for Accountable Forms 

regularly. 

The required supporting documents for the 

payment of salaries of local hire 

employees were not complied with, hence 

the claim against government funds were 

not fully substantiated contrary to Section 

5 of PD No. 1445. 

We recommended that the LabAtt 

require the local hires to quantify their 

outputs in the Accomplishment Reports 

and strictly observe the provision of PD 

No. 1445, to facilitate the performance 

evaluation of the said employees. 

Small tangible properties costing below the 

capitalization threshold totaling 

MOP21,457.00 or USD2,438.41 were 

misclassified under PPE accounts in 

violation of Section 4, Chapter 10 and 

Section 10, Chapter 8, GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I. Likewise, some unserviceable 

properties were not included in the IIRUP, 

thus, the propriety and correctness of the 

said report was compromised. 

We recommended that the LabAtt to: 

 

 exclude the various small tangible 
properties from the RPCPPE and issue 

the corresponding ICS to the user to 

for accountability, and 

 report the unserviceable properties in 
the IIRUP, and immediately request 

for the disposal thereof. 

The target for CYs 2017 to 2019 were 

either as high by 90 percent or low by 875 

reported percent compared with the 

accomplishment, indicating inadequate 

planning of activities thus, the Post 

performance cannot be fairly assessed. 

We commended the Post for surpassing 

the outputs but it would have been more 

comparative had the targets particularly 

the Workers Information, Education and 

Communication Program (WIECP) were 

set at reasonable numbers of activities for 

an objective and fair assessment of 

performance of the Post. We also advised 

the Post to continuously monitor the 

programs/activities/project to ensure the 

safety/welfare of the OFWs. 

Rome, Italy 

POLO collections from VFs were not 

deposited intact and on a daily basis, while 

collections for OEC amounting €2,688.00 

were not remitted within the prescribed 

period, contrary to Administrative Order 

No. 190, series of 2012 and Section 64 

(M), (O) and Q of AO No. 168 series of 

2013. 

We recommended that the LabAtt: 

 comply with the provisions of the 
DOLE Administrative Order No.190, 

series of 201 and Section 64 (M), (O) 

and Q of Administrative Order No. 168 

series of 2013 in depositing daily 

collections from VF intact on the next 

banking day and remitting daily 



237

collections of OEC to POEA within the 

prescribed period as well as charging 

the bank fees against the MOOE funds; 

 account for the difference of €184.00 on 
the collection and remittance from the 

OEC fee; and 

 open an exclusive account for OEC 
collections so that it may be used for 

deposits of POEA collections and 

thereafter on a monthly basis for said 

bank to transfer the collections to the 

authorized depository bank in the 

Philippines. 

Cash advances for operating expenses 

under the Special Accounts–Locally 

Funded account amounting to ₱565,163.85 

remained unliquidated since December 31, 

2018 or for 10 months already due to the 

Post’s negligence in the submission of 

liquidation documents, contrary to COA 

Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 

1997, and erroneous recording of its 

liquidation amounting to €5,179.32 

pertaining to the July and August 2018 

MOOE. 

We recommended that the Labatt to: 

 

 cause the immediate return of the 2018 
MOOE balance amounting to 

USD283.24 or €245.26 to the VF Fund; 

 require the Administrative Assistant to 
cause the immediate refund of the 

unused allowance of €999.09; 

 henceforth, comply with the provision 
of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997 requiring full 

liquidation of all cash advances at the 

end of each year and refund of any 

unexpended balance; 

 adopt the prescribed format of the 
CDReg for a detailed reporting of the 

grant, utilization and liquidation of 

cash advances. Further, maintain a 

central file per year of the monthly 

CDReg. 

For the DOLE HO – Accounting 

Division, to effect the necessary 

adjustment on the overpayment of Hotel 

Allowance to the Administrative 

Assistant amounting to €999.07 and

restrictions, to the detriment of the 

We recommended that the LabAtt, in 

coordination with DOLE-HO, make a 

request to POLO–Milan to transfer the 

funds credited to their account to POLO 

– Rome.  

 

We also recommended that the DOLE–

HO exercise due care and diligence in 

preparing inter-fund transfer 

memorandum which should reflect the

government. accurate details of bank accounts and 

purpose of the fund transfers to avoid 

similar occurrence in the future. 

The Report on the Semi-Expendable 

Equipment/Property includes two 

unserviceable properties; while the 

acquisition cost of 16 items not indicated 

therein thereby casting doubt on the 

accuracy and validity of the report. 

Further, six unserviceable properties were 

not reported in the IIRUP as required 

under Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I. 

We recommended that the designated 

Property Officer be required to: 

 

 indicate the acquisition cost of all 
properties presented in the inventory 

report; 

 prepare a separate report for 
unserviceable properties in accordance 

with Section 42 (h), Chapter 10 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 exclude the unserviceable items in the 
Report on the Semi-Expendable 

Equipment/Property and include the 

same in the IIRUP. 

Despite the installation of FLOIS in 2013, 

said system is not yet fully utilized in 

POLO–Rome due to technical problems 

that remained unresolved, resulting in 

delayed reporting and updating of OFW 

records. Thus the objective of FLOIS was 

defeated. 

We recommended and the LabAtt agreed 

to send a formal letter to the ILAB 

informing of the issues/concerns on the 

implementation of FLOIS in POLO–

Rome 

Geneva, Switzerland 

The COs prepare records of collections 

and deposits, using CRReg and BRS which 

were not in accordance with the forms 

prescribed in Appendices 27 and 81 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume II, thus excess 

collections due to over deposit by some of 

their clients amounting to CHF1,030.07 for 

VF and CHF17.36 for MF and OEC were 

not accounted and recognized in the books. 

We recommended that the CO use the 

prescribed CDRReg form to record all 

cash collections and deposits; prepare the 

BRS in the prescribed form monthly; 

reconcile the bank balance of the CO’s 

CRReg, and reflect in the CRReg any 

excess deposits by OFWs. 

Not all accountable forms in the custody of 

the CO were included in the RAAF of the 

CO. There were 1,021 pieces of OECs of 

POEA counted during the cash 

examination which were not included in 

the RAAF. 

We recommended that the CO returns 

the old forms to the POEA for proper 

disposition/action. 

The Post regularly prepares its RPCPPE as 

required under exiting guidelines; 

however, the RPCPPE form was not fully 

accomplished as the location and condition 

of the items as well as other relevant 

information were not indicated in the 

remarks portion for easy validation of 

existence and condition of items. In 

addition, the RPCPPE was not reconciled 

with the DOLE HO’s PPE Schedule with 

some items not included in the RPCPPE or 

vice-versa. 

We recommended that the POLO, 

through the acting Property Officer to: 

 

 accomplish the RPCPPE form 
properly to reflect the result of 

physical count and the necessary 

information of all its property, such as 

the location/whereabouts and 

condition; 

 reconcile the RPCPPE with the 
DOLE–HO accounting records to: 

 account for the unserviceable PPE 



239 
 

Table 63: Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

in DOLE – HO accounting 

records; 

 verify the status and whereabouts 
of the PPE which were not 

included in the CY 2019 RPCPPE 

to establish accountability; and 

 include unserviceable properties in the 
IIRUP for subsequent request for 

authority from the DOLE-HO for their 

proper disposition. 

Reported accomplishment in three major 

outputs of the Post in CY 2018 showed 

significant increase vis-à-vis their targets 

for this year which manifest unrealistic 

target setting. The same condition exists in 

CY 2019 where targets have already 

exceeded as of June 30, 2019. In addition, 

there were noted discrepancies in the 

accomplishments reported to Congress and 

in the OPCR. 

We recommended that POLO–Geneva 

revisit its manner of target setting to 

come up with realistic targets that would 

match their corresponding success 

indicators to assess actual Post 

performance.  

We further recommended that due 

diligence be exercised in reporting 

accomplishments for a reliable 

information. 

Dubai, United Arab Emirates 

Delayed deposit of collections ranging 

from one to six days contrary to COA 

Memorandum No. 2013-004 dated July 9, 

2013, thus exposing the collections to risk 

of possible loss by theft or robbery. 

We recommended that the 

Administrative Officers deposit all 

collections daily and intact in accordance 

with Section 32, Chapter II of the 

Revised Manual on Cash Examination. 

ORs for the collection of OECs were not 

issued in numerical sequence, contrary to 

Section 4(h) of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I, and Chapter 2, Paragraph 24 of 

the Revised Cash Examination Manual, 

thus exposing the collections to risk of 

possible loss of income. 

We recommended that the 

Administrative Officers observe the 

issuance of ORs in numerical sequence as 

provided for under Section 4(h) of the 

GAM, Volume I, and Chapter 2, 

Paragraph 24 of the Revised Cash 

Examination Manual to facilitate 

accounting thereof. 

The reported accomplishments of the Post 

in the Report to Congress, relative to the 

implementation of RA No. 10022, on the 

five selected activities are unreliable as 

they do not match with the performance 

data in the Statistical Performance 

Reporting System (SPRS), which 

reportedly is the source/input report. 

We recommended that the Post reconcile 

the performance data in both reports and 

identify the reasons for the discrepancies 

to be able to correct them and pro-

actively prevent the repetition of the 

same discrepancies in the future reports 

and thus maintain their usefulness and 

credibility to the stakeholders who use 

these reports for decision-making and 

budget purposes. 

Madrid, Spain 

29 percent, or €5,141.80, of €17,490.78 

VF collections of the Post, as of November 

6, 2019, was not remitted, which is in 

violation of : (a) Section 64, 

Administrative Order  No. 168, Series of 

2013; (b) Section 44, Chapter 5, Budget 

Execution, Book VI, EO No. 292 dated 

We recommended that the DOLE–HO 

provide a policy guideline with regards to 

the collections by the Post, considering 

that the latter has no existing bank 

account in the host country.

July 25, 1987; (c) Section 4, GAA, FY 

2019 (RA No. 112600); and (d) Section 

65, PD No. 1445; thus depriving the 

government of the income accruing to it 

and of the use of the funds for intended 

purpose. 

 

 

The amount of €8.00 OEC collections for 

October 1 to 31, 2019 was not remitted as 

of cash count date on November 6, 2019 to 

forego the payment of service fee 

amounting to €5.00 per transaction, 

contrary to Section 64, AO No. 168, series 

of 2013. 

We recommended that the LabAtt 

strictly observe, at all times, the 

guidelines set forth by Section 64, 

Administrative Order No. 168, Series of 

2013, in the remittance of the collections. 

CDReg on MOOE showed a negative 

balance of Cash on Hand for CYs 2017 to 

2019 due to delay in the replenishment of 

Cash Advances from the DOLE–HO by 27 

to 29 days, thereby affecting the efficient 

implementation of PAPs intended for the 

OFWs. 

We recommended that the LabAtt make 

representation with DOLE-HO regarding 

the fund replenishment. 

Toronto, Canada 

10 units of ICT equipment intended for the 

implementation of the FLOIS remained 

unutilized as the FLOIS software system 

was not yet installed. 

We recommended that the Post: 

 

 follow-up with the DOLE-HO, the 
immediate installation of the FLOIS 

software so that the system can be 

implemented; and 

 for the DOLE – HO to consider in its 
future procurement, the number of 

prospective users and other existing 

computer facilities. 

Various unserviceable properties were not 

disposed of by the Post contrary to the 

provisions of Section 79 of PD No. 1445. 

We recommended that the Post request 

an authority from the HO for the 

disposal of unserviceable PPE items and 

upon approval, undertake the disposal 

thereof pursuant to the provisions of 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445.  

Included in the RAAF Without Money 

Value as of September 9, 2019 were 

POEA – OECs, issued by the POEA to the 

Post, which were no longer needed or 

usable at present because of the adoption 

of online application since 2016. 

We recommended that the LabAtt 

communicate to the POEA as to the 

appropriate action to be taken on the 

obsolete/non-usable OEC forms so that 

these forms can be deducted from her 

accountability. 

Washington DC, United States of America 

Collections of VFs and OECs were not 

deposited intact daily or on the next baking 

day in the local bank maintained by the 

POLO exposing the same to the risks of 

loss and unauthorized use of funds, 

contrary to Section 3.7.2 of DOLE-DFA-

DBM-DOF Joint Circular (JC) No. 3-99 

dated September 29, 1992. 

We recommended that the Deputized CO 

and the LabAtt comply with the 

provisions of Section 3.7.2 of DOLE-

DFA-DBM-DOF JC No. 3-99 dated 

September 29, 1992 and avoid the 

accumulation of undeposited collections 

which is not in accordance with the basic 

internal control of cash management.

Table 63: Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

The prescribed CDReg was not used by the 

Administrative Officers in recording the 

financial transactions. 

We recommended and the Post agreed 

that the concerned Administrative 

Officers use the forms prescribed in COA 

Circular Nos. 2003-006 and 2004-003 to 

simplify the recording of the financial 

transactions and to facilitate evaluation 

and review of operating transactions by 

the DOLE-HO.  

Collection Reports and the related 

attachments/supporting documents were 

not submitted to the DOLE-HO within five 

days of the succeeding month. 

We recommended that the Deputized CO 

and the LabAtt prepare on a timely basis, 

the reports and documents required to be 

included in the monthly CRReg for 

prompt submission to the DOLE-HO.  

Procedural lapses were observed in the 

administration and accounting/monitoring 

of property and equipment of the Post. 

We recommended that the AO through 

the local hire acting as the Property 

Officer: 

 

 assign individual property number 
and tag for components of computer 

hardware which were bundled or 

treated as one lot to have proper 

accounting and monitoring of each 

and every component; 

 assign property numbers/tags to all 
properties; 

 update the list of unserviceable 
property to include other items 

already fund unserviceable, and 

secure approval from the proper 

approving authority of the DOLE to 

dispose the property through proper 

mode of disposal taking into 

consideration the norm of doing so in 

the host country; and 

 update/correct the RPCPPE as at 
December 31, 2018 with the discussed 

audit exceptions already addressed, 

and submit it to the DOLE-HO 

reconciliation and preparation of the 

Department’s FSs. 

The FLOIS of the Post is not operating 

and/or could not be used resulting in the 

delay of the integration of the financial and 

operating reports of DOLE’s foreign 

operations which is not in accordance with 

Section 10 of Administrative Order No. 

168-13 dated April 30, 2013. 

We recommended and the LabAtt agreed 

to make representations with DOLE-HO 

for the complete installation of the 

FLOIS and to make it operational so that 

it could be used by the Post to ensure the 

complete recording of the financial and 

operational performance that will be 

appropriately captured in the electronic 

accounting system of the DOLE-HO.  

Kaohsiung, Taiwan 

Actual refunds to the DOLE – HO of the 

unutilized balances of cash advance in the

total amount of US$1,485.81 was recorded 

in the CDReg as ₱1,499.46, which is not 

accordance with Section 111 of PD No. 

1445. 

report the actual amount remitted to the 

DOLE-HO and recognize the bank 

charges as MOOE incurred in the Post. 

Unserviceable properties amounting to 

NTS180,658.00 or ₱261,118.85 were not 

reported in the IIRUP, as required under 

Section 40 (d.), Chapter 10, of the GAM 

for NGAs, Volume I and no action so far 

was initiated by the Post to dispose the 

same. 

We recommended that the concerned 

official of the Post initiate the necessary 

action/s towards the disposal of the 

identified unserviceable items of PPE in 

the total amount of NT$180,658.00 or 

₱261,118.85 the soonest possible time in 

order to save on time and effort in the 

safekeeping thereof as well as to free the 

storage space that are being presently 

occupied to store new acquisitions and 

other serviceable items. 

Taichung, Taiwan 

All collections for VF were remitted daily 

by the Manila Economic and Cultural 

Office (MECO)-Taichung to the Post, for 

which a single DOLE receipt was issued 

by the Post in the name of MECO to 

acknowledge the remittance, consistent 

with the DOLE-MECO MOA dated May 

26, 2016. 

We commended the Post for its sound 

management and accurate recording of 

VF collections. 

The requirement to remit the excess VF to 

the National Treasury within five working 

days after the end of the calendar year, 

under DOLE-DFA-DBM-DOF-COA Joint 

Circular No. 3-00 dated September 1, 1999 

has not been fully complied. Further, there 

are no policy guidelines in 

determining/computing the excess VF to 

be remitted to the National Treasury. 

We recommended and the Post agreed 

to: 

 

 coordinate with the DOLE-HO to fully 
comply with the requirement of JC No. 

3-99 and DOLE AO 190-12 s. of 2012 to 

remit the excess VF Fund balance 

within five days after the end of the 

year; and 

 bring to the attention of the DOLE-HO 
the need to define the excess VF to be 

remitted to the National Treasury, with 

due consideration of the fund sourcing 

of expenses that may be legally charged 

against VF for the ensuing year, subject 

to a budget approved for the purpose. 

Cash advances totaling NT$8,871,689.25 

were duly accounted for with established 

balance of accountability as of October 14, 

2019 of NT$479,130.00, all which were 

presented in a cash  and cash item during 

cash count, the possession thereof for a 

longer period, even if placed in the vault, 

exposes the fund to the risk of loss. 

We recommended and the Post agreed 

to: 

 

 avoid large amount of cash on 
hand/retention; 

 deposit all authorized MOOE 
withdrawals from VF fund to the 

common MOOE bank account and 

withdraw cash only as the due dates 

for payments/need to disburse arises; 

and 

 if warranted, established PCF for

petty expenses. 

Semi-expendable properties were 

presented in the RPCPPE of the Post 

which Report does not reconcile with 

RPCPPE of the DOLE-HO contrary to 

pertinent provisions of Chapter 8 and 10, 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

We recommended and the Post agreed 

to: 

 

 maintain a record or control 
containing the DOLE-HO assigned 

property number and that of the Post 

assigned property number. It is 

further recommended that the Post 

coordinate with the DOLE-HO to 

have a uniform assignment of 

property numbers for properties 

recently acquired; 

 prepare and submit Waste Material 
Report to DOLE-HO and request that 

the properties that were reflected in 

the RCPPE which were already 

disposed shall be dropped from the 

books/records; and 

 investigate further and establish the 
whereabouts of the properties that 

were not found on station and 

reconcile its records with the records 

of DOLE-HO. 

The Post, composed of five-man team 

POLO, as supported by a three-man team 

OWWA, has consistently reported 

remarkable performance in its major 

programs, and has succeeded in making 

the government’s presence felt by the 

OFWs in Central Taiwan. 

While we strongly commended the Post 

for an impressive and remarkable 

performance, we recommended that the 

Post endeavors to seek balance of work 

and rest/recreation of its personnel by, 

among others, prioritizing the 

performance tasks that are related to its 

mandate, rationalizing its schedule of 

activities to give a break to its 

hardworking personnel, and requesting 

for additional manpower complement, 

subject to availability of funds. 

The function no. 5 of POLO referred to in 

the previous year’s audit report was 

substantially satisfied with the partnership 

of the Post and the Ugnayan Migrant 

Center and as beefed up by other activities 

conducted by the Post. 

We commended the joint efforts of the 

Post and the Ugnayan Migrant Center in 

providing assistance and protecting and 

promoting the welfare of distressed 

OFWs and recommended for the 

continued mutual support and 

partnership in protecting the welfare of 

distressed migrants and other overseas 

Filipinos, subject to periodic evaluation 

of its necessity and effectiveness as the 

parties may mutually agree and the 

discretion of the Secretary of Labor. 

We further recommended that the Post 

should find ways to make its presence at 

the shelter more visible and evident and 

strengthen its ties with the shelter to 



244 
 

Table 63: Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

arrest or forestall any adverse effect 

should the going concern/survival risk 

described above happen. 

The utility of the FLOIS has not been 

maximized due to the absence of duly 

designated personnel who shall fully man, 

update and maintain it, thus defeating the 

purpose of its existence. The POEA and 

OWWA database systems for OEC and 

welfare concerns have not yet been 

interfaced or integrated with the FLOIS. 

We recommended that the Post maximize 

the utilization of FLOIS by either 

assessing the capacity and re-distribution 

of work of existing personnel or hiring 

full-time FLOIS Operator, subject to the 

availability of funds, and make 

representation with concerned 

authorities for possible upgrading and 

interfacing of the POEA and OWWA 

database systems with the FLOIS. 

The Post could have earned service fees 

that could be used to subsidize the 

expenses incurred for the collection 

services it rendered in behalf of POEA. 

We recommended that the LabAtt shall 

bring to the attention of the DOLE-HO 

the matter of imposition of service fees to 

defray or at least subsidize the expenses 

incurred by the Post in connection with 

the collection service it rendered for the 

POEA. 

Reports with identical contents were 

prepared and submitted by the Post to 

DOLE-HO, thus duplicating efforts and 

resources spent to prepare them. Further, 

the CRR generated by the FLOIS have no 

entries for daily deposits. 

We commended the Post for its timely 

submission of monthly reports and 

recommended that it submits/utilizes the 

CRReg and CBReg as prescribed by the 

GAM for NGAs and bring the matter to 

the HO to customize the Report of 

Collections and FLOIS generated CRReg 

with the format and data similar to the 

ones prescribed by the GAM for NGAs to 

address the duplication of reports.

implementation of GAD in CY 2020: 

 

Table 66: Summary of Observations in the implementation of GAD per RO 

Office Observation 
Actual Cost 

(In PhP) 

CO Delayed submission of the PCW-endorsed GPB as well as GAR, hence, the Audit 

Team was not able to promptly and properly assess/audit the propriety of the 

expenses incurred and whether the GAD programs, activities and projects 

indicated therein correspond to the Agency’s mandate. 

 

Further, inquiry revealed that although the agency failed to endorse the GPB to 

the PCW, it was acknowledged when they submitted the GAD Accomplishment 

Report. They also informed us that they are reformulating the GPB so that they 

may be able to provide a PCW-endorsed GPB in the next FY. 

Not Available 

III RO III failed to implement and adopt the relevance and impact of the use of sex-

disaggregated data in the assessment, examination of the completeness, 

accounting of the distribution and documentation, accuracy of reports, and 

existence and legitimacy of grantees for DOLE-CAMP required by RA 9710.  

However, DOLE’s other programs such as, SPES, GIP, TUPAD Workers and 

DILP, have already incorporated such information that is required by RA 9710. 

13,615,000.00 

 IV-B Despite the compliance of RO IVB with the foregoing laws, rules and regulations 

on GAD planning, budgeting, implementation of PPAs, the GAD Focal Person 

failed to submit the GPB as well as the Accomplishment Report to the Office of 

the Auditor within the period. 

Interview with the GAD Focal Person revealed that they were not able to submit 

the GBP and Accomplishment Report since they haven’t received yet the 

approved copy of said GAD reports from the DOLE-CO. 

 

Nevertheless, the non-submission of the pertinent GAD reports to the Audit Team 

within the reglementary period precluded the prompt evaluation and verification 

of its accomplishments relative to its GPB, early detection and correction of 

errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of audit results to the management. 

37,907,372.25 

 V For CY 2020, the DOLE RO V supposed Budget for GAD should be 

₱72,939,435.93 or 5 per cent of the total ₱1,458,788,718.56 subsidy from the

X For CY 2020, DOLE X programs and activities were geared towards addressing

(PWDs) pursuant to Section 31 of the General Provisions of GAA FY 2020, 

Batas Pambansang Blg. 344 and RA 7277.  However, due to this COVID-19 

pandemic, all GAD related activities were cancelled. 

 

The audit further noted that some areas of concern were still minimally 

undertaken in the implementation of some DOLE Livelihood and related 

programs. 

Not Available 

XI Non-conduct of gender analysis to support the identified gender issues to be 

addressed by the Agency’s GAD activities and budget stated in the RO XI’s GPB 

worth ₱10,832,500.00 per GAR, was due to reliance of the RO on the GPB to be 

cascaded from the DOLE-CO. 

 

The Audit Team requested, via electronic mail, to submit the approved GPB 

together with the results of gender analyses that led to the identification of gender 

issues in RO XI, its corresponding GAD activities/programs/budget and whether 

the implementation of its programs addressed the gender issues. However, only 

the GPB and GAR, along with a list of disbursements supposedly pertaining to 

GAD PAPs,were submitted. 

 

In a personal follow-up with the GAD Focal Person, she said that the RO does not 

conduct anymore gender analysis since the CO does not seem to be considering 

the RO GPB. 

 

Rather, the Agency, as a whole, has adopted a practice of preparing a template 

GPB, with the Gender issues and PAPs already identified, while the RO will just 

fill in details in the activities applicable to them. Consequently, their proposed 

interventions in the past were not considered. 

13,439,923.00 



254 
 

Table 66: Summary of Observations in the implementation of GAD per RO 

Office Observation 
Actual Cost 

(In PhP) 

 

The RO finds it unnecessary to conduct gender analysis anymore since the CO 

would eventually require them to adopt a pre-determined set of GAD issues and 

PAPs, rendering GAD planning in the regional level useless already. 

 

Furthermore, no PCW-endorsed GPB was disseminated by the CO to the RO 

which should have guided the RO in the implementation of GAD PAPs.  The 

same is also necessary in the preparation of the GAD Accomplishment Report to 

accurately report the approved GAD budget and activities. 

 

Meanwhile, several GAD PAPs were discontinued, indicating in the GAR that the 

Agency’s focus of concern is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

XIII The Audit Team previously issued an Audit Observation Memorandum on non-

preparation of GAD data base and the Sex Disaggregated Data. This observation 

remained partially implemented in CY 2020.

Office Management’s Comment and  Auditor’s Rejoinder 

CO The Management commits to comply within the COA prescribed 

period for the submission of the succeeding GAD reports. 

NCR Management commented that they will continue to implement GAD 

in the mandated programs/projects/activities of the RO. 

IV-B The Management sent a letter request to DOLE CO to formalize 

their request for a copy of the Approved GAD Accomplishment 

Reports and GPB for the CY 2020. 

XI Management informed that they will conduct gender analyses during 

their Annual GAD Planning and Budgeting and year-end evaluation 

of GAD implementation. The results of the gender analyses will be 

raised to the CO to address the GAD concerns in the Region and will 

also be used as bases for the procurements of the Agency. 

 

Management also committed that quarterly meetings will be 

conducted to review and revisit programs to be conducted every year 

and that the DOLE XI will continually provide GAD programs to 

address gender-related issues in the office especially during the 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

The RO will also coordinate with the CO regarding the PCW-

endorsed/approved GPB.

Office Management’s Comment and  Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team appreciates the Management’s commitment to take 

the necessary actions to implement the above recommendations.  

Regular monitoring shall be conducted by the Team on the 

implementation of the recommendations. 

  
 

Compliance with Senior Citizen (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

17. The CO and eight ROs had complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions of 
RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 in the implementation of plans, programs, 

and projects related to SCs and PWDs. 

 

17.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as 
the GAA for FY 2020, provides that all agencies of the government shall 

formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of 

senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their 

mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs, or facilities that will reasonably 

enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant 

to Batas Pambansa Bldg. 344 or RA No. 7277, as amended. 

 

17.2 RA No. 7277 of the Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities mandates the 
rehabilitation, self- development and self-reliance of disabled persons and 

their integration into the mainstream of society and for other purposes. It 

further defines the rights and privileges of disabled persons such as equal 

opportunity for employment, access to quality education, national health 

program, auxiliary social services, telecommunications, accessibility 

(barrier-free environment), political and civil rights.  

17.3 For CY 2020, activities undertaken for the implementation of plans, 
programs and projects related to SCs and PWD intended to address their 

concerns are as follows:  

 
Table 67: Summary of Observations per RO

₱1,451,675.27 were not remitted, in violation of Sections 6 and 7 of RA No. 

8291 or the GSIS Act of 1997. 

 

19.1 Agency Remittance of premium contributions and other amounts due to the

provides that “remittances pertaining to Premium Contributions are 

mandatorily required to be collected and remitted by the agencies to the 

GSIS consisting of Personal Share, Government Share and Employees 

Compensation.” 

 



267 
 

19.2 Furthermore, Sections 6 and 7 of RA No. 8291 or The GSIS Act of 1997, 
An Act Amending PD No. 1146, as amended, Expanding and Increasing the  

Coverage and Benefits of the GSIS, Instituting Reforms therein and for 

Other Purposes requires that: 

 

Sec. 6. Collection and Remittance of Contributions  - a) The 

employer shall report to the GSIS the names of all its employees, 

their corresponding employment status, positions, salaries and such 

other pertinent information, including subsequent changes therein, 

if any, as may be required by the GSIS; the employer shall deduct 

each month from the monthly salary or compensation of each 

employee the contribution payable by him in accordance with the 

schedule prescribed in the rules and regulations implementing this 

Act. 

 

b) Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employee’s 

and employer’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of the 

calendar month following the month to which the contributions 

apply. The remittance by the employer of the contribution to the 

GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all 

obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees. 

 

Sec. 7. Interest on Delayed Remittances. - Agencies which delay 

the remittance of any and all monies due the GSIS shall be charged 

interests as may be prescribed by the Board but not less than two 

percent (2%) simple interest per month. Such interest shall be paid 

by the employers concerned. 

 

19.3 Verification of the account showed a total unremitted balance of 
₱1,451,675.27 as of December 31, 2020, of which a big portion came from 

the DOLE CO and RO IV-B amounting to ₱624,564.74 and ₱453,743.46, 

respectively. This balance appeared in the records of the accountable officer 

in charge of remittances and deductions per comparison of the monthly 

contributions/loans repayments/reductions vis-à-vis remittances/refunds to 

the members, contrary to Sections 6 and 7 of RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act 

of 1997, an act amending PD No. 1146, as amended, thus the affected 

employees may be deprived of loan privileges and may not avail full 

benefits upon retirement from government service. Summary is presented as
