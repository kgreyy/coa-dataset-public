EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Department of Labor was established by virtue of Act No.  4121 enacted on 

December 8, 1933.  It became a Ministry in 1978 and was reorganized and expanded into 

the Ministry of Labor and Employment in 1980.   In 1986, it was renamed as the Department 

of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to suit the presidential form of government re-

established after the EDSA Revolution in 1986. 

 

The DOLE is mandated to formulate policies, implement programs and services, 

and serve as the policy-coordinating arm of the Executive Branch in the field of labor and 

employment.  It is also mandated to promote gainful employment opportunities, develop 

human resources, protect workers and promote their welfare and maintain industrial peace.  

Consistent with the national development plan, its vision is the attainment of decent and 

productive employment for every Filipino worker. 

 

To ensure inclusive development, prosperity, and labor justice, the Labor Secretary 

came up with an Eight-Point Labor and Employment Agenda as a contribution of the 

Department to help achieve President Rodrigo R. Duterte’s overall vision for our workers 

and their families, as well as for employers, as follows: 

 

 To continuously enhance and transform DOLE into an efficient, responsive, 
purposeful, and accountable institution; 

 To address the persistent problems of unemployment and underemployment; 

 To continuously strengthen protection and security of Overseas Filipino 
Workers (OFWs); 

 To ensure full respect of labor standards and the fundamental principles and 
rights at work; 

 To bring more focus and accessibility to workers’ protection and welfare 
programs; 

 To achieve a sound, dynamic, and stable industrial peace with free and 
democratic participation of workers and employers in policy and decision-

making processes affecting them; 

 To have a labor dispute resolution system that ensures just, simplified, and 
expeditious resolution of all labor disputes; and 

 To have responsive, enabling, and equitable labor policies, laws, and regulations. 
 

The Department has 16 Regional Offices (ROs) with 83 Field Offices (FOs) and 

four Satellite Offices, 37 Philippine Overseas Labor Offices (POLOs), six Bureaus, and 

seven Support or Staff Services.  There are also 10 Agencies attached to it for policy and 

program supervision and/or coordination, namely: Employees' Compensation Commission 

(ECC), Institute for Labor Studies (ILS), National Conciliation and Mediation Board 

(NCMB), National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), National Maritime Polytechnic 

(NMP), National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC), Occupational Safety and

The FY 2020 JobStart Philippines Program implementation was deferred due to 

restrictions under community quarantine. The Memorandum on deferment of the program 

was signed by Secretary Bello and disseminated to ROs on May 29, 2020. While program 

implementation was deferred, DOLE-BLE is enhancing the Manual of Operations and 

developing online materials to prepare for JobStart resumption in the new normal as 

follows: 

 

 Online module on LST and incorporation of Chatbot support in its delivery, 
with the help of ADB and Plan International 

 Incorporate online training on Work Ethics for a Productive Workforce (in 
partnership with NWPC) 

The deferment of the livelihood projects was due to limitations/ restrictions in local 

travels that limited the conduct of monitoring of livelihood projects at the regional level.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of DOLE and its 

ROs for CY 2020, except RO No. XII, for which the Audit Team has not yet 

transmitted the respective Management Letter.  The audit was conducted to:             

a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on 

the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the 

extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; and c) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation 

of the financial statements of DOLE for CY  2020 considering that the  misstatement 

of ₱46,322,646.30 due to errors and omissions in  accounts Cash and Cash 

Equivalents, Receivables, Property, Plant and Equipment and Liabilities is below the 

materiality threshold of ₱79,771,250.95 or two percent of the total current operating 

expenses of ₱3,988,562,547.26, as  stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and 

discussed in detail in Part II of this Report. 

 

F. Significant Audit  Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed 

in Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. The DOLE’s consolidated financial statements (FSs) were misstated by 
₱46,322,646.30, which is below the materiality threshold of ₱79,771,250.95 or 



viii 
 

 

two percent of the total current operating expenses of ₱3,988,562,547.26 for an 

expense-driven entity. (Observation No. 1) 

 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Accountants of 

the concerned Offices to recognize all reconciling items in the BRSs that 

require adjustment/correction in the books of accounts and revert back to 

Cash accounts all unreleased and stale checks.  

 

RECEIVABLES  

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a) require the Chief Accountant and Property Officer of the CO to effect 
the adjustments of unrecorded deliveries; and 

 

b) direct the Accountant of RO IX to prepare the necessary adjusting 
journal entries to recognize Other Receivables and disclose in the Notes 

to FSs the unclaimed and unrefunded financial assistance that are still in 

custody of the MRC. 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

and the Property Officer of the concerned Offices to reconcile and effect the 

necessary corrections in the books and RPCPPE for the unrecorded, 

unserviceable, disposed, transferred, lost and damage, and misclassified PPE 

items, as well as the misstatements in the affected accounts duly supported 

with proper documentation. 

 

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to require the concerned 

Accountants of: 

 

a) NCR and RO XI to revert the Accounts Payable totaling ₱26,883,800.43 
that have been outstanding for more than two years to the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund in compliance with relevant 

provisions of laws; and

OTHER PAYABLES 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to make the necessary reconciliation and adjustments in the 

books to eliminate the erroneous classification of Other Payables totaling 

₱13,339,973.08. 

 

2. Other accounting deficiencies totaling ₱754,358,304.82 were observed in the 
recording and reporting of financial transactions due to insufficient reconciliation 

of Accounting/Property records, non-preparation of the required records/reports, 

unsupported/ long outstanding balances,  inadequate monitoring of 

project/activities completion, and inadequate disclosure in the Notes to FSs; thus, 

affecting the reliability, accuracy, completeness and existence of the reported 

account balances of the Assets and Liabilities and other related accounts in the 

FSs of the Department as of December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 2) 

 

CASH IN BANK ACCOUNTS

3. Insufficient internal control measures in the grant of financial assistance thru  
COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP); TUPAD #BKBK; and Abot-

Kamay ang Pagtulong (AKAP) sa OFWs (AKAP for OFWs) resulted in: a) 

excessive/multiple payments totaling ₱1,023,750.00; b) denied claims and/or less 

than the amount stated in the DOLE DOs; c) unclaimed amounts in the possession 

of Money Remittance Centers (MRCs) totaling ₱22,432,840.00; and d) 

incomplete and deficient documents on the payment of financial assistance 

contrary to the pertinent DOLE DOs/AOs relative to the implementation of 

Bayanihan I or RA No. 11469, thereby casting doubt on the propriety and/or 

validity of the financial assistance granted to the beneficiaries of the said 

programs. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a) require the concerned Offices to conduct further investigation on the 
noted excessive payments and institute necessary actions;  

 

b) design additional control measures to avoid double payments of financial 
assistance in the succeeding implementation of the Bayanihan-2 

Programs. 

 

c) require POLOs, NCR and RO IV-A to conduct further investigation on 
the beneficiaries who denied receipt and received less than the approved 

amount of the financial assistance;  

 

d) require NCR to: 
 

 validate if the concerned Security Agency 
 

 claimed the CAMP assistance for their employees; 
 made payroll deductions to the concerned employee for the 

financial assistance received from DOLE; and

₱2,861,113,898.92 allotments for the three regular programs, namely: TUPAD, DILP, 

and GIP, thereby leaving an unutilized amount of ₱177,362,740.43 or 6.20 percent 

with 139.47 percent accomplishment over the target beneficiaries for CY 2020, thus, 

achieving DOLE’s contribution to the government’s agenda of inclusive growth thru

a) RO IX direct the Field Office Focal Persons to: 
 

 coordinate with the respective ACPs and require compliance with the

5. The balances of the trust receipts and collections of registration fees of ROs V and 
XIII totaling ₱18,694,840.72 were unremitted to the BTr, contrary to Sections 6 

and 10 of the General Provisions of GAA, Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 or Republic Act 

(RA) No. 11465 and EO No. 338, s. 1996; thus, depriving the national 

government of the proper disposition of these funds. (Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to require ROs V and XIII to 

remit the amount to the BTr. in pursuance of the abovementioned law and 

regulations.  

 

6. Insufficient observance of the laws, rules, regulations in the granting, utilization, 
and liquidation of CAs under COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 6 of COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 resulted in unliquidated CAs totaling ₱1,572,152,901.75 

even if their purpose had already been served; thus, exposing public funds to 

possible risk of misuse and non-recording of related expenses within the period 

these were incurred. (Observation No. 7) 

 

 

 



xv 
 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a) require the concerned Accountants to send demand letters to AOs, with 
outstanding balances as well as to the resigned/retired AOs to strictly 

enforce the submission of liquidation documents as soon as the purpose 

for which the CA was granted has been served and refund simultaneously 

any excess amount thereof, otherwise, cause the withholding of salaries 

pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, and 

update records to facilitate proper monitoring; 

 

b) stop the practice of granting additional CAs to AOs with outstanding 
unliquidated CAs;

Director for special purposes;  

 

AO/ILAB Dir. to:

to the authority to handle CA was given; otherwise, the said expenses will 

be disallowed in audit; and 

 

f) regularly monitor the liquidation/settlement of outstanding advances for 
those AOs who are currently assigned to POLOs. 

 

7. Fund transfers to NGAs, NGOs/CSOs, LGUs and GOCCs for the regular 
operations totaling ₱1,106,350,662.13 remained unliquidated for more than one 

year to less than 10 years due to the deficient monitoring of program/project 

completion and liquidation by the Implementing Agencies (IAs) contrary to COA 

Circular Nos. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, and 2007-001 dated October 25, 

2007.  

 

While, fund transfers to LGUs for the implementation of  Coronavirus Disease 

2019 (COVID-19) program under the Tulong Panghanapbuhay Para sa Ating 

Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers #Barangay Ko, Bahay Ko! (TUPAD#BKBK) 

amounting to ₱50,836,476.00 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, 

which raised doubts in ascertaining whether the allocation for the program was 

used for its intended purpose. (Observation No. 8) 

 

 

 

 



xvi 
 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

On regular operations: 

 

a) ensure compliance with the requirements prescribed under DOLE DO Nos. 
36-02, s. 2002 and 173, s. 2017 and COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 

on the implementation, monitoring and liquidation of funds released to 

LGUs, NGAs, NGOs/CSOs and GOCCs;  

 

b) direct the Program Officers concerned to cause the immediate submission of 
terminal/liquidation reports within the prescribed periods by the ACPs and 

to closely monitor the implementation of projects to ensure that the objective 

of the projects is attained, and that any deviations are addressed 

immediately; 

 

c) instruct the Technical Support and Services Division Chief to compel the 
concerned LGUs to: i) return the unused balance of the fund of the completed 

projects to settle the funds transferred, particularly those with long 

outstanding accounts; and ii) consider instituting  appropriate sanctions on 

defaulting LGUs for non-liquidation of fund transfers (RO IVB); 

 

d) continuously exert extra effort to send demand letters to NGAs, LGUs, 
NGOs/CSOs and GOCCs with outstanding balances for the immediate 

settlement/liquidation of their accounts and copy furnish the same to COA; 

 

On fund transfers for the implementation of TUPAD #BKBK: 

 

e) demand for the immediate liquidation by the respective LGUs/ACPs of the 
fund transferred ; and 

 

f) immediately refund any unutilized portion of the funds. 
 

8. Dormant balances of asset and liability accounts totaling ₱167,802,088.61 remained in 
the books due to insufficient actions by Management on account balances, contrary to 

COA Circular Nos. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 and 97-001 dated February 5, 

1997, thus balances of both accounts could no longer be ascertained, and collections of 

receivables ceased to be probable. (Observation No. 9) 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to:  

 

On dormant asset accounts 

 

a) consider the filing of a request to write-off the dormant accounts following the 
step-by-step procedure duly supported with documents as required under 

COA Circular No. 2016-005, if warranted (CO, BWSC-SAP/SAWP, RO I, 

IV-B, VI, IX and XIII); 



xvii 
 

 

b) send demand letters to all those with unliquidated accounts for the settlement 
of the funds transferred to NGAs, NGOs/CSOs and LGUs (RO IV-A); 

 

c) direct the Legal Service to file appropriate collection suit against the 
defaulting AOs, if feasible (CO); and determine if legal action shall be 

instituted on any of the circumstances, such as failure of the LGU to complete 

the project and material violations of the MOA or COA Circular No. 2007-

001 dated October 25, 2007 in compliance with Item No. K under 4.5.3 of the 

said Circular (BWSC-SAP/SAWP);

Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 (XIII); and  

 

f) analyze the dormant Due to BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and Philhealth accounts 
and make appropriate action thereof (CO). 

 

9. The insufficient reporting, monitoring, validation, and coordination with the 
concerned stakeholders by the BWSC on the shares, distribution and balances of 

the CBF resulted in the accumulation of  undistributed CBF of 

which ₱161,331,914.80 is deemed forfeited in favor of the socioeconomic 

programs for sugar workers according to Section 9 of RA No. 6982 dated May 1, 

1991, thus, affecting the full attainment of the program’s objective of augmenting 

the sugar workers income to enjoy decent living for themselves and their families 

and the reliability of the status report of the  CBF as of December 31, 2020. 

(Observation No. 10) 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a) coordinate with the ROs on the monitoring of the compliance by the 
concerned Mills/PAs/Coops/PMs on the distribution of the CBF, 

validation of the undistributed CBF and forfeited amount, and intensify 

the distribution and remittance thereof; otherwise institute appropriate 

actions on the defaulting Mills/PAs/Coops/PMs; 

 

b) require the Accounting Divisions of both the ROs and the BWSC-CO to 
have a detailed and updated CBF status report per RO for control and 



xviii 
 

 

monitoring purposes and submit the same to the Audit Team, for 

verification; and 

 

c) coordinate with the STC to include in their regular meetings the issues 
raised and to come up with a resolution that will monitor and prevent the 

accumulation of unreleased/undistributed CBF. 

 

10. Non-compliance with COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 or 
Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, 

Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures resulted 

in irregular/unnecessary/excessive expenditures totaling ₱7,735,157.31. 

(Observation No. 11) 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a) require NCR to grant reimbursable RATA instead of fixed RATA;

executed by the official concerned that the expenses sought to be 

reimbursed have been incurred for any of the purposes allowed by law 

pursuant to COA Circular No. 89-300 and Section 42 of the GAA of FY 

2020;
