C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial audit of the accounts and operations of the BIR for 

the period ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the 

level of assurance that maybe placed on Management’s assertions on the financial 

statements (FSs); (b) determine propriety of transactions, as well as extent of 

compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunities; and, (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior 

years’ audit recommendations.  

 

Verification on the correctness/accuracy of the revenues/taxes collected during the 

year totaling P1,956.441 billion, was not undertaken due to the absence of approved 

guidelines in the audit of tax assessment as required under Executive Order (EO) No. 

38 dated October 30, 1998.  However, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), in its letter 

dated June 4, 2021 to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, informed that the 

amount of P1,956.284 billion representing gross revenue collections were recorded 

in the BTr’s books of accounts. The difference of P0.157 billion pertains to the 

accrued income recorded by the BIR.   

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in  the audit of the financial statements of 

the BIR and in the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations. The Audit 

Team which carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and 

accounting procedures adopted by the BIR and other relevant documentation; (ii) 

assessed internal controls regulating financial operations and carried out compliance 

testing for determining the extent of control in operation; (iii) conducted substantive 



 iii 

testing of a representative sample of selected transactions; (iv) carried out review, 

on test check basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements 

in balances of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted 

interviews and held discussions with the concerned officials and staff in the NO and 

RRs.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda and 

Summary of Observations and Recommendations (SAOR). 

 
 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FSs of the 

BIR for CY 2020 due to the material accounting errors and omissions noted in the 

audit affecting the balances of accounts Due from Officers and Employees; Other 

Receivables; Inventories; Semi-expendable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPEs); 

PPEs; Forfeited Property/Assets; Inter-Agency Payables; and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) as stated in Part I - Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in 

detail under Part II – Observations and Recommendations of this report. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Accounting errors/omissions in the recording of transactions of the BIR resulted 
in the misstatement of affected accounts 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chiefs of 

Revenue Accounting Division (RAD), Disbursements Accounting Division 

(DAD) and Regional Finance Divisions (RFD) to effect the necessary 

adjustments on the errors/omissions. 
 

2. Various accounting deficiencies in recording and reporting financial 
transactions amounting to P278.143 million undermine the qualitative 

characteristics of information in the FSs. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chiefs of RAD, 

DAD and RFD to correct the accounting deficiencies noted, in accordance 

with the relevant provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 

for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and other existing accounting 

rules and regulations. 
 

3. Deficiencies and non-compliance with prescribed cash management 
mechanisms and controls related to cash-on-hand, cash items, collections, 



 iv 

remittances, reporting, and safeguarding in several RRs exposed collections and 

funds to risk and resulted in losses. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) Regional Director in RR4 to require the Revenue Collecting Officer 
(RCO) to (i) immediately deposit the outstanding unremitted 

collections worth P364,559.68; (ii) consider filing appropriate charges 

against the erring Accountable Officer; and (iii) enforce stricter 

monitoring controls to prevent similar violations; 

 

b) RCOs in RRs 8B, 9A, 9B 15 and 19 to deposit intact all collections daily 
or not later than the next banking day; and (ii) respective Chiefs of 

Revenue Collection Section to monitor compliance therewith;  

 

c) Regional Cashier of RR 8B to submit the Statement of Report of 
Collections and Deposits promptly to the RFD so that collections will 

be timely recognized in the books;  

 

d) Require the RCOs of Revenue District Office (RDO) 94 Basilan to 
include in their Report of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) the daily 

collections and deposits from sale of Documentary Stamp Taxes; and 

 

e) All concerned RCOs of RR 19 to (i) explain in writing the reason/s for 
the delayed remittance of the daily total collections with supporting 

documents; and (ii) issue the pre-numbered Official Receipts in strict 

numerical sequence so that cash accountability and balances of unused 

accountable forms could be easily determined. 

 

4. The BIR’s inability to completely and properly accomplish and maintain the 
Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs caused 

limitations in: (a) timely enforcement of the collection of receivables from 

debtors and recovery of accountabilities; (b) confirming validity of obligations 

of the debtors/accountable officers; and (c) monitoring and management of 

outstanding balances, resulting in the impairment and misstatement of the 

accounts and, eventually, loss of government resources. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, RAD to: 

 

a) Correct and update the SL information in egos in compliance with 
Appendix 06, Volume II of GAM for NGAs, and henceforth comply 

with the requirements therewith; 

 

b) Issue Demand Letters for the settlement of outstanding balances to the 
debtors and accountable officers on the remaining 3,622 SL balances in 

the Due from Officers and Employees, and Other Receivables accounts; 

and 



 v 

c) Submit proof or copies of duly received/served Demand Letters for the 
21 SLs on bank penalties totaling P0.843 million, and those which will 

be issued for the 3,622 remaining SLs. 
 

5. Direct Contracting with Phil Repro-Com Products and Systems Inc. was 
resorted to as the mode of procurement of consumable toners/drums totaling 

P1.474 million, when there are other authorized distributors/channels in the 

local market, thus, depriving RR 1 in getting better offers from other potential 
distributors/partners or who could offer the same items/specifications at a much 

lower price. 

 

We recommended that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) strictly 

determine the existence of the requirements or conditions in Direct 

Contracting as stated in Section 50 of the Implementing Rules and 

Regulations and the Manual of Procedures before using this mode of 

procurement. We also recommended that the BAC Secretariat post the 

notice of direct contracting and request for quotation in the PhilGEPS 

website as required in the manual.  

 

6. The non-imposition by the RR 5 of the appropriate sanction to RC Ramos 
Construction Corporation for the construction of its Regional Office and RDOs 

25A and 25B buildings including site/land development works in the amount of 

P219.441 million due to the slippage incurred in excess of the 10 per cent 

allowed had been disadvantageous to the Agency. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to explain their inaction on the 

default of the Contractor in the completion of the project that could have 

protected the interest of the government. 

 

7. RRs 7A and 7B had paid a total of P0.665 million and obligated a total of 
P115,500.00 in excess of the authorized hazard pay, while RR 6 had paid a total 

of P322,500.00 sans the Approved Skeleton Workforce (SWF) Schedule and 

Daily Time Records (DTRs), which is not in accordance with DBM Budget 

Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020.  

 

We recommended and Management of RR 6 agreed to: (a) submit the 

approved SWF; and (b) require the refund of the amount of P322,500.00 

which were paid despite the absence of DTRs; 
 

We also recommended and Management of RR 7A and 7B agreed to 

require the concerned personnel to refund the overpayment of hazard pay 

totaling P0.604 million within ten days from receipt of the AOM and 

immediately revert the excess amount of P115,500.00 recorded as Due to 

Officers and Employees. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

discussed with Management during the exit conference on June 3, 2021. 



 vi 

Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

For CY 2020, Notices of Suspension (NSs) and Disallowance (NDs) issued by the 

Audit Teams amounted to P5.741 million and P318.572 million, respectively, while 

there were no Notices of Charge issued. Notice of Settlement of Suspension/ 

Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) issued during the year for settlement of NSs and 

NDs amounted to P10.945 million. The details of the audit suspensions, 

disallowances, and charges as at December 31, 2020, are shown in Part II of this 

report. 

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations  

 

Of the 112 prior years’ audit recommendations, 35 were implemented and 77 were 

not implemented, the details of which are discussed in Part III of this report.  

 

We enjoin Management to ensure implementation of all audit recommendations 

to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the BIR.
