OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors/Omissions   

 

1. Accounting errors/omissions in the recording of transactions of the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) resulted in the misstatement of affected accounts. 

 

The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides 

that financial statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

presentation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance 

with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 

expenses set out in the IPSASs.  

 

In the preparation of FSs, the highest standards of honesty, objectivity, and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccurate or misleading information.1 Each government agency shall record its 

financial transactions and operations conformably with the generally accepted 

accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations.2   

 

Examination and verification of the general ledgers (GLs), subsidiary ledgers 

(SLs), journal entry vouchers (JEVs), Reports of Collections and Deposits, Report of 

Dishonored and Redeemed Checks, Consolidated Inventory of Seized and Forfeited 

Assets (CISFA)3, and other documents in the National Office (NO) and revenue 

regions (RRs) disclosed errors and omissions that resulted in misstatements of 

affected accounts, as shown in Table 1.

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chiefs of RAD, 

DAD and RFD to correct the accounting deficiencies noted, in accordance with 

the relevant provisions of the GAM for NGAs and other existing accounting rules 

and regulations. 

 

a. Unresolved/ unreconciled carryover balances 
 

This observation has been consistently included as finding in the previous 

years’ audit reports of RR 9B.  The amount represents the beginning balance which 

was set-up during the initial implementation of e-NGAS in CY 2005, in the absence 

of SL details of the account Cash, Collecting Officers. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to request for authority to 

write-off the accounts in accordance with the guidelines and procedures in the 

write-off of dormant accounts. 

 

b. Long outstanding/dormant accounts 
 

The laxity of Management in monitoring and collecting accounts resulted 

in long outstanding uncollected Due from Officers and Employees totaling P2.075 

million and Other Receivables of P18.332 million aged 10 to 30 years. Details are 

shown in Table 3.

During the exit conference in RR 11, the Chief, Legal Division informed 

that the RR already wrote a letter to the Personnel Adjudication Division of BIR 

NO inquiring the status of the cases filed against the erring RCOs with total 

accountabilities of P11.342 million. 

 

Likewise, RR 15 had sent a letter dated March 8, 2021 to Internal Affairs 

Service of BIR NO inquiring on the status on the formal charges for Grave 

Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty filed against the former RCO.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed: 

 

For RR 6 

a) That henceforth, accountabilities of those who are to resign, retire or 
transfer are collected/settled first before the attendant clearance are 

signed/released; 

 

b) To require the Chiefs of RFD and Administrative and Human Resource 
Management Division (AHRMD) to expedite the issuance of necessary 

demand letters to those with outstanding account balances; and 

 

For RR 8A 

c) To coordinate with RRs 5, 7 and 8B and inquire on the whereabouts of the 
concerned employees.  Once verified, either prepare a demand letter or 

draw JEVs transferring these accounts to these RRs. 

 

c. Non-moving positive and negative SL balances 
 

In RR 7A, further examination of SL balances of Office Supplies Inventory 

and Accountable Forms Inventory accounts disclosed the existence of non-moving 

negative and positive balances for quite a long period of time. The details are 

presented in Table 4.

Further examination of these inactive SLs disclosed that these include 

balances during the conversion of e-NGAS to version 2.0 in CY 2016 per JEV-

2016-01-000001 dated January 1, 2016 which remained non-moving to date.  This 

condition shows lack of proper review and reconciliation of the account by the 

concerned personnel. Inquiry with the said personnel disclosed that reconciliation 

of Inventory accounts was not made due to heavy workloads assigned to her. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to assign personnel who 

will focus on the reconciliation of Inventory accounts to address the issue on 

non-moving positive and negative balances. 

 

d.  Unaccounted difference between the balance per books of RR 8A and the 
Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) balances  

 

The discrepancy of P85,900.67 pertains to unaccounted difference which 

may pertain to prior year’s undelivered items by PS-DBM or deliveries by PS but 

still unrecorded by RR 8A and/or price adjustments which were not reflected in 

either of the two sets of books. The foregoing unaccounted difference affect the 

reliability, accuracy and completeness of the account balance and the fair 

presentation in the FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chiefs of the 

Finance Division and the Property Section of AHRMD to coordinate with the 

PS-DBM in order to resolve the unaccounted difference of P85,900.67. 

 

e. Discrepancy between and GL and Report of Returned DCs 

 

In RR 7A, the accuracy and validity of Other Receivables amounting to 

P31.020 million as at December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) late 

reporting of redemptions of dishonored checks from CYs 2010 to 2019; (b) 

unresolved discrepancy of P0.717 million between the GL and the Report of 

Returned/DCs Redeemed reported by RCD.  

 

The RCD shall furnish the RFD with the copy of the Report of Returned/DCs 

(BIR Form No. 12.58) received from the RDOs, for the appropriate adjustment in 

the RO-Collection Books, and the Report of Returned/DCs Redeemed (BIR Form 

12.61).4  

All RDOs shall prepare their Report on Validated Collections for Booking 

Channel of Payment after performing all the reconciliation procedures under 

existing revenue issuances5, while the RCD shall determine the accuracy of the 

collection report and prepare a written recommendation to be transmitted to the RFD

78 

 

for recognition in the RO-Collection Books.6 BIR Form 12.58 and 12.61 shall be 

prepared and submitted by RDOs to RCD7 within 15 days of the following month.8  

 

Review of the List of DCs Redeemed prepared and validated by RCD for CY 

2020 disclosed that checks totaling P72.066 million redeemed from CYs 2010 to 

2019 were only reported this year.  

 

These DCs redeemed for years prior to decentralization in CY 2016 were 

checks forwarded by the RAD of the BIR NO to the Region for recording. However, 

validation of the redeemed checks was not prioritized by the previous personnel-in-

charge, hence no report was submitted by the RCD to RFD.  It was only during CYs 

2019 and 2020 when reconciliation was extensively started by the RCD. Late 

reporting and recording of redemption of dishonored checks caused the account to be 

overstated for more than 10 years.  

 

Per our inquiry with the RFD, the recognition of redeemed checks cannot be 

timely made in the books on the month it was redeemed since submission of reports 

from RCD is delayed caused by the late validation at their end.  

 

Currently, the RFD and RCD are reconciling both their records against those 

forwarded by the RAD most especially the dishonored checks redeemed years ago. 

From the RAD, the RCD have to validate first the dishonored and redeemed checks 

from the Integrated Tax System (ITS) - Collection and Bank Reconciliation System 

(CBRS) before recommending for recording to RFD. But due to voluminous 

transactions, validation cannot be completed yet. Although through collective efforts, 

both divisions are trying to update the status of the Other Receivables account.  

 

Based on the foregoing, it is highly probable that some, if not all, of the 

outstanding receivables from DCs were already redeemed causing the account in the 

FSs not fairly presented.  

 

Moreover, comparison of the dishonored checks redeemed in the submitted 

Report of Returned/DCs Redeemed as of December 31, 2020 and per books revealed 

a discrepancy of P0.717 million, as presented in Table 5.

The RFD did not recognize the foregoing redeemed checks due to discrepancies 

in the data recorded in the books such as TP, TIN, no record that it was previously 

dishonored and that some were already recorded as redeemed. According to RFD, the 

discrepancy was already reported to RCD for correction and further validation. The 

RCD is yet to validate these checks in the ITS-CBRS again and if it cannot be resolved 

within the division, it will be referred to the RDO concerned.  

 

While RMO 36-2016 dated June 30, 2016 focused on the decentralization of 

recording and reporting of internal revenue taxes to the regional offices and did not 

mention about the recognition of the redemption of DCs in the regional books of 

accounts, timely submission and reporting of revenues shall not be compromised as the 

incomplete and delayed reporting of the DCs and their redemption had affected the 

accuracy and reliability of the Other Receivables account. 

 

 

 



80 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the RCD to: 

 

a) Intensify and continue the reconciliation with RFD and RDOs to cleanse the 
books most especially the DCs that were already redeemed; and 

 

b) Submit to RFD the required reports within the prescribed period to facilitate 
the timely recording and adjustments of the Other Receivables account.  

 

Management comments: 

 

Continuous reconciliation is being undertaken by the RCD to address the 

outstanding balances of the DCs covering CY 2015 and prior years.  This pertains to 

DCs that were transferred by the RAD and recorded in the RO-Collection Books and 

those DCs covering CY 2016 and onwards. Consequently, close monitoring is being 

made by the Office to ensure that the balances of the DCs under the Other Receivables 

account are fairly presented. 

 

The RCD has been consistent in its effort to decrease the outstanding DCs 

recorded in the books thru close and proper coordination with the RFD and the 

respective RDOs. Timely submission of the required reports within the prescribed 

period are strictly observed and necessary updates on the Other Receivables account 

are properly effected. 

  

f. Internal control lapses in the requisition, issuance, reporting and custody of 
Accountable Forms resulting in missing/unaccounted forms  

 

Internal control lapses were noted the in the requisition, issuance, reporting and 

custody of Accountable Forms in RRs 1, 2, 7B and 8B resulting in missing/unaccounted 

forms. 

 

RR 1 - missing unaccounted Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) 

 

In RR 1, audit revealed that 18,000 pieces of  DSTs equivalent to P270,000 had 

been missing/unaccounted. These DSTs were under the accountability of the 

Administrative Section Chief (AO for brevity) of RDO No. 1.  

 

A strong and responsive internal control system is an essential component of an 

organization’s internal and external processes. It can significantly enhance the integrity 

of operations and improve organizational outcomes and results to achieve sectoral 

goals. The responsibility of establishing an effective internal control system rests with 

the agency head as provided in Section 124 of PD No. 1445 and Section 1, Chapter 1, 

Subtitle B, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, which provides that “All 

resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with 

law and regulations and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper 

disposition to ensure efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 

government.” 



81 

 

 

The Audit Team conducted an examination on the AO in relation to her 

accountability to the accountable forms under her custody, wherein it was found out 

that she maintained numerous stocks of DSTs during end of the year starting from 

December 2015 to June 30, 2020.  

 

As at June 30, 2020, the ending inventory of DST per audit was 48,000 pieces 

with monetary value of P0.720 million. The result of the audit was compared to the 

monthly RAAF submitted by the AO for the same period, wherein the reported ending 

inventory was only 30,000 pieces equivalent to P450,000, hence, a difference of 18,000 

pieces or P270,000 representing the missing/unaccounted DSTs.  

  
It was also observed during the audit that some of the monthly RAAF submitted 

by the AO during CY 2018 were erroneous and incomplete which also came to the 

attention of the RFD, wherein it issued a certification to prove this matter.  Eventually, 

conflicting entries in her RAAF were discovered such as: (a) the balance of ending 

inventory of the previous month does not the tally with the balance of beginning 

inventory of the current month; and (b) erroneous encoding in the serial number of the 

DSTs.  

 

Despite of her incomplete and erroneous reports, the Audit Team was able to 

come up with a Summary Report of DST Requisitions from the RR and Summary 

Report of DST Issuances. With the beginning inventory of 17,000 pieces as of January 

1, 2015, the district requested 1.36 million pieces of DST from the RR equivalent to 

P20.400 million from January 2015 to June 2020. Meanwhile, for the same period, 

1.329 million pieces of DST or P19.935 million were issued by the AO to Collecting 

Officers of RDO 1 duly supported by RIS and Invoice.  

       

After verifying the documents, the Audit Team was able to identify the specific 

serial numbers of DSTs that are missing/ unaccounted, and their corresponding 

monetary value, in Table 6:  
 

Table 6. Missing/Unaccounted DSTs 
Period Serial Nos. Quantity Amount (in P) 

April 2018 11560001 11570000 10,000 150,000 

May 2018 3750001 3751000 1,000 15,000 

October 2018 5775001 5780000 5,000 75,000 

November 2018 751001 753000 2,000 30,000 

Total   18,000 270,000 

 

The information above substantiates the initial audit that there were 18,000 

pieces of DST or P0.270 million not found in the AO’s monthly RAAF.  The said DSTs 

were declared missing/unaccounted in the month that supposed to be they were issued 

to the Collecting Officers, considering that the agency observed the “First in- First out” 

policy in the issuance of accountable forms. 

 



82 

 

Moreover, the AO maintained an excessive inventory of DST particularly in the 

period of April to November 30, 2018, where the misappropriation of DST took place. 

One of the highest in terms of quantity and monetary value of DSTs transpired in May 

2018 with 78,000 pieces or P1.170 million in her accountability. This was followed by 

April, June and July of the same year.  

 

The Audit Team discussed the results of the audit in a teleconference meeting 

on August 11, 2020 with the AO together with her Revenue District Officer, and the 

Section Chiefs of the RFD and AHRMD. Electronic copies of the audit working papers 

were sent two days prior to the said meeting. The AO was given the opportunity to 

explain the issues raised by the Audit Team and admitted her lapses in the handling of 

DSTs. She committed to: (1) review the results of the audit; and (2) to restitute as soon 

as possible the corresponding value of the DSTs found to be missing/unaccounted. 

 

The AO restituted the amounts of P255,000 under OR No. AFC201400468510 

dated August 20, 2020, and P15,000.00 under OR No. 2020-173921-000049 dated 

August 28, 2020, or a total of P270,000.  

 

The results of the audit confirmed that there were lapses committed in the 

requisition, issuance and handling of accountable forms particularly in the DST. 

Certainly, the irregularities discovered will not occur if management implements an 

effective internal control to monitor the accountability of the AO. The following are 

the internal control lapses identified by the Audit Team in relation to the missing DSTs: 

 

1. Absence of proper planning and timing in the requisition of accountable forms; 
 

2. Failure of the Revenue District Officer to review the veracity of the monthly 
RAAF prepared by AO prior to the approval of the RIS which lead to 

unwarranted requisition of accountable forms;  

 

3. The Revenue District Officer approved the RIS without verifying the inventory 
balance per report as against the actual inventory on hand; 

 

4. The District did not set up an ideal stock threshold on its accountable forms 
(Reorder Point of Inventory); 

 

5. The RFD records the issuance of accountable forms to RDOs as expense, in 
which case, it will be very difficult to monitor the accountability of the District 

Offices in relation to the inventory balance on-hand at a given period; and   

 

6. Lack of proper coordination among the following offices in monitoring the 
requisition, issuance, and inventory balance of accountable forms.  

 

a. AHRMD - responsible in approving and verifying the requisition of 
accountable forms requested by the RDO; 



83 

 

b. RFD - tasked to monitor the requisition and issuance of accountable forms 
from Admin Chief to RCO and RCO to taxpayer; and 

 

c. Revenue District Officers - tasked to submit the monthly RAAF prepared 
by the Administrative Chief and conduct periodic physical inventory of 

accountable forms.   

 

In terms of liability, the AO would still be liable for the crime of Malversation 

of Public Funds provided in Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).  

 

On the other hand, Section 12(a) of the RPC for BIR Officials and Employees 

states:  

 

“Every Revenue Official or Employee shall be accountable for any money, 

property or other thing of valued received by, or coming into, his/ her custody 

in connection with the discharge of his/her duties and/or relating to 

enforcement of internal revenue laws, which must be accounted for and 

deposited in accordance with established procedures.  

 

Non-compliance therewith shall be considered as Gross Neglect of Duty and 

shall constitute as a grave offense.”  

 

Although, the missing DSTs were restituted prior to the issuance of demand 

letter, such act is a clear indication of unauthorized use resulting to misappropriation 

of taxpayer’s money which the AO could be held liable.   

 

We recommended that Management file appropriate criminal and 

administrative charges against the AO for the crime of malversation of public 

funds punishable under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code.  We also 

recommended that the agency head review the existing internal control as regards 

the safeguarding of accountable forms and implement reforms to address the 

lapses discovered by the Audit Team.  

 

The Regional Director (RD) of RR 1 instructed the Regional Investigation 

Division (RID) to conduct preliminary investigation. The result of the investigation 

was submitted by the RID to the Office of the Regional Director and indorsed the same 

to the Internal Affairs Service (IAS) of BIR NO last November 26, 2020.  On January 

20, 2021, the Revenue District Officer issued a memorandum relieving the AO as 

custodian of accountable forms in view of the results of audit and pending resolution 

of her case by the IAS.  

 

RR 7B - Unaccounted balance of Accountable Forms Inventory 

 

Audit of the Accountable Forms Inventory in RR 7B revealed unrecorded 

receipts and issuances. However, even if the unrecorded receipts and issuances be

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the RFD and 

AHRMD to continue the reconciliation/analysis of the unaccounted difference in 

the Accountable Forms Inventory account. 

  

RRs 2 and 8 - Unreliable balances in the RAAFs 

 

Verification of the RAAFs submitted by the AOs of the different RDOs of RR 

2 for the period January 1, 2018 to August 31, 2020 disclosed the following: 

 

a. Issuance of accountable forms as reflected in the AOs’ RAAFs were not 
supported with pertinent documents. 

 

 There were no supporting documents submitted for the issuance of Loose 
Documentary Stamps by RDOs 10, 11 and 12 with an aggregate amount 

of P1.253 million; 

 

 Usage of 5,462 postage stamps by RDOs 7 and 10 with a total amount of 
P65,267.00 had no supporting documents.  

 

 Pertinent documents to support the issuance/usage of some accountable 
forms without money value that were reported in the RAAF were not 

submitted.   

 

b. Several receipts of Accountable Forms with Money Value were not 
recorded or erroneously recorded in the RAAF. 

 

 The audit team noted that there were issuances of Accountable Forms 
with Money Value reported by the Administrative Chief of the Regional 

Office to the AOs of RDO 7 as evidenced by duly accomplished 

Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), however, these were not reported in the 

RAAF submitted by the receiving AOs. The total amount of the money 

value of the unrecorded receipts was P171,000.00 

 

 Receipt by the AO of RDO 7 of 1,200 pieces of postage stamps with face 
value of P2.00 in March 2020 was recorded as 1,000 pieces thereby 



85 

 

resulting in an understatement of the received postage stamps by 200 

pieces. 

 

 Erroneous postings of receipts and issuances of accountable forms were 
observed in the submitted RAAFs by the AO of RDO 10 for the period 

covering October 2019 to March 2020. 

 

c. Usage of Postage Stamps were inconsistent with supporting documents 
submitted. 

 

 Verification of the supporting papers submitted to document the usage 
of postage stamps cannot be reconciled with the quantities used as 

recorded in the RAAF of RDOs 7 and 10.  The unreconciled RAAF with 

supporting documents of RDO 7 were for the months of September and 

October 2019 and February, March, July and August 2020.  For RDO 10, 

the unreconciled RAAF with supporting documents covers the month of 

August 2020. 

 

In RR 8B, the balance of accountability of the Supply Officer cannot be 

established and reconciled with the accounting records due to exclusion of 12 SL 

accounts in the monthly RAAF. Inquiry with the Supply Officer revealed that she 

forgot to include these accountable forms but assured the inclusion of these in the 

succeeding RAAF to be submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned AOs 

to submit the supporting documents for the issuance/usage of accountable forms. 

 

g. Discrepancies between the book balance and RPCI 
 

The RPCI shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of 

inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and 

per count and shortage/overage, if any.9.      

 

As at December 31, 2020, the BIR reported an Inventory Accounts balance 

of  P452.025 million.  However, comparison of the RPCIs with the GL balances of 

RRs 7A, 9B, 12, 13, 16 , 17 and 19  revealed a variance P57.761 million due to (a) 

items existing in the books but not reported in the RPCI nor found during physical 

count and vice versa; (b) difference in unit cost and quantity in the two report; and 

(c) double recording in the RPCI. 

 

In RR 7A, the Audit Team also evaluated Management’s compliance on the 

rules and policies in the management and safeguarding of the inventories. Table 7 

shows several inactions and deficiencies in the preparation and maintenance of 

records, forms and monitoring reports, which serve a vital part in the protection and

Again, these inactions and deficiencies in the preparation and maintenance 

of records, forms and monitoring reports were contributing factors to the issues 

and findings discussed. We emphasize/reiterate that proper preparation and 

maintenance of the said reports according to standards will help lessen, if not 

eliminate, errors/deficiencies in handling inventories. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the RFD and 

AHRMD: 

 

a) Determine the status of the recognized inventories not reported in the 
RPCI/not found during the physical count and retrieve RIS and RSMI 

pertaining to these missing inventories;  

 

b) For those with unreconciled quantity and cost, determine the correct 
amount and adjust the affected records accordingly; 

 

AHRMD of RR 7A to: 

 

c) Prepare the RSMI in accordance with the instruction in Appendix 64, 
Volume I of the GAM for NGAs;  

 

d) Secure file copies of DRs and maintain a list of all delivered, inspected 
and accepted supplies/inventories for easy monitoring; 

 

e) Adjust those inventories reported twice in the RPCI; 
 

f) Maintain/update SCs for every class of inventory; 
 

g) Adhere to the standard procedures in assigning serial/control numbers 
of RIS and RSMI for easy monitoring; and 

 

h) Ensure that all other records, forms and reports are prepared and 
maintained according to procedures/criteria enumerated above; 

 

h. Unreconciled balance between the GL and RPCPPE  
 

The balance of PPE as at December 31, 2020 of P6.482 billion cannot 

be relied upon due to the discrepancy with the reported amount in the RPCPPE 

due to:  

 

a) PPE items not found during physical count/not reported in the RPCPPE; 
b) The difference in acquisition cost recorded in the books and RPCPPE; 
c) Difference in the account used/recorded in the books and in the RPCPPE; 

and  

d) Unrecorded purchases in the RPCPPE; (e) Semi-expendable items 
reported as PPE in RPCPPE and other deficiencies noted in the RPCPPE.  



89 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the RFD and 

AHRMD to: 

 

a) Coordinate closely in reconciling the discrepancy/ies per count as 
against book balances of PPE;  

 

b) Investigate the cause for the recorded in the books but not in 
RPCPPEs and vice-versa; 

 

c) Determine the correct acquisition cost of the items;  
 

d) Determine the proper classification of the affected accounts; and 
 

e) Transfer all the semi-expendable items reported in the RPCPPE to 
the RPCI. 

 

i. Deficiencies in property management and administration of FPAs 
 

It is the BIR Management’s responsibility to present fair and reliable 

information about the FPAs in the FSs through compliance with the required 

financial reporting standards.10 Among the relevant accounting principles and 

policies are the following: 
 

a) An asset arising from non-exchange transactions (e.g. taxes) are 
recognized if:  (i) it meets the asset definition, meaning its controlled by 

an entity as a result of past events, and from which future economic 

benefits or service potential are expected to flow to the entity;11 and (ii) it 

meets the recognition criteria, meaning, the inflow of the economic 

benefits or service potential are probable and measurable.12 
 

b) There is a control of an asset if an entity has the ability to exclude or 
regulate the access of others to the benefits of an asset as evidenced by 

their enforceable claim of resources.13 
 

c) Assets held for sale acquired through non-exchange transactions are 
measured at fair value at their acquisition14 and shall disclose the fair 

value less cost to sell of the items in the notes to FS.15

d) An entity shall disclose either on the face of, or in the notes to FS the 
amount of assets or contingent assets that are subject to restrictions and 

the nature of those restrictions.16 

 

e) An entity shall disclose in the notes to FS supporting and additional 
information for items in the face of the FS that are required and relevant 

for the understanding of the FS.17 

 

 Discrepancy between the GL and CISFA   
 

The CISFA is prepared annually for monitoring and verification of the 

FPAs (both personal and real properties) under the respective custody of 

BIR’s implementing units.  

 

As at December 31, 2020, the BIR reported a balance of the FPAs 

amounting to P252.721 million.  This amount however, is misstated due to 

the difference of P47.631 million between the recorded amount in the books 

and in the CISFA as shown in Table 8.

91 

 

 Laxity in the management of FPAs 
 

RRs 15 and 19 did not properly administer and manage the 32 FPAs with 

a total zonal value of P176.168 million due to the non-imposition of legal rights 

or ownership over unauthorized occupants or informal settlers despite transfer 

of title to the Republic of the Philippines (ROP).  Moreover, the non-conversion 

into cash through auction sale of 87 FPAs of RRs 8A, 8B, 10, 11, 15 and 19 has 

deprived the government of the possible income that can be derived therefrom, 

of which titles of 55 FPAs have been transferred to the ROP while 32 are still in 

the process of consolidation of titles.  

 

RMO No. 13-2014 dated February 25, 2014 provides the policies, 

guidelines and procedures in the management, sale/disposal of 

acquired/forfeited assets for both Absolutely Forfeited Personal and Real 

Properties. Salient features of which are as follows: 

 

a. Paragraph 1.5, Chapter III (on management and administration of 
acquired/forfeited assets) -  All acquired real properties transferred in the 

name of the Republic of the Philippines, having passed the one-year 

redemption period, shall be converted into cash by way of public and/or 

private sale, as the case may be, in accordance with the existing tax laws, 

rules and regulations, within three (3) years from the date of 

acquisition/forfeiture and/or seizure thereof, unless there are justifiable and 

valid reasons for the non-disposition of these properties within the aforesaid 

period. 

 

b. Paragraph 1.10 Chapter III - All acquired real properties classified as 
agricultural and occupied by farmers, and/or even without tillers shall be 

communicated immediately with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) 

and the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) pursuant to the provisions of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 407 dated June 14, 1990 and Republic Act (RA) 

6657, or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), as amended, to 

determine whether or not the acquired assets are, in reality, suitable for 

agriculture. All acquired agricultural real properties that will be declared as 

suitable for agriculture by the DAR and LBP shall be transferred 

immediately to the DAR subject to existing laws, rules and regulations on 

just compensation to the BIR. 

 

 Non-imposition of legal rights 
 

Review of the CISFA of RR 15, revealed that three real properties under 

the administration of RR 15 remained unsold or undisposed for 24 years. This 

indicates BIR’s inability to dispose FPAs, which is vital, since BIR’s mandate 

pertains to collection and assessment of taxes and not property management. 

 



92 

 

The listed FPAs pertains to lands that were forfeited in favor of the 

government in satisfaction of the tax liabilities of two taxpayers amounting to 

P28,640.00. The land titles were duly transferred in the name of Government of 

the Philippines in CY 1996 and have total zonal value of P1,324,580.00 as at 

December 31, 2020. 

 

Inquiry with the Management disclosed that ocular inspection was made 

by the Revenue District Officer of RDO 91-Dipolog City last October 23, 2020 

on two FPAs located in Gutalac, Zamboanga del Norte (ZDN). It was observed 

that there were private individuals occupying the land and allegedly possessed 

Transfer Certificate of Titles (TCTs). Likewise, the TCT of the FPA located in 

Sindangan, ZDN was duly transferred to the name of the Government on July 

31, 1996. However, prior to the issuance of a title, it was found out that a TCT 

over the same property have been already issued to three other individuals. 

 

Duplication of titles impedes the BIR to establish ownership over the lands. 

According to the Regional Director, who was also the former Revenue District 

Officer of Dipolog City at the time of seizure, the transfer of title is impossible 

because it was already turned over to the DAR. On the other hand, FPAs already 

under the name of ROP still cannot be easily disposed because of the same 

reason. Moreover, pursuing legal actions means also filing a case against the 

DAR which distributed the land to beneficiaries, the Registry of Deeds who 

issued Titles to various claimants without cancelling the earlier title, and to 

occupants who were mere beneficiaries of another government project. Filing of 

case against co-government agency seems inappropriate. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, RR 19 has administered and maintained a total 

of 29 lots of forfeited properties from the four RDOs aggregating to 290,527 m2 

and P13.839 million in terms of land area and cost, respectively, as shown in the 

FSs for Fund 104, with breakdown shown in Table 9.

forfeiture date 

Total 29    290,527   13,839,157.78  

 

It can be gleaned from the above data that 27 out of 29 lots have been in 

the custody of the RR for more than two decades already yet have remained not 

disposed of in accordance with the above cited BIR RMO.  Examination of 

records disclosed that that the zonal value for all 29 FPAs, which is the main 

source of information for the floor price, aggregated to P174.844 million. This 

amount could add to the government coffer if all properties will be successfully 

auctioned. The details are presented in Table 10.

The audit team also observed that three lots totaling 207,000 m2 or 71.25 

per cent of the total land area pertain to agricultural properties which are required 

to be transferred to the DAR at just compensation pursuant to EO No. 407 and 

RA No. 6657. 

 

Inspection of documents also disclosed that there are three main factors 

which could significantly affect the marketability of these forfeited assets, 

namely: (a) presence of unauthorized occupants or informal settlers in 15 

properties which are mostly the former owners/defaulting taxpayers, their heirs 

or relatives, notwithstanding the transfer of title to the ROP; (b)  structures or 

improvements such as houses, manufacturing area, or subdivision amenities 

such as concrete covered stage, playground, multipurpose building and Chapel 

were erected in 19 properties; and (c) remoteness of the location, limited 

accessibility for public transportation and flood susceptibility or vulnerability to 

natural calamities for some properties. The breakdown for the first two factors 

is provided in Table 11.

These factors could potentially discourage the prospective bidders as they 

would have to shoulder the filing of the necessary legal action for the ejection of 

informal settlers or pay for the existing structures or its demolition, in case the 

winning bidder is not the current occupant/settler. These costs are on top of the 

other expenses necessary for the transfer of ownership and issuance of the 

necessary certificate of title and/or tax declaration. 

 

                                                 
18 Excludes unsubmitted details of five FPAs of RDO 114-Mati, Davao Oriental 



94 

 

These real properties have been in the custody of the RRs for such a long 

time and the responsibility for safeguarding these properties and their timely 

conversion to cash lies with the Collection Division. The inaction of the division 

deprived the government to revenue and benefits derived in the disposition of 

the properties. Moreover, the government lost economically by having the 

government resources tied up in non-liquid, immovable and unconverted 

forfeited real properties, instead of having converted into cash and spent the 

same on government programs, projects and activities. 

 

Further, these deficiencies precluded the disposition of the FPAs which 

were meant to recover taxes from delinquent taxpayers. The Bureau had not 

imposed its legal rights and ownership despite the transfer of title to the 

Government, thereby falling short in safeguarding these assets or government 

resources. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that: 

 

RR 15: 

 

a) Require the Legal Division, RFD and RCD, as well as the RDO 91-
Dipolog City, to work hand-in-hand in tracing the details of these FPAs 

and establish if the Bureau is the rightful owner of these assets; 
 

RR 19: 

 

b) Enforce legal action against the unauthorized occupants or informal 
settlers, and take over the administration of the FPAs to attract 

prospective or potential buyers; 

 

c) Coordinate with the DAR for the transfer of three agricultural 
properties subject to just compensation in accordance with EO No. 407 

and RA No. 6657; and  
 

d) Require the personnel of RDO No. 114, Davao Oriental to submit their 
ocular inspection reports to the Office of the Auditor. 

 

Management comments: 

 

For RR 15, Management commented that the Bureau does not possess the 

complete dockets of the case of the two properties located in Gutalac, ZDN, however, 

based on initial verification, the Real Property Tax Declarations for the said properties 

were indeed in the name of BIR. The RR requested from the NO for the complete 

dockets of the case or any additional records that would help the RR determine the 

appropriate actions to be taken. 

 



95 

 

For the FPA distributed to DAR beneficiaries, Management is still in the 

process of determining the best recourse of action under the circumstance. As of the 

last inquiry, DAR beneficiaries have been in possession of the said property way back 

in 1992 by virtue of land titles issued to them in line with the Comprehensive Agrarian 

Reform Program (CARP) of the DAR. Said titles were issued to the beneficiaries 

without the Registry of Deeds cancelling the original title in the name of the taxpayer. 

It was on July 31, 1996 when the original title was cancelled and a new one was issued 

to the BIR. 

 

The Management shall continue to work together in tracing and determining the 

rightful ownership of the FPAs recorded in the books. 

 

For RR 19, it acknowledged that most properties have illegal settlers for which 

it described as an inherited problem from the BIR NO. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

For RR 19, the Audit Team is not amenable to the notion that the problem 

emanated from the BIR-NO as it is clearly stipulated in the RMO that the 

administration of such FPAs falls within the jurisdiction of the district where the 

property is situated. It is impracticable for the NO to oversee and manage all the 

properties of the Bureau nationwide. While it is also true that it already scheduled the 

auction proceeding in the current year, the laxity of management is manifested in its 

inability to conduct the necessary procedures considering that these properties have 

been in the custody of the Bureau and were titled under the name of the ROP for almost 

two decades. 

 

 FPAs not yet converted into cash and not titled in the name of the ROP  
 

With the issuance of Revenue Administrative Order (RAO) No. 6-2017 

dated September 27, 2017, the following undertakings which were previously done 

or the responsibility of RDOs had been transferred to the FAMU: 

 

a. Conduct of auction sale of all seized and forfeited properties for concerned 
regions (Mega Manila Regions including RR8A), LTS and the ARMD; and 

 

b. The registration/transfer and/or consolidation of titles of all real properties that 
were declared forfeited in the name of the ROP.  

 

Also, as explicitly provided in the foregoing RMO No. 13-2014, all 

acquired real properties transferred in the name of the ROP, having passed the one-

year redemption period, shall be converted into cash by way of public and/or private 

sale, as the case may be, in accordance with the existing tax laws, rules and 

regulations, within three years from the date of acquisition/forfeiture and/or seizure 

thereof, unless there are justifiable and valid reasons for the non-disposition of these 

properties within the aforesaid period. 



96 

 

 

Records revealed that as at December 31, 2020, 87 FPAs of RRs 8A, 8B, 10, 

11, 15 and 19 remained undisposed with a total cost of P22.229 million. Of the total 

FPAs, 55 are already titled in the name of the ROP while 32 are still in the process 

of consolidation of titles. These FPAs remained in the property management 

jurisdiction of the RRs for more than three years, except for RR 8A and RR 8B, of 

which responsibility is transferred to FAMU. However, these RRs still failed to 

dispose these through auction sale, thus depriving the government of the possible 

income derived therefrom. The details are presented in Table 11.

For RR15 (With Titles) - 3 FPAs have existing issues as discussed above 

For RR19 (With Titles) - Inclusive of 3 agricultural lots 

 

The Audit Teams of RRs 8A and 8B obtained from BIR-NO, eight Notices 

of Sale/Public Auction of FPAs (three, from RR 8A and five, from RR 8B).  These 

scheduled auctions all resulted in a “failure of bidding”.  

 

For RR 11, the auction sale was conducted on May 5, 2021, but it was 

declared as a failure since no bidders attended the said bidding. The Audit Team was 

informed that it was already the 2nd failed bidding of the aforementioned properties, 

to which the 1st auction sale was conducted last April, 2019. 

 

For RR 15, the Management was constrained from disposing the FPAs as 

the Transfer of Titles, although already in the name of the ROP have already been 

turned-over to the DAR which distributed the land to the beneficiaries. 

 

For RR 19, interview with the Collection Division personnel disclosed the 

following: 

 

a) They initially scheduled the auction proceeding in December 2020 for 
the 12 forfeited properties but they were advised by the FAMU to 

dispose all 29 properties instead of mere piecemeal auction.  

 

b) They were also advised by the AHRMD personnel to defer the auction 
proceeding to CY 2021 as they were time-constrained in processing the

payment for the publication of the Notice of Sale in a newspaper of 

general circulation as year-end was already drawing near.  

 

c) They re-scheduled the auction proceeding for all properties on the last 
week of March 2021 or early April 2021 to utilize the current year’s 

budget; and 

 

d) On the aspect of property administration, they explained that it is the 
primary duty of every Revenue District Officer as property 

administrator to manage and administer the FPAs under his/her 

jurisdiction. 

 

As to the FPAs which are not yet titled in the name of the ROP, inquiry 

made with FAMU, for RRs 8A and 8B and the OIC-Chief, Arrears Management 

Section of RR 11 disclosed that they are really having a hard time in the 

consolidation of titles or transfer of forfeited real properties in the name of the 

government due to the legal issues or encumbrances attached to the FPAs as well as 

absence of records with the Registry of Deeds. 

 

The non-transfer of those aforementioned untitled properties in the name of 

the ROP casts doubt on the absolute ownership of the government on those assets, 

thus depriving the government of the possible income derived from its future sale. 

 

We recommended to the Management of: 

 

RRs 8A and 8B to require the RCD to: 

 

a) Coordinate with FAMU (i) for possible inclusion in the next auction sale of 
FPAs of the Region; and (ii) request for the immediate consolidation of 

titles of the FPAs of both Regions; 

 

RR 11 to: 

 

b) Require the OIC-Chief, Arrears Management Section to submit a report 
on the reason/s for the non-conversion of these assets to cash; 

 

c) Require RDOs 73 and 75 to undertake the registration/consolidation of 
untitled properties in the name of ROP; and 

 

RRs 10 and 19 to: 

 

d) Conduct an auction sale of forfeited assets/properties for 36 FPAs 
following the guidelines prescribed in RMO No. 13-2014. 

 

 

 



98 

 

Management Comments:  
 

For RR 10, the Management prepared an action plan to dispose the forfeited 

assets as part of their Arrears Management Program. These properties are subject to 

inspection before they can be disposed. 

 

For RR 19, Management informed that the auction sale was pushed through on 

April 28, 2021, which resulted to the following: 

 

i. Of the 29 forfeited lots/properties, only three lots were successfully 
auctioned;  

ii. There were four registered/qualified bidders who participated for the 
Auction, two of which tendered bid for one lot. 

iii. The total floor price which was derived from the zonal value was P1.791 
million while the total collections (excluding the Bid Bond of the losing 

bidder) was P1.803 million leaving an excess of collection over floor price 

in the amount of P12,500.00. 

iv. Other unsold lots will be subjected to negotiated sale, according to the Bid 
and Awards Committee-Acquired Assets.  

 

 Lacking/Inaccurate information in the Notes to FSs 
 

The Notes to FSs shall provide additional information that is not presented 

on the face of the statement of financial position, statement of financial 

performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, or cash flow statement, but 

that is relevant to an understanding of any of them.21 

 

It is the BIR Management’s responsibility to present fair and reliable 

information about the FPA in the FSs through compliance with the required 

financial reporting standards.22 Among the relevant accounting principles and 

policies are the following: 
 

a. An entity shall disclose either on the face of, or in the Notes to FS the 
amount of assets or contingent assets that are subject to restrictions and the 

nature of those restrictions;23and 
 

b. An entity shall disclose in the Notes to FS supporting and additional 
information for items in the face of the FS that are required and relevant 

for the understanding of the FS.24 

 

For CY 2020, Table 12 presents the information pertaining to FPAs that 

were not disclosed by the concerned RRs.

The real properties in the CISFA are, primarily intended for sale through 

public auction, negotiated sale, or transfer to relevant government agencies (e.g., 

the DAR) at fair value. Since the cost of sale is shouldered by the buyers of the 

assets on an “as is where is” basis, BIR must disclose in the Notes to FS the fair 

value of the real property items in CISFA as at December 31, 2020. 

 

The total area, aging of the FPAs and other related information are relevant 

for transparency and accountability in its custodial function of the FPAs. We 

believe that disclosure of the information is relevant to the understanding of BIR’s 

operation and performance, as is the purpose of the FS. Since BIR manages, 

monitors and is accountable for the disposal of these properties, the aging schedule 

will provide as indicators of how the BIR fares with its mandate, specifically on the 

sale or disposal of these FPAs. 

 

Also, the disclosure of these information could have been looked into by 

the relevant government agencies for possible use in their respective programs and 

projects. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that: 

 

a) RR 8A and 8B require the RFDs to disclose in the Notes to FSs (NG 
books) all relevant information on the FPAs; and 

  

b) RR 15 require the RFD to fully disclose in the Notes to FSs the details and 
status of all the FPAs, including the current fair market value or zonal 

value of the property of one FPA with title not transferred in the name 

of the Philippines. 

 

j. Absence of documents to support the recorded accounts payable 
 

The validity and obligations of RR 7A’s Due to Officers and Employees 

amounting to P20.796 million and RR 17’s Accounts Payable amounting to P7.181 



100 

 

million cannot be acsertained in the absence of sufficient documents to support the 

claims. Moreover, the Accounts Payable disclosed in the Notes to FSs of RR 17 

amounted to only P5.790 million or a variance of P1.391 million. 

 

Management shall review the transactions especially at year-end and ensure 

that claims against the government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation25 and that all lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during 

the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year26, hence, goods and services 

already delivered/rendered but documentation/billings of which have not been 

received shall be accrued and recorded as payables.27  

 

No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless obligation is 

founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and 

unless there is proper authority for its incurrence. Any certification for a non-

existent or fictitious obligation and/or creditor shall be considered void.28 

 

It must be emphasized that claims for salaries and allowances for employees 

deleted from the payroll shall be supported at least with approved payroll, approved 

Daily Time Record (DTR), Notice of Assumption and approved Application for 

Leave.29 Likewise, reimbursement of travelling allowances shall be evidenced 

primarily with office/travel order, duly approved itinerary of travel, certificate of 

appearance/attendance and certificate of travel completed.30 Documents supporting 

the claims should be properly validated to determine which are to be recorded, 

retained and to be reverted. 

 

 Insufficient evidence to support valid claims 
 

In RR 7A, inquiry with the RFD disclosed that the recognized payables 

under 118 JEVs for salaries, allowances and personnel benefits at year-end totaling 

P15.437 million, were supported only with List of Money Claims - Request for 

Funding for those cancelled or dropped from the payroll prepared and signed by 

the Administrative Officer of AHRMD alone. According to the preparer, the 

purpose of submitting such document is to ensure that this be obligated in 

anticipation that employees may process their claims. This is regardless whether 

they are entitled or not since DTRs and Application for Leave are yet to be 

submitted. Determination on whether or not the claimant is rightfully entitled is 

only made during processing of payment. This practice is not in accordance with 

Section 37, Chapter 2, Volume 1, GAM for NGAs and COA Circular No. 2012-

001. 

 

                                                 
25 Item F, Section 5, Chapter 2 - General Provisions, Basic Standards and Policies, Volume 1, GAM for NGAs  
26 Section 119, PD No. 1445

28 Section 37, Chapter 2 -  General Provisions, Basic Standards and Policies, Volume 1, GAM for NGAs  
29 Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 
30 Section 1.2.4, Ibid.  



101 

 

The process of setting-up of the payables at year-end is vital in ensuring that 

the balance of the account to be reflected in the FS is accurate. However, RFD’s 

reliance on List of Money Claims - Request for Funding is not sufficient to 

represent valid payables.  

 

Moreover, the recorded Due to Officers and Employees of RR 17 totaling 

P5.359 million could not be verified since there were no JEVs and corresponding 

supporting documents submitted to substantiate the recorded payables. 

 

Thus, based on the foregoing, payables recorded at year-end cannot be 

ascertained whether they constitute valid claim sans sufficient evidence to support 

such.  

 

 Recording of payables for the purchase of inventories not yet delivered 
 

On the other hand, in RR 17, random verification of the significant amount 

of recorded Accounts Payable revealed that P4.897 million pertained to the 

prepared Purchase Order (PO) No. 20-PO-12-218, for office supplies. Scrutiny of 

the PO and the Agency Procurement Request (APR) showed that both were dated 

December 28, 2020 which is the last working day of the year. Though these were 

already approved by the concerned officials and was even certified by the 

Accountant that funds are available, it was found out as of February 16, 2021 that 

these documents are still in the custody of the Supply Section and were not yet 

forwarded or transacted to the PS-DBM-Butuan, for the latter’s official acceptance 

or conforme of the specified orders. 

 

It was also uncovered that the items contained in the PO/APR are mostly in 

quantities exceeding the normal three-month requirement, specifically for the A4 

and legal sizes bond papers that were quantified up to 6,136 and 6,506 with total 

costs of P1.099 million and P1.237 million, respectively. This volume of bond 

papers is way too much and could surely fill an entire room of the office. Even if 

these will be distributed to different RDOs immediately or will not be taken at PS-

DBM in entirety, considering that there is no urgency of need for these supplies in 

this time of pandemic, these orders are impractical and would unnecessarily tie up 

the government’s money.  

 

Further verification unveiled that the quantities in the said PO/APR were 

based on the consolidated Annual Procurement Plan for Common Use Supplies and 

Materials intended for CY 2021. It is quite strange that the agency already 

predetermined accounts payable in December 2020 even without appropriate 

substantiation to establish validity of claim and much more that it was for future 

use. 

 

The same was true with the recorded Accounts Payable amounting to 

P281,651.77, which pertained to PO No. 20-PO-12-217 dated December 28, 2020 

for PS-DBM-Butuan. These PO and APR were also duly approved by the Agency 



102 

 

Head and was certified by the Chief of Finance that funds are available. However, 

it was discovered that these documents are not yet processed at the time of audit. 

 

In addition, there was also no actual delivery of supplies pertaining to the 

said POs. Given all of the above circumstances, the two above cases could neither 

pass as Due and Demandable Obligations nor Not Yet Due and Demandable 

Obligations31 for the apparent reason that RR 17 had technically no obligation yet 

to PS-DBM, since the POs and APRs were not perfected contracts. The POs did 

not bind the government to the immediate or eventual payment of a sum of money, 

as there was clearly no transaction or purchase yet that transpired as at December 

31, 2020. 

 

As such, the booked Accounts Payable pertaining to the office supplies and 

other office supplies discussed above, totaling to P5.178 million were both invalid 

claims and a clear departure from the aforesaid guidelines. Hence, this gave us the 

impression that it was just made to circumvent the reversion of funds. 

 

We recommended and Management of RRs 7A and 17 agreed to: 

 

a) Recognize payables in the books with valid claims and sufficient 
documentary evidence to avoid administrative and/or criminal liability as 

a result for issuing a void certification; and 

 

b) Revert payables of those without existing valid claimants  
 

k. Unaccounted/unresolved SL balances 
 

Examination of the Inter-Agency Payable and Other Payable accounts of 

RRs 5 and 19 as at December 31, 2020 disclosed unaccounted balances totaling 

P0.581 million, as shown in Table 13. 

 
Table 13. Unaccounted Balances of Inter-Agency Payable and Other Payable

Total 290,289.55 580,782.01 871,071.56 

 

These unaccounted or unresolved balances had been discussed in previous 

years’ Management Letters for RRs 5 and 19, hence, an indication of the lack of 

reconciling and monitoring the  payables accounts.

103 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to revert these inter-

agency payables to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

 

 Compliance Issues 
 

Deficiencies in cash management 

 

3. Deficiencies and non-compliance with prescribed cash management mechanisms 
and controls related to cash-on-hand, cash items, collections, remittances, 

reporting, and safeguarding in several RRs exposed collections and funds to risk 

and resulted in losses. 
 

The BIR employs special and revenue officers for collecting payments for 

internal revenue taxes, including sale of documentary stamps and registration fees, and 

others. The cash and related transactions of the BIR also include numerous petty cash 

funds maintained by several custodians. Cash items, consisting of accountable forms 

with money value and others, are critical components of BIR’s operations. 

Cash is the most liquid asset of an agency and, therefore, so attractive that it is 

most susceptible to theft and misappropriation. To guard against the loss of cash 

through theft or fraud, adequate cash management mechanisms and controls must be in 

place.32 The prescribed procedures and controls for cash management consists of those 

pertaining to collection, remittance, reporting, and safeguarding. The responsibility of 

safeguarding cash ultimately rests with the head of the agency.33 

 

For so many years, the BIR had accumulated losses of cash due to shortages 

and unremitted collections.  For CY 2020, the cash examination and evaluation of 

related controls reveal several deviations from the promulgated procedures and 

controls, exposing the cash resources to loss or possible loss, as shown in Table 14.

In RR 8B, the SRCD for the period October to November 2019 were submitted 

only on September 15, 2020 or a delay of almost a year while the supporting documents 

were only submitted on December 2020 because the Order of Payments were misplaced 

by the AO. The late submission of SRCD and its supporting documents to the RFD 

caused the late recording of collections and deposits in the books totaling P70,225.35.  



105 

 

 

In RR 15, the 30 days delayed remittance of RDO 94 - Basilan pertains to the 

sale of DSTs where collections were lumped in one row in the Report of Collections 

and Deposits that covered the entire collection for the month. Hence, the actual date of 

sale of DSTs were not recorded or monitored daily. Collections from DSTs were 

deposited only when it reaches 1,000 pieces or P15,000.00 or at the end of the month.  

Also, there were instances where the RCOs already deposited their collections of 

checks but cash collections remained undeposited on the same time/day.  This condition 

was not discovered at the level of the RDO as the Collection Section’s monitoring of 

collections and remittances was done after the end of the month upon receipt of the 

reports from the RCOs.  The verification/review and monitoring were focused only on 

the total collections during the month and if the same were fully remitted during the 

period.  Its review/verification process does not include the details in handling 

collections and deposits. 

 

In RR 19, the designated Regional Cashier and the RCOs of RDO No. 113A, 

West-Davao, RDO No. 114, Davao Oriental and four RCOs of RDO No. 115, Davao 

del Sur did not deposit their collections daily or next banking day, which resulted in 

accumulation of sizeable amount of cash and checks in their custody.  The undeposited 

collection reached as high as P147.170 million and the cash holding period or lag days 

of deposits ranging from one to 13 CDs are indicative of lapses in observing the 

regulations which require that monies received should be remitted daily or on the next 

banking day. 

 

Also in RR 19, several disparities between total daily collections and the 

corresponding amount of deposit on the accounts and transactions of 20 RCOs were 

noted, which resulted in under/over deposit of collections of P0.01 to as high as P9.176 

million. 

 

These deficiencies in cash management exposed BIR’s cash and cash items to 

risk and, in fact, resulted in losses, which had accumulated to millions of pesos over 

the years.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) Regional Director in RR4 to instruct the RCO to (i) immediately deposit the 
outstanding unremitted collections worth P364,559.68; (ii) consider filing 

appropriate charges against the erring AO; and (iii) enforce stricter 

monitoring controls to prevent similar violations; 

 

b) RCOs in RRs 8B, 9A, 9B 15 and 19 to deposit intact all collections daily or not 
later than the next banking day; and (ii) respective Chiefs of Revenue 

Collection Section to monitor compliance therewith;  

 

c) Regional Cashier of RR 8B to submit the SRCD promptly to the RFD so that  
 



106 

 

d) collections will be timely recognized in the books;  
 

e) Require the RCOs of RDO 94 Basilan to include in their Report of Collection 
and Deposits the daily collections and deposits from sale of DSTs; and 

 

f) All concerned RCOs of RR 19 to (i) explain in writing the reason/s for the 
delayed remittance of the daily total collections with supporting documents; 

and (ii) issue the pre-numbered ORs in strict numerical sequence so that cash 

accountability and balances of unused accountable forms could be easily 

determined. 

 

Management comments: 

 

In RR 4, Management commented that on January 15, 2021, the concerned RCO 

made a partial remittance of P14,000.00. Management issued a memorandum ordering the 

withholding of his salaries and this was duly received by the RCO. The Chief of the RID 

then stated that a show cause order was being prepared for issuance, giving the RCO 10 

days upon receipt to explain why he should not be civilly/administratively, and criminally 

held liable. Although Management acknowledged that an act of non-remittance of the 

RCO’s collections may equate to grave misconduct and/or serious dishonesty, it explicitly 

stated that it gives due process to the former RCO before endorsing the matter to the BIR 

NO for the issuance of a final decision, in case the RCO does not respond and does not 

remit the remaining amount of P364,559.68.  

 

RR 19 explained that the delayed deposits occurred during the income tax deadlines 

due to the volume of taxpayers. It also attributed the deviations to the limited transits from 

the official station to the nearest city/municipality with AGDB, shortened operating hours 

by the banks during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) period and the various travel 

restrictions imposed by the national and local government.  

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

We agreed with management insofar as some collections happened during ECQ 

periods which affected the timely deposits thereof. However, it is also evident that some 

delays in deposits were incurred even in CY 2019 and early CY 2020 when the quarantine 

restrictions were not yet imposed. Likewise, the explanation from the erring RCOs with 

supporting documents to justify the delays and to attest to the limited operating hours in 

some branches of LBP were not yet submitted. 

 

 

Fidelity Bond of AOs  

 

4. A total of 28 AOs of RRs 3, 7A, 7B and 9B did not have fidelity bond coverage; the 
renewal of the fidelity bonds of AOS in RRs 3, 15 and 19 had been delayed; and 

some AOs were insufficiently bonded in RRs 9A and 19, which is not in accordance 

with Section 101 (2) of PD No. 1445 and Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated 



107 

 

August 06, 2009, to the detriment of the government in case of AOs’ defalcations, 

shortages and unrelieved losses.  

 

Every AO shall be properly bonded in accordance with law. Every officer of 

any government agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of 

government funds or property shall be accountable therefore and for the safekeeping 

thereof in conformity with law.34 

 

Every officer, agent, and employee of the Government of the Philippines or of 

the companies or corporations of which the majority of the stock is held by the National 

Government (NG), regardless of the status of their appointment shall, whenever the 

nature of the duties performed by such officer, agent or employee permits or requires 

the possession, custody or control of funds or properties for which he is accountable, 

be deemed a bondable officer and shall be bonded or bondable and his fidelity 

insured.35 

 

The Fidelity Fund shall be available for the purpose of replacing defalcations, 

shortages, unrelieved losses in the accounts of bonded public officers, for the payment 

of fees and costs incident to civil proceedings brought against them to recover sums 

paid on their account from said Fund.36     

 

AOs not bonded 

 

In RR 3, six personnel of the agency were already performing their duties and 

functions as RCOs without fidelity bond while in RR 9B, two newly designated RCOs 

who started collecting tax revenues for December 2020 were not secured by a fidelity 

bond.   

 

In RRs 7A and 7B, 20 out 54 AOs were not bonded. Interview with the 

concerned officials revealed that they are not aware that they are to be bonded.   

 

Delayed or non-renewal of fidelity bonds 

 

In RR 3, six personnel of the agency were already performing their duties and 

functions as RCOs without fidelity bond while in RR 9B, two newly designated RCOs 

who started collecting tax revenues for December 2020 were not secured by a fidelity 

bond.   

 

In RR 15, audit query disclosed that the fidelity bonds of all three AOs under 

RDO No. 93A were not renewed prior to the expiration as the personnel in-charge 

overlooked the processing of renewal of fidelity bonds due to the voluminous workload 

and paper works during the pandemic and implementation of COVID-19 health 

protocols 

                                                 
34 Section 101 (2) of PD No. 1445 
35 Section 4.1 of the General Provisions of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 
36 Section 4.8 of the General Provisions of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 



108 

 

 

In RR 19, 20 out of 30 AOs have expired fidelity bonds and renewal thereof 

were not done on time based on the confirmation letter from the Bureau of the Treasury 

(BTr). 

 

Insufficient bonds of AOs 

 

In RR 19, the fidelity bonds of 10 RCOs are inadequate to cover their maximum 

cash accountabilities with a variance ranging from P338,924.29 to P16.977 million, 

while in RR 9A, there were instances when collection exceeded the maximum bond 

accountability covered by the fidelity bond of the AO. 

 

The inability to apply for fidelity bond of the AOs, the delayed or non-renewal 

of the bonds and insufficient bond coverage have exposed the government to non-

indemnification in case of defalcations, shortages and losses to the government. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) RCOs of RRs 3, 7A, 7B and 9B to immediately secure fidelity bond insurance; 
and instruct the AHRMD to properly monitor the application; and 

 

b) RCOs in RRs 3, 15, 9A and 19 to initiate the renewal of fidelity bond at least 
one month prior to its expiration which should be adequate to cover the 

amount of their collections; and (ii) respective Revenue Districts Officers to 

monitor compliance therewith. 

 

 

Deficient SL Maintenance and Receivables Management 

 

5. The BIR’s inability to completely and properly accomplish and maintain the SLs 
as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs caused limitations in: (a) timely enforcement 

of the collection of receivables from debtors and recovery of accountabilities; (b) 

confirming validity of obligations of the debtors/AOs; and (c) monitoring and 

management of outstanding balances, resulting in the impairment and 

misstatement of the accounts and, eventually, loss of government resources. 

 

The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet 

the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information 

needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.37 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the BIR- NO - Collection Book’s (CB’s) relevant 

accounts consisted of 2,657 SLs, with total outstanding balance of P5.670 billion. The 

breakdown is shown in Table 15.

Examination of all the SLs and related receivables management procedure 

showed the following deficiencies: (a) Inadequate information in the SLs; and (b) Non-

issuance of demand letters for settlement of outstanding balances. 

 

Inadequate information in the SLs 

 

Appendix 06, Volume II, GAM for NGAs, prescribed in COA Circular No. 

2015-007, as amended, requires that the following information be indicated:38 

 

a. Entity Name – name of the agency/entity; 
b. Fund Cluster – the fund cluster name/code in accordance with the Unified 

Accounts Code Structure; 

c. Account of/Office/Address/Contact Person/Number – name, office address 
and contact number/e-mail address of the debtor/creditor (individuals, 

companies, agencies). In case of an agency/company, include the name, 

telephone number/e-mail address of the contact person; 

d. GL Account Code – GL account code prescribed in the RCA;  
e. SL Account Code – SL account code assigned by the agency/entity; 
f. Date – date of the source documents (i.e., JEV, OR, etc.); 
g. Particulars – other information or details pertaining to the transaction; 
h. Ref. – reference document such as the Statement of Account/JEV/OR/DV 

number, etc.; 

i. Debit Column – amount being debited to the account; 
j. Credit Column – amount being credited to the account; and 
k. Balance – the difference between the Debit and Credit columns. Place 

parentheses in the amount with a negative balance 

 

Examination of the SL accounts under the relevant accounts with accountability 

implications showed that at least 54 per cent of the SLs did not bear the complete names 

hindering proper identification of debtors, and the eventual demand/enforcement of 

settlement.  

 

For the account Other Receivables, there were even SL account names which 

cannot be readily verified, such as those shown in Table 16. 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
38 The requirement was present as early as CY 2002, in Appendix 07, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs

The required information for SL maintenance in Appendix 06, Volume II, GAM 

for NGAs is necessary for effective receivables/accountability management including: 

(i) proper service/issuance of demand letter when the receivables/ accountability 

becomes due and demandable; and (ii) confirmation of balances to ensure that the FSs 

amounts are not misstated. Absent the required SL relevant information, accountability 

monitoring and management would be problematic. 

 

Non-issuance of demand letter for settlement of outstanding balances 

 

It is the duty of the BIR Management to regularly monitor and analyze 

receivables and accountabilities to ensure that these are collected / settled when these 

becomes due and demandable to prevent loss and wastage of government resources.39 

The Accountant is responsible for: (i) periodic verification and validation of the 

existence of receivables / unsettled accountabilities; (ii) determination of debtors/AOs; 

and (iii) exhaustion of all remedies for settlement of outstanding balances, including 

but not limited to issuance of Demand Letters.40 

 

In its reply to Audit Query (AQ) Nos. 2020-001 dated November 11, 2020 and 

2021-002 dated January 19, 2021, requesting submission of the proof of exhaustion of

remedies for settlement of outstanding balances of Due from Officers and Employees 

and Other Receivables Accounts, respectively, the BIR was not able to provide proof 

that it issued the necessary Demand Letters for settlement to the persons/entities 

liable/accountable as of December 31, 2020. It only mentioned the issuance of Demand 

Letters for the 21 SL accounts under Other Receivables with total balance of P0.843 

million pertaining to Bank Penalties on Authorized Agent Banks. 

 

On January 18, 2021, a request was sent to the Personnel Division to provide 

employment status, current position, designation, office assignment and residential 

address of BIR personnel with unsettled balances under the Due from Officers and 

Employees account due to the deficiencies noted in the SLs of the BIR.  

 

The Personnel Division provided the list of BIR personnel with outstanding 

balances on March 04, 2021. However, verification of the list submitted by the 

Personnel Division shows that the (a) list consists of 766 BIR personnel, or 78 per cent 

of the 985 outstanding balances of BIR personnel in the Due from Officers and 

Employees; (b) out of 766 listed BIR personnel, 665 or 87 per cent did not have 

residential address information; (c) out of the 101 with address information, 25 

addresses were only up to municipal address, hence, proper service of Demand Letter 

is still not practicable.  In summary, only 76 BIR personnel have residential address for 

proper service of Demand Letters 

 

The non-issuance of timely Demand Letters and non-provision of 

debtors’/AO’s information as required in Appendix 06, Volume II of the GAM for 

NGAs precluded the Audit Team’s prompt issuance of Final Demand Letters and 

proper judicial remedies for collection of receivables and settlement of 

accountabilities.41 

 

The BIR’s inability to completely and properly accomplish and maintain the SL 

as prescribed in Section 111, PD No. 1445 and Appendix 6, Volume II of GAM for 

NGAs, caused limitations in (a) timely enforcing of the collection of receivables from 

debtors and recovery of accountabilities, resulting to impairment of the accounts and, 

eventually, loss of resources of the Government; (b) confirming validity and accuracy 

of obligations of the debtors; and (c) monitoring and management of outstanding 

balances, such as but not limited to, timely issuance of demand and confirmation letters. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, RAD to: 

 

a) Correct and update the SL information in eNGAS in compliance with 
Appendix 06, Volume II of GAM for NGAs, and henceforth comply with the 

requirements therewith; 

 

b) Issue Demand Letters for the settlement of outstanding balances to the 
debtors and AOs on the remaining 3,622 SL balances in the Due from Officers 

and Employees, and Other Receivables accounts; and 

                                                 
41 COA Memorandum No. 2017-010 



112 

 

 

c) Submit proof or copies of duly received/served Demand Letters for the 21 SLs 
on bank penalties totaling P0.843 million, and those which will be issued for 

the 3,622 remaining SLs. 

  

Management comments: 

 

The RAD informed that: (a) it has started updating the SL information of BIR 

employees in the eNGAS based on the list provided by Personnel Division; (b) Demand 

Letters will be issued to 17 employees in active status and to 274 former employees 

whose records are maintained in the Personnel Division; and (c) copies of the 21 

Demand Letters issued for Receivables from AABs were submitted. 

 

 

Adoption of Direct Contracting in the procurement of ICT Supplies  

 

6. Direct Contracting with Phil Repro-Com Products and Systems Inc. was resorted 
to as the mode of procurement of consumable toners/drums totaling P1.474 

million, when there are other authorized distributors/channels in the local market, 

thus, depriving RR 1 in getting better offers from other potential 

distributors/partners or who could offer the same items/specifications at a much 

lower price. 

 

Section 50 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides the definition of Direct 

Contracting: 

 

Direct Contracting or single source procurement is a method of 

procurement of Goods that does not require elaborate Bidding 

Documents. The supplier is simply asked to submit a price 

quotation or a pro-forma invoice together with the conditions of 

sale. The offer may be accepted immediately or after some 

negotiations. Direct contracting may be resorted to by concerned 

Procuring Entities under any of the following conditions: 

 

a. Procurement of Goods of proprietary nature which can be 
obtained only from the proprietary source, i.e. when patents, 

trade secrets, and copyrights prohibit others from 

manufacturing the same item;  

 

b. When the procurement of critical components from a specific 
supplier is a condition precedent to hold a contractor to 

guarantee its project performance, in accordance with the 

provisions of its contract; or  

 

c. Those sold by an exclusive dealer or manufacturer which 
does not have sub-dealers selling at lower prices and for 



113 

 

which no suitable substitute can be obtained at more 

advantageous terms to the Government of the Philippines. 

 

Post audit of approved Purchase Orders (POs) on the procurement of 

consumable toners/drums totaling P1.474 million disclosed that the Agency acquired 

these items from only one supplier, Phil Repro-Com Products and Systems Inc. The 

details of transactions are presented in Table 18.

Sub-Total       823,560.00 

Total       1,473,720.00 

 

Perusal of the supporting documents revealed that direct contracting was 

resorted based on the certificate of exclusive dealership issued by Fuji Xerox 

Philippines certifying that such consumables mentioned above are exclusively 

distributed by Phil Repro-Com Products and Systems Inc.  

 

The Auditor conducted verification to ascertain whether the assertions provided 

in the certificate is accurate. Browsing of the Fuji Xerox Philippines website42 disclosed 

that the company has a total of 25 authorized dealership or channel partners in the entire 

country. Eighteen of those dealerships are situated in Luzon, one of them is Phil Repro-

Com Products and Systems Inc. that claimed to be an exclusive dealer of Fuji Xerox 

Philippines.  

  

In order to justify the adoption of direct contracting, the Manual of Procedures 

for the Procurement of Goods requires the BAC to: 

 

1. Conduct a survey of the industry and determine the supply source in order to 
confirm the exclusivity of the source of goods to be procured. It must be 

conducted prior to the commencement of the procurement process; and 

 

2. The Procuring Entity must justify the necessity for an item that may only be 
procured through Direct Contracting, and it must be able to prove that there 

is no suitable substitute in the market that can be obtained at more 

advantageous terms. 

 

                                                 
42 (https://www.fujixerox.com.ph/en/Contact/Authorized-Resellers) 

https://www.fujixerox.com.ph/en/Contact/Authorized-Resellers


114 

 

In addition, the Notice of Direct Contacting and Request for Quotation were not 

posted by the BAC Secretariat in the PhilGEPS website, contrary to the manual of 

procedures which states, among others the following steps to be undertaken in 

conducting Direct Contracting: 

 

1. For information purposes, the BAC, through the BAC Secretariat shall post 
the notice of direct contracting in: (a) the PhilGEPS; (b) the website of the 

Procuring Entity and its electronic procurement service provider, if any; and 

(c) any conspicuous place in the premises of the Procuring Entity 

 

2. The BAC, through the Secretariat, posts for information purposes the 
Request for Quotation for a period of seven calendar days prior to sending 

the Request for Quotation, in: (a) the PhilGEPS; (b) the website of the 

Procuring Entity and its electronic procurement service provider, if any; and 

(c) any conspicuous place in the premises of the Procuring Entity 

 

In view of the foregoing, the BAC shall confirm the exclusivity of the source 

of the goods to be procured prior to the adoption of direct contracting as the mode of 

procurement. Mere presence of certificate of exclusive distributorship by one company 

will not immediately resort to Direct Contracting, as there may be other companies who 

can offer the same product specifications needed by the Agency.  

 

The reasonableness of taking Direct Contracting through exclusive 

distributorship deprived RR 1 in getting better offers from other potential 

distributors/partners or who could offer the same items/specifications at a much lower 

price. 

 

We recommended that the BAC strictly determine the existence of the 

requirements or conditions in Direct Contracting as stated in Section 50 of the 

IRR and the Manual of Procedures before using this mode of procurement. We 

also recommended that the BAC Secretariat post the notice of direct contracting 

and request for quotation in the PhilGEPS website as required in the manual.  

 

Management comments: 

 

The management argued that Phil Repro is offering a free lifetime service 

warranty on the condition that genuine consumables shall be used and purchased from 

them.  Thus, the procurement of consumables from Phil Repro is a condition precedent 

to guarantee the optimum performance of the photocopying machine, one of the 

conditions provided under Section 50b of Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

During the exit conference, the Auditor emphasized the requirements in the 

Manual of Procedures that the BAC is responsible to confirm the exclusivity of the 

source of goods to be procured and establish that there is no other available substitute 



115 

 

in the market that can be obtained at a more advantageous price/terms.  The Auditor 

also discussed the case of Pabillo v. COMELEC-GR No. 216098 which gave emphasis 

on the procedures to be followed by the BAC prior to the adoption of direct contracting 

as the mode of procurement. 

 

 

Delayed completion of building construction of RR 5 

 

7. The non-imposition by the RR 5 of the appropriate sanction to RC Ramos 
Construction Corporation for the construction of its regional office and RDOs 

25A and 25B buildings including site/land development works in the amount of 

P219.441 million  due to the slippage incurred in excess of the 10 per cent allowed 

had been disadvantageous to the Agency 
 

One of the primary considerations of the government for entering into a contract 

is the timely completion of the infrastructure project so that the intended benefits may 

be achieved. Consequently, the contracting parties are bound to adhere faithfully to the 

agreed terms and condition of the contract.  

 

Post audit of the undated DV No. 1012020040244 recorded per JEV No. 2020-

06-0539 dated June 1, 2020 in the amount of P54.860 million representing the claim of 

RC Ramos Construction Corporation for work accomplished for the period August 14, 

2019 to February 20, 2020 (3rd billing/payment) showed only 75.083 per cent work 

accomplishment, leaving a negative slippage of 24.917 per cent as of February 20, 

2020, the expiry date of the contract plus time extensions. 

 

Item III.A.2.b of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides the grounds for 

termination of contract.  Said grounds include that the procuring entity shall terminate 

a contract for default when any of the following conditions attend its implementation: 

 

b) Due to the Contractor’s fault and after the contract time has expired, it 

has incurred a negative slippage of ten percent (10%) in the completion of 

the work 

 

Also, Section 8.4 of Annex “E” of the IRR of the same RA provides that, in 

case that the delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration equivalent to 

10 percent of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the 

contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the 

contractor’s performance security and takeover the prosecution of the project or award 

the same to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract. 

 

Evaluation of the Status of Completion as of December 23, 2020, submitted by 

the Contractor and certified correct by Consultant A.C. Ong Consulting, Inc., showed 

an 87.47 per cent completion only, 10 months after the expiry date of the contract 

period of February 20, 2020 as agreed upon by the parties.  This completion rate 



116 

 

represents 77.70 per cent for the 11-storey building at Caloocan City and 100 per cent 

for the 2-storey building at Guiguinto, Bulacan.  

 

This accomplishment rate bolsters the fact that the Contractor has indeed 

exceeded the allowable time provided in RA No. 9184 to which, in this case, the RR 

could have either: 

 

a. rescind the contract;  
b. take over the project by administration, if capable; or 
c. award through negotiation to a qualified contractor. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to explain their inaction on the 

default of the Contractor in the completion of the project that could have 

protected the interest of the government. 

 

Management comments/actions taken: 

 

RR 5 Management vehemently denies that it was not able to impose sanction 

on RC Ramos Construction Corporation for its failure to finish the project last February 

20, 2020, the expiry date of the contract plus extension. 

 

The Management, after the expiration of the said contract had several official 

meetings with the President of RC Ramos Construction Corporation and the latter 

asked for reconsideration to finish the Caloocan project despite that its operation was 

being hampered by COVID restrictions.   

 

The contractor committed to finish the project and acknowledged that RR 5 will 

impose liquidated damages upon completion.  This commitment sways RR 5 to allow 

the completion of the project.   

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

As records would show, Management was not able to impose the necessary 

sanction to the contractor as authorized under RA No. 9184.  

 

 

Submission of mandatory reports and documents 

 

8. Financial reports, contracts, disbursement vouchers, and mandatory reports and 
documents were not submitted or submitted beyond the prescribed period, thus, 

affected the timely verification of financial accounts/transactions and 

communication of audit results to Management. 

 

One of the standards to achieve fair presentation and reliable information of FSs 

is timeliness in the preparation and submission of reports. All needed reports should be 

provided promptly to be of maximum usefulness.

9. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the BIR did not received funds specifically for COVID-19 

response and/or recovery.  However, the Bureau was able to identify the programs, 

projects and activities that would not push through during the year, hence, realigned 

the funds to cope-up/augment funds to finance COVID related health measures. 

 

The BIR NO spent a total of P4.041 million for the payment of Hazard Pay 

which was charged to PS and P2.716 million for MOOE, of which P1.213 million is 

charged to BIR specific budget for CY 2020 and P1.444 million was charged to 

eWallet43, as presented in Table 27.

On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item C, Section 4.0 of CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 18, s. 2020 states 

that reasonable transportation facilities and housing quarters shall be provided to 

employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever practicable, and subject to 

budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

The BIR-NO maximized the use of its official vehicles to transport the 

employees on skeletal workforce, hence incurred gasoline expense totaling 

P349,986.58. 

 

 

Grant of hazard pay to employees during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) 

 

10. RRs 7A and 7B had paid a total of P0.665 million and obligated a total of 
P115,500.00 in excess of the authorized hazard pay, while RR 6 had paid a total of 

P322,500.00 sans the Approved Skeleton Workforce (SWF) Schedule and Daily 

Time Records (DTRs), which is not in accordance with DBM Budget Circular No. 

2020-1 dated March 24, 2020.  
 

Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorizes the grant of 

Hazard Pay, to be called as COVID-19 Hazard Pay, to government employees and 

workers engaged through contract of service (COS) or job order (JO) basis who 

physically report for work during the implementation of the ECQ in their respective 

work stations, subject to guidelines and conditions which includes, but not limited to, 

the following44:  

 

a. Item 4.1 - The COVID-19 Hazard Pay to be granted shall not exceed 
P500.00/day per person, 

 

b. Item 4.2 - The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual 
positions, or are workers engaged through COS, JO, or other similar 

schemes, and 

 

c. Item 4.3 - The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically 
report for work at their respective offices or workstations on the prescribed 

official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of 

implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work station. 

 

Said benefit shall be granted to the aforementioned government employees and 

workers since they are inevitably exposed to health risks and hazards if they physically 

report for work during the period of an ECQ.45

45 Section 1, Item 1.2 DBM BC No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 



123 

 

Claims of hazard pay should be paid to employees who man the office during 

the implementation of the ECQ and Modified ECQ (MECQ)from March 17, 2020 to 

May 30, 2020, provided that they have been authorized to physically report for work at 

their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the 

head of agency/office. 

 

Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular (MC) 10, s. 2020 dated May 

7, 2020 with retroactive application starting March 16, 2020 provides, among others, 

the following: 

 

a. Item 3.2.b - The employees assigned as skeleton workforce, during ECQ 
shall be issued the necessary travel order/office orders, in addition to the 

office issued IDs for proper identification; and 

 

b. Item 3.2.e -The employees assigned as skeleton workforce shall be entitled 
to Hazard Pay on top of the Compensatory Time Off or Overtime Pay, as 

well as other applicable allowances, subject to accounting and auditing rules 

and regulations.  

 

Since BIR Offices in the NO and the RRs/RDOs throughout the country 

adopted a Work from Home Arrangement46. wherein employees shall no longer be 

required to report to the Office, except as necessary, the audit teams required the 

submission of the approved SWF Schedule and other supporting documents to ensure 

that employees who reported to work during ECQ and MECQ were properly 

authorized, thus, entitled to claim hazard pay. 

 

Review of the consolidated Statement of Financial Performance showed that 

the BIR had paid a total of P27.926 million Hazard Pay to regular/plantilla officials 

and employees who reported to office during the ECQ (March 17 to May 15, 2020) and 

MECQ (May 16 to 31, 2020).  The details are shown in Table 29.

Out of the 23 offices (NO and 22 RRs), three RRs were issued audit 

observations due to the (a) payment of Hazard Pay in excess of what was authorized; 

and (b) absence of approved SWF Schedule and DTRs, as discussed below:  

 

a. Excess payment of Hazard Pay 
 

Audit of the Hazard Pay account for CY 2020 disclosed that RRs 7A and 7B 

had paid and obligated P0.665 million and P115,500.00 or a total of P0.781 million in 

excess of the authorized hazard pay.  The excess was computed by comparing the 

number of days allowed/authorized based on the approved SWF schedule for the period 

March 17 to May 31, 2020 and the actual number of days claimed by employees and 

officers for the same period, as presented in Table 30.

Total 6,255 3,127,500.00 4,694 2,347,000.00 1,561 780,500.00 

 

Of the P177,500.00 excess payment to RR 7A employees, the amount of 

P61,000.00 was already refunded and recorded under JEV No. 2021-04-000547 dated 

April 1, 2021. 

 

b. No approved SWF Schedule and DTRs 
 

RRs 6 and 7B had paid hazard pay of P322,500.00 and P1.436 million, 

respectively, or a total of P1.759 million despite the absence of approved SWF.  

 

For RR 6, examination of the documents revealed that there is no approved SWF 

schedule that will allow the Audit Team to ascertain the validity of the Hazard Pay 

claims of the concerned offices. This approved SWF is of prime importance in 

determining that the employee was really allowed to report physically on the days he 

claimed for hazard pay.  

 



125 

 

Assuming that there is an approved SWF, audit of transactions revealed that not 

all Approved DTRs were submitted to COA despite requests from the RFD and 

AHRMD thru phone call, a letter dated February 16, 2021, and finally, a Demand Letter 

dated March 2, 2021.  Table 31 shows the summary of the number of claimants of 

hazard pay without DTRs for the period March 17 to May 15, 2020.

We recommended and Management of RR 6 agreed to: 

 

a) Submit the approved SWF;  
 

b) Require the refund of the amount of P322,500 which were paid despite the 
absence of DTRs; 

 

We also recommended and Management of RR 7A and 7B agreed to: 

 

c) Require the concerned personnel to refund the overpayment of hazard pay 
totalling P0.604 million within ten days from receipt of the AOM and 

immediately revert the excess amount of P115,500.00  recorded as Due to 

Officers and Employees. 

 

Management comments: 
 

RR 6 
 

Management thru the AHRMD had submitted on March 22, 2021 to COA Audit 

Team the DTRs pertaining to employees of the Bureau who received Hazard Pay 

subject to audit amounting to P322,500.00.  

 

For the requested SWF, since there was a declaration of the State of Public 

Health Emergency last March 2020 and a subsequent disruption in access to public 

transportation, working arrangements were then agreed internally by different divisions 

and district offices in order to accommodate the immediate needs and safety of the 

employees, and at the same time, to avoid delay in the delivery of public service, thus, 

no fixed schedule for SWF was created or approved for the Region.  Instead, the RFD 

and AHRMD used the actual and physical work attendance indicated in the employees’ 

DTRs as the basis for the computation of the payment for the Hazard Pay during the 

period of implementation of ECQ. 

 

 

 



126 

 

RR 7A 
 

To date, AHRMD had collected a total of P60,000.00 for the refund of 

overpayment. As at April 8, 2021 additional order of payment were forwarded to 

AHRMD for hazard overpayment made by four employees totaling P3,000.00. RFD is 

still waiting for the reply of one employee who had recently retired.  

 

The SWF Schedules of RDO 28 were already transmitted to the Office of the 

Regional Director for approval and the payrolls for the Hazard Pay are being corrected 

based on the said schedules. Approved SWF Schedule of RDO 40 were submitted to 

COA on February 22, 2021.  

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 
 

For RR 6  
 

We stand by our audit conclusion that the payment of Hazard Pay amounting to 

P322,500.00 was unauthorized in the absence of the Approved Skeleton Workforce 

Schedule for the period March 17 to May 15, 2020.   

 

We would like to emphasize one of the fundamental principles on government 

transactions that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation”.  Without the approved SWF, the COA Audit Team is precluded from 

ascertaining the validity and correctness of the claim.  Suffice it to say that audit 

procedures include the comparison of the days the person is authorized to report to 

work against the time he reported to work. 

 

Moreover, the absence of the approved SWF entitles all those authorized to 

report to work, to report at their own discretion, unmindful of the required limitation 

on the number of personnel who can be present in a room in accordance with the social 

distancing required by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF). 

 

 Lastly, Section 11.0 of DBM Circular 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 states: 

 

Agencies shall be responsible for the proper implementation of the 

provisions of this Circular.  The responsible officers shall be held liable 

for any payment not in accordance with the provisions hereof without 

prejudice to the refund by the employees concerned of any excess or 

unauthorized payments. 

 

RR 7A  
 

The Audit Team received a copy of Memorandum dated April 27, 2021 of the 

Regional Director to RDO 40 requiring for the immediate settlement of the excess 

payment of hazard pay. 

 

 

  



127 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

11. The Bureau was not able to carry out some of the planned GAD activities or 
maximize the use of its approved budget, thus the intended benefits of the plan 

were not fully achieved. Moreover, the non-submission of the GAD 

Accomplishment Report within the prescribed period, precluded the Audit Team 

from conducting timely evaluation and audit of GAD funds. 

 

All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address 

gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 

provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for 

Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the 

Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 

shall be at least five per cent of their budgets.  For this purpose, activities currently 

being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty 

alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human right, and practice of gender-responsive 

governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.47 

 

For CY 2020, the Philippine Commission for Women (PCW) had issued MC 

2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 relative to the submission of FY 2020 GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR). Among its salient features is Item 4.0 which states, 

“Considering that the GAD AR shall be consolidated by agency, the GAD expenditure 

of a regional office or a constituent unit may not necessarily reach five percent of its 

approved total annual budget for as long as the agency as a whole meets the minimum 

five percent GAD expenditure based on the agency’s total budget appropriations”. 

 

For CY 2020, the GAD accomplishment reports showed the number of fully 

accomplished, partially accomplished and not accomplished activities, as presented in 

Table 20.

On the other hand, although RRs 4, 10, 17 and 19 reported to have accomplished 

GAD activities, the same cannot be quantified as accomplished, partially 

accomplished, and not accomplished.  

 

Among the reasons cited for the partial and non-attainment of targets are: 

 

a) Poor planning and budgeting because it includes activities with allotted 
budget that do not commensurate to the actual expenditures; 

b) Due to the restrictions on the COVID 19 pandemic; and 
c) Lack of concrete programs and project for the particular GAD activities. 

  

Other deficiencies noted were as follows: 

 

a) Non- submission and/or late submission of the GAD Plan and Budget by RRs 
3, 5, 7A, and 7B, respectively; 

b) Non-submission of GAD Accomplishment Report by RR 3 contrary to the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 2014-001;  

c) GAD expenditures not included in the budget incurred by RRs 6, 8A and 8B; 
and 

d) Noted over-budgeting for petty expenditures. 
 

It was reported by some RRs that some activities were accomplished without 

spending the budgeted amounts as some activities were just reproduction of previous 

materials used. It was also reported that most of the trainings and orientations were 

conducted through virtual meetings which entailed less cost. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned GAD 

Focal Point System to: 

 

a) Ensure full implementation of all programs/projects/activities embodied in 
the GAD Plan with corresponding budget in order to achieve the desired goals 

and objectives of the Plan; and 

 

b) Submit the GAD Plan and Budget and the corresponding AR within the 
prescribed period.

Inaccurate billing and posting of GSIS remittances due to absence of access in the service 

records of employees 

 

16. The absence of access to the service records of the Authorized Agency Officer 
(AAO) and the delayed preparation and submission of the Agency Remittance 

Advice (ARA) by the latter to the GSIS resulted in the inaccurate: (a) billing of 

premiums due totaling P0.594 million for the new employees and those with salary 

increments, and (b) posting of remittances totaling P15,357.96, thus exposing the 

Agency to the risk of imposition of the corresponding interests, penalties and 

sanctions under RA No. 8291.  
 

Among the salient sections of RA No. 8291, (The GSIS Act of 1997) are the 

following: 
 

a. Section 5 (c) - It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all employers to 
include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations. Penal 



135 

 

sanctions shall be imposed upon employers who fail to include the payment 

of contributions in their annual appropriations or otherwise fail to remit the 

accurate/exact amount of contributions on time, or delay the remittance of 

premium contributions to the GSIS. The head of offices and agencies shall 

be administratively liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of 

premium contributions to the GSIS. (emphasis ours) 
 

b. Section 6 (a) - The employer shall report to the GSIS the names of all its 
employees, their corresponding employment status, positions, salaries, and 

such other pertinent information, including subsequent changes therein, if 

any, as may be required by the GSIS. 
 

c. Section 6 (b) - Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the 
employee’s and employer’s contributions within the first 10 days of the 

calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. 
 

d. Section 7 - Agencies which delay the remittance of any and all monies due 
to the GSIS shall be charged interest as may be prescribed by the Board but 

not less than two percent simple interest per month. Such interest shall be 

paid by the employers concerned. 

 

On the other hand, GSIS Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2012 was 

promulgated reiterating the procedures on updating membership records. Section 4 

thereof provides that all government agencies are mandated to submit the ARA and 

Electronic Remittance File (ERF) on the first week of every month.  The prompt 

submission of the ARA and ERF guarantees the accuracy of billing premiums due and 

posting of remittances in the GSIS database. The ARA indicates accurate information 

on GSIS member who have: 
 

a. been newly hired, re-employed, or reinstated (Form A); 
b. been transferred (Form B); 
c. obtained salary adjustments, increments (Form C); 
d. been separated from the service due to resignation, separation, retirement 

(Form D); and 

e. changes in their personal data (Form E). 
 

Meanwhile, the AAO is the official representative of a government agency who 

not only approves loans, but also serves as a partner of the GSIS in the timely 

submission of updated information of his agency and its employees. Among the 

qualificationof an  AAO are52: 
 

a. must have access to service records of employees of the agency; 
b. has access to the payroll data, specifically on the paying capacity of the 

employees of the agency; and 

c. has good working relationship with the ERF officers.

The Audit Team had already issued AOM Nos. 2019-001 (2018) and 2020-003-

(2019) dated February 13, 2019 and February 6, 2020, respectively, noting the delayed 

remittance to GSIS of the withheld premiums from salaries of employees. We 

recommended and Management agreed in both AOM to require the RFD to promptly 

remit to GSIS all premiums and other mandatory deductions withheld from employees 

within 10 days following the month when the deductions were made. 

 

However, our validation revealed that the Due to GSIS year-end balance 

increased by 360.02 per cent from CY 2018 to CY 2019 and by 544.25 per cent from 

CY 2018 to CY 2020. This was despite the split of the previous RR 8 Makati City into 

2, namely RR 8A-Makati City and RR 8B-South NCR.  

    

As at December 31, 2020, the Agency reported a balance of P2.144 million. 

Verification revealed that this was attributed to the premiums withheld from the 

employees’ salaries (whether regular, newly-hired, newly promoted and those claiming 

thru DVs due to leave without pay) and loan repayments. From the unremitted balance 

as at January 2020 of P1.531 million, the amount increased to P2.144 million or 40 per 

cent.  

 

Undeniably, for CY 2020, the delayed/non-remittance of these premiums were 

aggravated by the current pandemic wherein alternative work arrangements were 

adopted by government agencies. Even so, the Agency Head thru the concerned office/s 

are enjoined to ensure compliance on the updating and remittance procedures of the 

premiums and other mandatory deductions due to the GSIS. 

 

Absence of access to employees’ service records 

 

Our audit disclosed that the absence of access in the service records by the AAO 

and the delayed preparation of the appropriate ARA Form by the latter resulted in the 

inaccurate: (a) billing of premiums due for newly-hired employees and those with 

salary increments totaling P0.594 million; and (b) posting of remittances for employees 

billed by the GSIS and paid by the Agency totaling P15,357.96.   

 

As stated above, the AAO shall have full access to the service records of 

employees of the agency as well as the payroll data, specifically on the paying capacity 

of the employees of the agency, among others. For the BIR, these functions are 

basically entrusted to the Human Resource Management Section (HRMS) as they are 

the Agency’s repository of personnel information as contained in the service record. 

 

Our interview with the Chief, RFD revealed that at present she is the Agency’s 

AAO.  This is not in consonance with the qualification of an AAO.   This even adds up 

to the responsibilities and functions of the Finance Officer who is tasked to provide 

functional direction to budgeting and accounting and account for the disbursement and 

cash allocations incurred by the Bureau. 

 



137 

 

Moreover, the Chief RFD has no access to the service records of the agency. 

Consequently, she would only rely from the information given to her by the personnel 

in charge at the HRMS upon request. Had the role of AAO been designated to the 

qualified personnel/officer in the HRMS who has access to the service records of the 

Agency, prompt updating of members’ information and accurate billing of premiums 

due in the GSIS database could have been guaranteed.  

 

Delayed/Non-preparation of ARA resulted in unremitted premiums of newly-hired 

employees and those with salary increments  

 

A total of P0.594 million premium remained unremitted to the GSIS as at 

December 31, 2020.  This pertained to withheld premiums for the initial and succeeding 

salaries of 133 newly-hired employees totaling P0.544 million and withheld premiums 

relating to salary increments of seven employees totaling P49,465.81.  

 

Verification revealed that the unremitted balances pertain to premiums withheld 

without billings yet from the GSIS from the time the deductions were effected, thus, 

unremitted. Indisputably, the condition existed as there were noted delays in the 

inclusion of these employees in the GSIS billing file. The Audit Team compared the 

GSIS billing files obtained from the RFD against the date of entry of newly-hired 

employees for the current year and noticed that it would take four months from the date 

of entry in the Agency before the latter could be included therein. Also, we have noted 

in the samples obtained, that it would take four to seven months from the date of 

promotion before the new salary rate could be updated in the GSIS billing file. 

 

In one of our phone interviews with the personnel in charge in the GSIS AMD, 

NCR Department II, we have noted that in one instance, one employee who have been 

hired on November 22, 2019 was only reported to them using ARA Form A on March 

9, 2020, approximately four months from entry to office. 

 

The delayed preparation and submission to the GSIS of the appropriate ARA 

Form by the AAO precludes the Agency from obtaining accurate billing of premiums 

from the former thereby impeding its prompt remittance. Moreover, the delays in 

remittances could expose the Agency to the risk of imposition of the corresponding 

interests, penalties and sanctions provided under RA No. 8291.  

 

Premiums not withheld but remitted to the GSIS for the accounts of employees deleted 

in the General Payroll  

 

As a control measure, the Agency deletes employees who have incurred leave 

without pay (LWOP) in the payroll, who thereafter claim their salaries thru DVs. Our 

examination revealed that the Agency still paid the premiums totaling P15,357.96 

billed by the GSIS, despite the absence of withholding from salaries from three 

employees because they were deleted from the General Payroll due to LWOP.  

 



138 

 

In addition, our inquiry with the HRMS revealed that one of the employees, 

died in CY 2020 but premiums attributed to him were paid by the Agency, thus 

resulting in the negative balance and a receivable of the Agency from the deceased 

employee.  

 

Had the AAO or concerned employee prepares and promptly submits the 

appropriate ARA Form to the GSIS for the employees who have no remittances of 

premium for certain number of consecutive months, these employees could have been 

excluded from the GSIS billing file for the period concerned, hence, inaccurate 

payments made to the GSIS could have been prevented. 

 

The non-remittance or delayed remittance of these premiums and loan 

amortizations deprived the  government of its much needed revenues and fund sources 

and exposed the employees to the risk of non-availment of the privileges and benefits 

due them. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) Designate the AAO, a qualified officer/employee from the HRMS who has 
access to the service records of employees of the Agency; 

 

b) Require the designated AAO to promptly create and update members’ 
profile/records in the GSIS database by preparing and submitting to the 

latter the appropriate ARA Form within the first week of every month; 

 

c) Require the ERF Officer to validate and immediately remit to the GSIS the 
unremitted premiums related to the initial and succeeding salaries of newly-

hired employees totaling P0.544 million, and the unremitted premiums for 

salary increments of employees/officers totaling P49,465.81;  

 

d) Thereafter, promptly remit to the GSIS all unremitted premiums withheld 
within 10 days of the calendar month following the month to which the 

contributions apply; and 

 

e) Require the RFD to immediately demand the refund for the overpayment of 
employees’ share in the Life and Retirement Premiums amounting to 

P15,357.96.  

 

Management comments: 

 

According to the Management, the Region is currently updating the Agency 

Information Sheet (AIS) with the Chief, HRMS, AHRMD as the AAO, for submission 

to the GSIS. To date, all submitted ARA Forms to GSIS are coordinated with the 

Finance Division. The Chief, HRMS has designated one HR Staff who will promptly 

create and update members’ profile/records in the GSIS database through the ARA.  

 



139 

 

On the other hand, the RFD is in the process of reconciling the summarized 

vouchers of employees against the Schedule of Unpaid Premiums from the GSIS 

Electronic Billing and Collection System and will review the withheld and remitted 

amounts in the period mentioned and will take effect any adjustment that will be noted.  

 

 

Unauthorized GSIS RLIP remittance 

 

17. In RR 16, the government share in the Retirement and Life Insurance Premium 
(RLIP) amounting to P1.723 million for the month of April 2020 was disbursed 

and remitted to GSIS on April 22, 2020 even without the required Obligational 

Request and Status (ORS), contrary to DBM Circular Letter No. 2020-6 dated 

dated March 30, 2020. 

 

As a result of the existence of a National Emergency arising from the COVID-

19, the GSIS through the DOF, requested the timely remittance of the government 

share in premium contribution to ensure that any benefit pay-outs required by its 

member are fully provided.53  Relative thereto, to streamline the flow of funds, the 

following shall be observed effective April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020: 

 

1. While the full year requirement of the government share in the RLIP have 
been released comprehensively under General Allotment Release Order 

(GARO) No. 2020-1 dated January 6, 2020, all concerned 

departments/agencies are advised that the amounts covering the 12 per cent 

government share in premium contribution for the period April to December 

2020, are hereby withdrawn effective immediately. Accordingly, the 

negative GARO shall be issued for the purpose covering the 2nd to 4th quarters 

funding requirement of the government share.54 

 

2. Starting April 2020, the DBM shall directly remit to the GSIS the 
government share in the RLIP contribution for all departments, bureaus and 

offices of the national government.  xxx 

 

In the audit of RR 16’s appropriations, allotments and utilization for the 1st 

semester of CY 2020, the Audit Team noted the existence of negative amount for 

RLIP.  Verification revealed that the government share in the RLIP for March and 

April 2020 were lumped in DV No. 2020-04-0729 with ADA No. 1010412520 dated 

April 22, 2020.   

 

The DBM Circular Letter was released on March 30, 2020, hence, the Agency 

should have known that remittance for government share in RLIP for April 2020 

onwards would be directly remitted by DBM and not by the Agency.  

 

                                                 
53 Section 3.0, DBM Circular Letter 2020-6 dated March 30, 2020 
54 Item 4.1, Section 3.0, DBM Circular Letter No. 2020-6  



140 

 

Upon inquiry, the Budget Officer revealed that there was no allotment received 

to obligate the same contributions for the month of April 2020.  RR 16 referred this 

matter to the DBM thru a letter dated May 6, 2020 requesting for Allotment Advice 

for RLIP contributions for the month of April 2020. 

 

On January 12, 2021, the Management informed that GSIS certified that the 

said remitted amount had been posted to the individual member’s accounts. Also, 

GSIS affirmed that double posting is not possible in their system.  However, per 

clarification made on January 11, 2021 with RR 16 in-charge for remittances, the 

GSIS and DBM has yet to reconcile their records to determine if double payment had 

really transpired before the excess payment will be returned to the latter. Both 

agencies are just waiting for the December 2020 remittance to start the reconciliation 

of the April 2020-December 2020 remittances.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

  

a) Require the RFD to be more cautious in the disbursement of government 
funds by ensuring compliance with relevant DBM Circulars and other 

government issuances; and  

 

b) Follow-up with the DBM and GSIS on the status of the government share 
for RLIP. 

 

 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 

 

18. The Bureau’s properties were inadequately insured (RRs 7A and 7B) or not 
insured (RRs 10 and 18) while RRs 6, 7B and 8A had not conducted an appraisal 

of their properties or considered that there had been acquisitions, improvements 

impairments and disposals of the properties, hence, the possibility that the 

insurance coverage may be insufficient or maybe more than what is required.  

Likewise, the correctness/accuracy of the assessed value of the insured subject 

property of RRs 6, 7A and 8A cannot be ascertained due to non-preparation of 

Property Inventory Form (PIF). 

 

RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by 

PD No. 245, requires all property of the government, including government-owned or 

controlled corporations to be insured with the Property Insurance Fund administered 

by the GSIS.55 

 

Complementary to the Act, COA Circular 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 was 

issued requiring the submission of the PIF56 as the basis for the assessment of general 

insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and interests of the government. 

                                                 
55 Section 1, COA Circular No. 2018-002 
56 A list of all the insurable properties and other assets of the agency showing the assets latest appraised 

values/valuation, appraisal date, location, and other information. 



141 

 

The same Circular requires all Heads of the government agencies to direct the pertinent 

official under his/her supervision to, among others: 

 

a) Extract from the RPCPPE, as well as from the RPCI, the data for the PIF 
pertaining to the insurable assets and interest of the government (excluding 

impaired properties for disposal);  

b) Cause the appraisal of the insurable properties and other assets; and 
c) Submit the PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Audit Team Leader and the GIF, 

GSIS, not later than April 30 of each year.57 

 

On a positive note, it is noteworthy to mention that RRs 1, 2, 3, 4, 9A, 9B, 

11, 12, 15, 16 and 17 were reported to have insured their insurable properties.   

 

Non-insurance of insurable properties  

 

However, the insurable properties of RRs 10 and 18, amounting to P20.291 

million and P129.026 million, respectively were not insured with the General 

Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS, while the insurance coverage of government 

properties of RRs 7A and 7B were inadequate since only the motor vehicles, buildings 

of RR 7A and RDO 41 of RR 7B were insured, thus, the risk of non-indemnification 

in case of loss of assets.  

 

On the other hand, the activities shown in Table 26 were not undertaken by 

the concerned regions, contrary to the abovementioned regulations: 

 
Table 26. Activities not Undertaken by RRs 

RRs Conduct of Appraisal of Properties Submission of PIF 

6 x x 

7A  x 

7B x  

8A x x 

 

In RR 6, the Audit Team noted the non-conduct of appraisal of its properties 

and that the latest available RPCPPE and Inventory of semi-expendable properties 

were used as basis in the determination of insurance coverage, instead of the required 

PIF. This practice is misleading as the amount reflected in the said reports were only 

the acquisition cost and not the appraisal value.  

 

In the case of RRs 7A and 7B the conduct of an appraisal was not done due 

to unresolved issues on the splitting of the properties assigned in different divisions. 

This means that the Regions had not considered that there had been acquisitions, 

improvements, impairments and disposals of the properties.  Hence, the possibility 

that the insurance coverage may be insufficient or maybe more than what is required. 

Insufficient insurance coverage exposed the Bureau to inadequate or unreliable 

protection against any damage to or loss of its properties while over coverage exposed 

the Bureau to unnecessary additional expense. 

                                                 
57Section 5.1.e, Ibid. 



142 

 

Non-submission of the PIF 

 

RRs 7A and 7B reasoned out the non-submission of PIF is also due to the 

unresolved issue on segregation/transfer of properties.  

 

We understand that the custody/ownership of some properties cannot still be 

determined.  However, the properties in RDOs 41, 42, 43, 45 and 46 of RR 7B can 

already be identified, hence, the PIF should have been prepared by the AHRMD 

based on the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2019 and should have caused the insurance 

of these properties.  

 

We emphasized that the absence of PIF precludes the Audit Team in 

ascertaining the adequacy of the insurance coverage. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that: 

 

a) RRs 8 and 10 immediately insure its properties with the GIF of GSIS by 
submitting an updated inventory of all insurable properties to the GSIS 

using the prescribed PIF; and  

 

b) RRs 6, 7A, 7B and 8A instruct the AHRMD to cause the appraisal of their 
properties and come up with an updated list of insurable properties to be 

reported in the PIF. 

 

 

19. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
  

For CY 2020, Notices of Suspension (NSs) and Disallowance (NDs) issued 

by the Audit Teams amounted to P5.741 million and P318.572 million, respectively, 

while there were no Notices of Charge issued. Notice of Settlement of Suspension/ 

Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) issued during the year for settlement of NSs and NDs 

amounted to P10.945 million. The details of the audit suspensions, disallowances, 

and charges as at December 31, 2020, are shown in Table 32.
