EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
A. Introduction 

 

The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is the sole body that 

exercises jurisdiction over the supervision, adjudication and control over all 

telecommunications services throughout the country. As such, it adopts and 

promulgates guidelines, rules, and regulations relative to the establishment, operation 

and maintenance of various telecommunication facilities and services nationwide. 

 

The NTC was created by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 546 dated July 

23, 1979 as an agency under the Department of Transportation and Communications 

(DOTC). Said EO conferred the NTC with the regulatory and quasi-judicial functions 

taken from the abolished Board of Communications and the Telecommunications 

Control Bureau. EO No. 269 dated January 12, 2004 transferred the supervision and 

control of the NTC from the DOTC to the Commission on Information and 

Communications Technology (CICT). On August 16, 2005, EO No. 454 was issued 

and NTC was transferred back to the supervision and control of the DOTC. On August 

6, 2007, EO No. 648 entitled “Attaching the NTC from the DOTC to the CICT” 

directed that the supervision and control of the NTC be transferred again to the CICT. 

On June 23, 2011, by virtue of EO No. 47, the CICT was renamed the Information and 

Communications Technology Office (ICTO) and was placed under the policy, 

technical and administrative supervision of the Department of Science and 

Technology (DOST), while NTC was among the agencies retained under the Office 

of the President. 

 

On May 23, 2016, Republic Act (RA) No. 10844 created the Department of 

Information and Communications Technology (DICT). By virtue of this Act, the NTC 

became an attached agency of the newly created executive department for policy and 

program coordination. 

 

The total personnel complement of the NTC consists of 381 permanent 

employees, 12 Presidential appointees, 39 Co-terminus with the official being served, 

43 Co-terminus with incumbent and hired 112 job orders under contract of service.

C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the NTC for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may 

be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunity and (c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the 

extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations and, (d) determine the extent 

of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the NTC as at 

December 31, 2020 for the misstatements in assets, liabilities and net asset/equity accounts 

in the amount of ₱70,794,227.99, ₱52,677.95 and ₱65,603,823.78 which represent 1.76 

percent, 0.13 percent and 1.64 percent of its total Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity, 

respectively. Moreover, due to the significant impact of such misstatements on the reported 

balances of the affected accounts, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, existence, 

classification, rights and obligations, and valuation of the said accounts could not be relied 

upon. 

 

 

 

 



iii  

E. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The other significant observations and recommendations, discussed in details in Part 

II of the report are as follows: 

 

1. The validity and accuracy of Accounts Receivable amounting to ₱3,256,040,422.44 as at 
December 31, 2020, cannot be relied upon due to the discrepancy amounting to 

₱86,698,015.01 between the balances per Accounting books and Service Units’ records 

brought about by the lack of efficient and effective system of assessment, billing, 

collection and recording of receivables. Moreover, Management failed to assess the 

collectability of the long outstanding receivables and provide allowance for impairment 

thereof, thus, contributing to the non-reliability of the account balance.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. devise well-defined processes that will ensure an efficient system of billing and 
issuance of order of payment as well as the related processes of assessment of 

fees, collections, issuance of licenses and permits, and maintenance of records 

therefor, and consider the computerization of said processes that will allow the 

smooth flow of transactions from both NTC Central Office and Regional 

Offices;  

 

b. require the Accounting Unit and the Service Units to investigate the noted 
variances between their records and effect corrections accordingly, based on 

proper documentation; 
 

c. issue guidelines/policy on the assessment of collectability of receivables through 
the evaluation of relevant factors and determine the amount of allowance for 

impairment to be provided for the agency’s accounts receivables and furnish 

such information to the Accountant; and  

 

d. require the Accounting Unit, Service Units and other concerned officials to 
assess the collectability of the agency’s accounts receivables based on the issued 

guidelines and record in the books the allowance for impairment. 

 

2. The balance of fund transfers to DBM - Procurement Service and Department of Science 
and Technology – Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) amounting 

to ₱3,726,198.29 and ₱25,568,000.00, respectively, recorded under the account Due from 

NGAs, remained unliquidated, despite completion of the agreed undertaking; submission 

of duly supported terminal report by the implementing agency and/or completion of the 

project timeline, contrary to the Memorandum of Agreement of the parties and COA 

Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994.  
 

 

 

 



iv  

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. RO X to coordinate with the NTC-CO for the status of the balance of fund 
transfer to DBM-PS and demand the refund of the unexpended balance;  

 

b. The Accountant of RO I to record the liquidation of the fund transfer to DOST-
ASTI with the terminal report and supporting document as basis;  

 

c. RO XII to monitor and demand from the DOST-ASTI the RCI and RD to report 
on the utilization of the funds transferred and return the unused balance, if any, 

and demand completion of the project; and 

 

d. The implementing agencies to render/submit an accounting/liquidation of 
expenses as soon as the projects are completed pursuant to the above-cited 

regulations. 
 

3. The balances of Inventory accounts were unreliable due to the discrepancy between the 
Accounting and Supply records amounting to ₱3,752,262.11 caused by, among others, 

the failure to conduct physical inventory by the Inventory Committee, delayed or non-

submission of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) by the Supply Division, 

and non-maintenance of Supply Ledger Cards (SLC)  by the Accounting Unit and Stock 

Cards (SC), Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) and Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) by 

the Supply Division for monitoring. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. The Inventory Committee to conduct physical count of all the agency’s 
Inventories semi-annually and prepare the RPCI as basis in the conduct of 

regular reconciliation; 

 

b. Both the Supply Division and the Accounting Unit to check/investigate the noted 
variances between the recorded Inventories per books of accounts and RPCI 

and effect corrections on their records, as necessary, supported with complete 

documentation; 

  

c. The Supply Division to: 
 

i. Prepare RSMI, RIS and ICS; 
ii. Regularly submit RSMI to AU; and 

iii. Update the SC for all Inventory items; 
 

d. The Accounting Unit to: 
 

i. Maintain and update the SLC for all Inventory items; and 



v  

ii. Effect the necessary journal entries to effect adjustments based on the 
reconciliation supported with adequate documents and record issuances 

of inventories based on RSMIs; and 

 

e. Through the Human Resource Division, to review the functions, systems and 
procedures, organizational structure and staffing in order to determine the 

appropriate human resource complement for their activities, pursuant to 

Section 11.4 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2018 dated November 

9, 2018, especially in the Accounting Department and the GSD.  

 

4. The existence and valuation of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts could 
not be ascertained due to unreconciled discrepancy between the balance per books and 

the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) amounting 

to ₱78,033,876.92, caused by, among others, the failure to conduct physical count of PPE 

by the Inventory Committee and the non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) by 

the Accounting Unit and Property Card (PC) and Property Acknowledgement Receipt 

(PAR) by the Property Division for monitoring and as basis for reconciliation.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. The respective Inventory Committees to conduct physical count of all the 
agency’s PPE periodically and prepare the RPCPPE based on physical count to 

serve as basis of regular reconciliation; 

 

b. The Property Division and the Accounting Unit to: 
 

i. Check/investigate the noted variances between the recorded PPE per 
books of accounts and property records/RPCPPE and adjust both 

records, as necessary, based on proper documentation; 

 

ii. Conduct regular reconciliation of their records and as much as possible 
reconciliation must be undertaken while physical count is in progress in 

order to settle immediately the discrepancy in both records; and 

 

iii. Determine the fair value of the unrecorded equipment found at the 
station; 

 

c. The Property Division to: 
 

i. Renew all the PARs to update all records of accountability for PPEs and 
update the PC for all PPE items; 

 

ii. Properly label items of PPE and periodically check and replace such labels 
whenever the need arises; and 

 



vi  

iii. Timely evaluate the conditions of the PPE items and properly segregate 
as to serviceable and unserviceable and plan a disposal scheme for the 

unserviceable items; 

 

d. The Accounting Unit to: 
 

i. Maintain and update the PPELC for all PPE items; and 
 

ii. Effect necessary adjustments in the books of accounts supported by 
adequate supporting documents as basis;  

 

e. The concerned Accountable Office to immediately prepare the Report of Lost, 
Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) and other necessary 

documents that will serve as notification to the Accounting Unit for recording;  

 

f. The Disposal Committee to facilitate its disposal within the soonest possible time 
to prevent further deterioration and to generate income from sale, if any; and 

 

g. Through the Human Resource Division, to review the functions, systems and 
procedures, organizational structure and staffing in order to determine the 

appropriate human resource complement for their activities, pursuant to 

Section 11.4 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2018 dated November 

9, 2018, especially in the Accounting Department and GSD. 

 

5. Cash Advances granted to officers and employees of NTC Central Office to defray 
various expenses amounting to ₱3,048,725.77 remained unliquidated as at December 31, 

2020, despite the purpose for which it was given has been served.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to enforce strictly the immediate 

liquidation of cash advances as soon as the purpose for which they were  granted 

have been served or within the prescribed period pursuant to the above laws, rules 

and regulations and for proper recognition of expenses and settlement of cash 

advances.  

 

6. Weaknesses in the internal control system of the NTC-National Capital Region 
pertaining to the assessment, collection and deposit, and recording of revenues such that 

tampering of Official Receipts went undetected, thus, resulting in a cash shortage of at 

least ₱470,000.00 and affecting the reliability of the recorded revenue for CY 2020.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Include the Accounting Unit (AU), as approving officer of the Order of Payment 
(OP), in the enhancement and augmentation of the Database Management and 

Licensing System application; 

 



vii  

b. Require the AU to prepare Subsidiary Ledgers and schedules, and to properly 
monitor the revenue accounts; 

 

c. Assign/Designate a Unit Head of the Cash Unit to review the reports prepared 
by the Collecting Officer before submitting to the AU; 

 

d. Investigate further the extent of the tampering done by the Collecting Officer 
and file appropriate charges, if necessary, as soon as possible; and 

 

e. Review the processes and install strong internal control measures to prevent a 
similar occurrences in the future. 

 

7. Lapsed Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) in ROs VIII and IX in the amount of 
₱15,134,485.48 and ₱4,979,032.29, respectively, were reverted to the National Treasury 

as at December 31, 2020, as a result of improper planning and forecasting, thus, affecting 

the optimal fund utilization and the timely implementation of the projects/programs/ 

activities of the agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Formulate realistic and attainable work plan in the Annual Work Program to 
ensure that projects/procurements are ready for implementation upon receipt 

of cash allocations; 

 

b. Require the concerned officials to indicate in the Annual Procurement Plan the 
schedule of procurement/implementation of the project in order to achieve 

proper timing of procurement and to avoid time limitations in the conduct of the 

procurement activity; and 

 

For RO VIII 

 

c. Avail of the EPA, as authorized in Section 19 of RA 11465, GAA of FY 2020, 
with guidelines set forth under GPPB Circular No. 06-2019, to ensure the timely 

delivery of goods; and henceforth, coordinate with the BAC of NTC RO III to 

undertake the procurement of the goods, and with the Department of Science 

and Technology (DOST) in order to operationalize the project. 

 

F. Enforcement of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

The total audit suspensions, disallowances and charges found in the audit of various
