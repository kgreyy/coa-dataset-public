PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Financial Audit 
 

Accounting errors/omissions 

 

1. Various accounts of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) 
have misstatements resulting in aggregate errors on the reported total Assets, 

Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity by ₱70,794,227.99, ₱52,677.95 and ₱65,603,823.78 

which represent 1.76 percent, 0.13 percent and 1.64 percent of its total Assets, 

Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity, respectively. Moreover, due to the significant 

impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, 

Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, existence, classification, rights and 

obligations, and valuation of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1, 
Presentation of Financial Statements, describes financial statements as structured 

representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity. The standard 

further states that the objectives of general purpose financial statements are to provide 

information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity 

that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions about the 

allocation of resources. Specifically, the objectives of general purpose financial reporting 

in the public sector should be to provide information useful for decision making, and to 

demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it. 

 

3. Paragraph 27 thereof provides that financial statements shall present fairly the 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with additional 

disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair 

presentation. 

 

4. When an audited entity presents its financial statements (FS), it is implicitly making 
assertions that certain conditions have been fulfilled in the accounts, among others, which 

are as follows: 

Assertion Condition 

Completeness All transactions and events that should be recorded have been recorded 

Accuracy All transactions and events were recorded without error; all information disclosed is in 
the correct amounts, and which reflect their proper values 

Cut-off All transactions and events were recorded within the correct reporting period 

Classification All transactions have been recorded in the proper accounts; assets, liabilities and 
equity interests have been recorded in the proper accounts 

Existence All account balances exist for assets, liabilities, and equity 



45 

 

 

5. The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of FS rests with the 
Management of the reporting entity, particularly the Head of Finance/Accounting Office, 

and the head of entity or his authorized representative, as provided in the Philippine 

Application Guidance (PAG) 4 on IPSAS I and Section 4, Chapter 19 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

 

6. Management requires information to make effective decisions. However, 
information alone is not enough; it must be the right information, in an understandable 

format, which is timely enough to be useful. The prompt recording and proper classification 

of transactions and events are preconditions for reliable and relevant information. 

 

7. The GAM provides the accounting standards, policies and guidelines in accounting 
for government funds and property and the list of accounts for use of national government 

agencies as well as the description for each account. 

 

8. Our audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions resulting in misstatements 
in account balances reported in the consolidated FS of the NTC, as summarized in Table

10. The foregoing errors and omissions in recording and reporting of financial 
transactions were due to the following:  

 

a. Delayed or non-submission of reports by concerned offices/process owners 
to the Accounting Unit (AU). 

b. Lack of regular reconciliation and coordination between the concerned 
offices/process owners and the AU. 



49 

 

c. Lack of awareness on the policies and guidelines on the recording of 
accounts/transactions provided in the GAM. 

d. Lack of necessary documents to support the adjusting entries. 
 

11. The failure of the Accountants to observe due care in keeping of the accounts and 
the lack of coordination with concerned offices/process owners resulted in delayed and 

inaccurate recording of transactions which affected the fair presentation of the accounts in 

the FS . 

 

12. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  
 

a. the concerned Accounting Unit (AU) to draw journal entry vouchers 
(JEVs) to correct all the noted accounting errors and omissions; and 

henceforth, observe the proper recording, adjustments and 

reclassifications of accounts and transactions which should be supported 

with necessary documentations in accordance with the GAM and other 

existing accounting rules and regulations; and 

 

b. the concerned offices/process owners to coordinate and timely submit 
reports to their respective AUs to support the recording of transactions 

and conduct regular reconciliation therefor, in accordance with existing 

accounting rules and regulations. 
 

Management Comments: 

 
13. NTC-CO Management admitted that there are PPEs transferred to ROs but not yet 
recorded in the books because the transfer documents were not yet received by the Finance 

Division. 
 
14. NCR Management commented that six (6) of the unrecorded Motor Vehicles are 
not yet properly turned over by the NTC-CO, hence, not yet recorded by the AU in the 

books.  

 

15. In RO V, Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) Nos. 01-2020-02-0049 dated February 17, 
2021 and 01-2021-03-0077 dated March 4, 2021, were prepared to reclassify and correct 

the balances of the accounts. 

 

16. RO XI informed the Audit Team that they already made the necessary adjusting 
entries in the books as of December 31, 2020, but there was no copy of the JEV recording 

the said adjusting entries attached in the reply or submitted/furnished during and after the 

exit conference. 

 

17. All concerned ROs commented that they will make the necessary adjustments and 
will submit the documents to their respective Audit Teams.  

 



50 

 

18. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements of ₱70,794,227.99, ₱52,677.95 and ₱65,603,823.78 which represent 1.76 

percent, 0.13 percent and 1.64 percent of the total Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity, 

respectively,  we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial statements of the NTC as 

at year-end. 

 

Accounting deficiencies 

 

19. Various accounting deficiencies were noted in recording and reporting 
financial transactions which undermined the quality of information presented in the 

NTC’s Consolidated FS. 

 

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES 

 

20. The validity and accuracy of Accounts Receivable amounting to 
₱3,256,040,422.44 as at December 31, 2020, cannot be relied upon due to the 

discrepancy amounting to ₱86,698,015.01 between the balances per Accounting books 

and Service Units’ (SUs’) records brought about by the lack of efficient and effective 

system of assessment, billing, collection and recording of receivables. Moreover, 

Management failed to assess the collectability of the long outstanding receivables and 

provide allowance for impairment thereof, thus, contributing to the non-reliability of 

the account balance.  

 

21. Section 123 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 defines internal control as the plan of 
organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization 

or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, 

and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.  Section 124 further provides 

that it shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and 

monitor a sound system of internal control. 

 

22. Section 40 (e) of Public Service Act, otherwise known as Commonwealth Act No. 
146, as amended, requires all Public Telecommunications Entities (PTEs), Broadcast and 

Cable TV Networks to pay annual Supervision and Regulation Fees (SRF) to NTC on or 

before 30 September of each year and extended to 30 November 2020 for the payment of 

2020 SRF under NTC Memorandum Order No. 08-06-2020 dated June 8, 2020. 

 

23. As one of the revenue-generating units of the government, assessment, billing and 
collection cycle are essential phases in the operation of the Commission. The process starts 

when a company applies for or renew its license, evaluation by the Service Units (SUs), 

approval of application, assessment of fees, billing, issuance of OP, collection, and 

issuance of license/permit. 

 

24. The NTC-CO collects SRF for telecommunications, broadcast, cable TV and 
wireless pay TV companies as part of the agency’s mandate. The assessment of SRF for 

telecommunications services and all aspects of interconnection is performed by Regulatory 

Branch-Services and Interconnection Division (RB-SID), while the assessment of SRF for 



51 

 

broadcast TV, radio (AM/FM) and CATV is prepared by the Broadcast Service Division 

(BSD).  The Commission Secretariat (ComSec) acts on matters affecting petitions and 

applications for authorizations, i.e., Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for 

telecommunications and Certificate of Public Convenience for broadcast, Certificate of 

Authority for CATV, and other related matters. 

 

25. Initial walkthrough of the processes revealed that that NTC-CO still uses manual 
process in the assessment, billing and collection of various fees. Assessment of fees are 

manually computed by the assigned personnel in each SU. Collection letters, Order of 

Payment (OP) as well as Aging of Receivable Reports are also manually prepared by the 

NTC personnel. 

 

26. The SUs assess the annual SRF based on the Client’s latest submitted audited 
financial statements and issue Statement of Account (SOA) to the same Client who will in 

turn submit the SOA to the Accounting Unit (AU) for the preparation of the OP. The OP 

will be presented by the Client to the Cashier for payment. 

 

27. At the end of the year, the SUs submit the schedules of SOAs to the AU for 
recording of receivables, while the Cashier submits the Report of Collections and Deposits 

(RCD) every month. 

 

28. The Cash Unit has been using a computerized system in the issuance of Official 
Receipts and generation of RCD, however, in June 2020, the system encountered problems 

and they reverted to manual issuance of OR and preparation of RCD. 

 

29. The manual process may be inefficient for government agencies that have 
voluminous daily transactions. With the insufficiency of personnel in the Units, it may be 

prone to errors as shown in the observations below. 

 

a. Discrepancy between the balances per books of accounts and Service Units’ 
records amounting to ₱86,698,015.01 

 

30. As at December 31, 2020, the Accounts Receivable (AR) account balance of 
₱3,256,040,422.44 differed by an absolute amount of ₱86,698,015.01 with the RB-SID, 

BSD and ComSec reports of uncollected income totaling ₱3,276,945,460.41 as at CY 2020. 

The details are shown in Table 3.

31. Analysis of the records disclosed the following deficiencies that have caused the 
noted discrepancies:

52 

 

 

a. Lack of policy on monitoring of receivables by the AU 
 

Inquiry with the Chief, Finance disclosed that NTC has no existing policy with 

regard to the submission of assessment and SOA directly to the AU and the 

recording of receivables. Though the AU prepares the OP, it fails to maintain a 

separate monitoring of the assessment and collection of fees, subsidiary ledgers or 

schedules of receivables for each type of revenue/income, allegedly due to lack of 

manpower and voluminous transactions. 

 

b. Derecognition of receivables by the RB-SID 
 

The variance between the accounting records and the RB-SID was due to the 

derecognition of the receivables in the RB-SID records in the amount of 

₱22,737,886.52, which pertains to receivables from five (5) companies that already 

ceased operations and two (2) retired businesses.  

 

The derecognition was not recorded in the Accounting books due to non-

submission of supporting documents by the Service Units allegedly due to lack of 

policy and directive to guide them in the flow of documents and information for 

such transaction.    

 

c. Unreconciled beginning balance 
 

Included in the discrepancy of the AU records and the records of BSD and ComSec 

was the ₱10,158,602.00 unreconciled beginning balance between the AU records 

and the records of BSD and ComSec amounting to ₱45,226.35 and ₱10,113,375.65, 

respectively. The discrepancy has been observed in CY 2019 audit report, however, 

reconciliation between AU and SUs has yet to be undertaken.  
                                                  

d. Non-recording of the assessment and collection of fees of BSD and ComSec by 
the AU 

 

The assessment and collection of fees of BSD and ComSec in CY 2020 in the net 

amount of ₱53,801,526.49 were not recorded by the AU, which resulted in the 

understatement of both the Accounts Receivable and the revenue by the same 

amount. The details are shown in Table 4. 
 

Table 4. Summary of Unrecorded Accounts Receivable and Revenue 

Servicing Unit Assessments Collections Net 

BSD 215,678,448.70 169,470,712.09 46,207,736.61  

ComSec 8,831,150.00 1,237,360.12  7,593,789.88  

Total 224,509,598.70 170,708,072.21  53,801,526.49  

 

The non-recording of the assessment and collection of fees was due to the non-

maintenance of a separate record of the AU. The AU relies on the records/schedules 



53 

 

of the SUs, which were not submitted on time, along with the RCD submitted by 

the Cashier in the recording of revenues and receivables. It was also noted that the 

assessments and SOAs were not attached as support to the schedule submitted to 

the AU at the end of the year.  

 

32. The receivables and revenue generated in CY 2020 could have been timely and 
properly recorded in the books had the AU monitored the billings and payments made and 

maintained a separate record instead of relying solely on the SUs records. Likewise, the 

discrepancies between the AU and SUs records could have been immediately adjusted had 

there been a regular reconciliation between the Units. 

 

33. Moreover, as noted in the previous year’s audit report, the AU recorded all the 
collections reported by the Cashier in RCD as income, which includes SRF, fines and 

penalties, hence, collections pertaining to prior year receivables were not identified nor 

properly recognized as reduction to Accounts Receivables, but, instead, treated as current 

income during the year they were collected. 

 

34. The lack of an efficient system of assessment, billing and collection exposes the 
agency to the risk of errors or even fraud. It also caused the failure of the AU to maintain 

a more reliable records in the monitoring of revenues and receivables. 

 

35. A computerized system would increase the efficiency in the assessment, billing and 
collection process which could result in timely, accurate and reliable reports that could help 

Management in decision-making. It could aid the AU to timely detect and correct 

discrepancies in Accounts Receivable and record revenues accurately. 
 

36. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. devise well-defined processes that will ensure an efficient system of billing and 
issuance of order of payment as well as the related processes of assessment of 

fees, collections, issuance of licenses and permits, and maintenance of records 

therefor, and consider the computerization of said processes that will allow 

the smooth flow of transactions from both NTC Central Office and Regional 

Offices; and 

 

b. require the AU and the SUs to check/investigate the noted variances between 
their records and adjust/effect corrections accordingly, based on proper 

documentation.  
 

Management Comments: 

 

37. Management commented that the AU and the SUs were instructed to reconcile their 
records to check the accuracy of the noted variance based on proper documentation. 

 

38. Management further stated that the NTC is in the process of harmonizing the 
issuance of Statements of Account and Orders of Payment for the billing of all fees and 



54 

 

charges of NTC Central Offices and Regional Offices as required by the Anti-Red Tape 

Act.  

 

39. Accordingly, Management have discussions with the SUs and ROs on the effective 
electronic way of computing fees and charges. Currently, NTC engages the services of 

PayMaya to assist in the electronic payment of fees and charges of clients in collaboration 

with the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) and the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP). 

 

b. Failure to assess the collectability of the long outstanding receivables and provide 
allowance for impairment 

 

40. Management failed to assess the collectability of the long outstanding receivables 
and provide allowance for impairment despite the perceived uncertainty in the 

collectability of these receivables due to lack of defined policy on the matter. 

 

41. Paragraph 32 of IPSAS 9 provides that revenue is recognized only when it is 
probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the transaction will 

flow to the entity.  In some cases, this may not be probable until the consideration is 

received or until an uncertainty is removed.  However, when an uncertainty arises about 

the collectability of an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectable amount, or 

the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognized as an 

expense, rather as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized.   

 

42. Under Section 9, Chapter 5 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), 
Volume I, the recognition of expense for amounts recognized as revenue with uncertainty 

about its collectability is done through the recognition of Impairment Losses and 

Allowance for Impairment Losses. 

 

43. Section 10, Chapter 7 thereof provides that an entity shall assess at the end of each 
reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 

financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity shall measure the amount 

of loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of 

estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest 

rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use of an 

allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit. In case 

of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount 

based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of 

accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified 

doubtful accounts.  

 

44. Accounts Receivables (ARs) are considered current assets as they are expected to 
be collected in less than one year. However, the aging of the receivables of the three (3) 

SUs showed that only ₱281,190,694.18 or 8.58 percent of the total ARs are aged less than 

one (1) year and the amount of ₱988,097,674.58 or 30.15 percent aged 1 year to 5 years, 

the amount of ₱1,043,393,183.83 or 31.84 percent aged 6 years to 10 years and the amount 

of ₱964,263,907.79 or 29.43 percent aged 10 years above. The details are shown below:

Percentage 8.58% 30.15% 31.84% 29.43% 100.00% 
 

45. The non-collection of receivables for more than one year indicates the existence of 
problems/issues that affect their collectability which were not identified by Management 

and acted upon. 
 

46. Likewise review of the Notes to the Financial Statements disclosed that a total of 
₱3,124,692,003.37 or 95.97 percent of the year-end balance of ARs was not collected due 

to uncertainties such as cases pending before courts and the NTC itself, as summarized 

below: 

 
Table 6. Summary of “protested” receivables 

Description Amount 

4 Cases pending before the Court 3,065,784,132.34 

15 Cases pending before NTC - RB 17,455,729.99 

7 Cases Administrative Case/For Legal Action 18,714,254.52 

5 Cases Ceased Operations 22,120,324.92 

2 cases 617,561.60 

      Total  3,124,692,003.37 

 
47. The receivables labeled as “4 Cases pending before the Court” totaling 
₱3,065,784,132.34, which were filed with Regional Trial Courts (RTC) and the Supreme 

Court (SC) remained unresolved for at least 14 years. Two of these companies have already 

ceased to exist as duly enfranchised telecommunications companies due to the expiration 

of their franchise. 

 

48. This has been an observation in previous years, but still no action was taken by 
Management.  

 

49. Interview with the Chief, Finance disclosed that the Accounts Receivable 
impairment policy of the NTC is yet to be issued. 

 

50. The above observations affected the reliability of the reported balance of Accounts 
Receivables in the NTC’s Statement of Financial Position as well as the revenue reported 

in the Statement of Financial Performance. 
 

51. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. issue guidelines/policy on the assessment of collectability of receivables 
through the evaluation of relevant factors and determine the amount of 



56 

 

allowance for impairment to be provided for the agency’s accounts receivables 

and furnish such information to the Accountant; and  

 

b. require the AU, SUs and/or other concerned officials to assess the 
collectability of the agency’s accounts receivables based on the issued 

guidelines and recognize in the books the allowance for impairment. 

 

Management Comments: 
 

52. Management instructed the Regulation Branch to prepare a separate report on the 
entities with decision to stop the collection of SRF and must be submitted to AU as 

reference for impairment and write-off.  

 

53. Management commented that the Accounts Receivables that have pending cases in 
court and cannot be subject for impairment since it may be used by the clients against 

NTC’s claim on receivables. 

 

Unliquidated fund transfers to Procurement Service (PS)/Implementing Agencies recorded 

under Due from NGAs 
 

54. The balance of fund transfers to DBM-PS and DOST-ASTI amounting to 
₱3,726,198.29 and ₱25,568,000.00, respectively, recorded under the account Due from 

NGAs, remained unliquidated, despite completion of the agreed undertaking, 

submission of duly supported terminal report by the implementing agency and/or 

completion of the project timeline, contrary to the Memorandum of Agreement of the 

parties and COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994.  
 

55. Paragraph 4.5 of Article 4 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) executed on 
November 18, 2016 by and between the NTC and the PS provides that – The PS shall return 

to the NTC the unexpended balance of the project funds within fifteen (15) days upon 

completion of the Project and payment to the contractor, without need of demand from the 

NTC. 

 

56. Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 requires the 
Implementing Agency (IA) to submit within 10 days after the end of each month or end of 

the agreed period for the project the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of 

Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of funds.  

 

57. Section 5.4 of the same COA Circular requires that, among others, the Source 
Agency (SA) shall require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of 

the journal voucher taking up the expenditures. 

 

The balance of Due from NGAs account of the NTC showed the following:

58. In RO X, out of the original fund transfer made on February 20, 2017 of 
₱15,850,000.00 to DBM-PS, only ₱12,123,801.71 cost of various communication and IT 

equipment and motor vehicles were delivered, leaving a balance of ₱3,726,198.29. 

 

59. All the items were delivered to the NTC-CO, except for one (1) unit motor vehicle 
costing ₱1,036,880.00 which was delivered to RO X in December 2019; however, the 

balance of ₱3,726,198.27 was not yet refunded by the DBM-PS, contrary to the provision 

of the MOA.  

 

60. On the other hand, the amounts of ₱12,368,000.00 and ₱13,200,000.00, or a total 
amount of ₱25,568,000.00 balance of transferred fund by RO I and RO XII, respectively, 

to the Department of Science and Technology – Advanced Science and Technology 

Institute (DOST-ASTI) for the development of a fixed and mobile broadband 

benchmarking system remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020. 

 

61. Out of the ₱13,200,000.00 transferred by the NTC-RO I to the DOST-ASTI, only 
₱832,000.00 cost of delivered equipment was recorded as liquidation, leaving an 

unliquidated amount of ₱12,368,000.00. It was learned, however, that the DOST-ASTI 

already submitted the Terminal Report, as follows: 

 

Table 8. Unliquidated Due from NGAs

62. Despite the submission of the duly supported Terminal Report and the refund of 
unexpended balance, however, the Accounting Unit has not recorded the liquidation, thus, 

expenses were not recognized and the receivable was not adjusted. 

 



58 

 

63. Likewise, in RO XII, the total amount of ₱13,200,000.00, also transferred to 
DOST-ASTI for the same project remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020. It was 

learned that the project should have been delivered on December 05, 2019, and completed 

on December 05, 2020. However, no report on the status of project implementation was 

submitted. 

 

64. We recommended and  Management agreed to require: 
 

a. RO X to coordinate with the NTC-CO for the status of the balance of fund 
transfer to DBM-PS and demand the refund of the unexpended balance;  

 

b. The Accountant of RO I to record the liquidation of the fund transfer to 
DOST-ASTI with the terminal report and supporting document as basis;  

 

c. RO XII to monitor and demand from the DOST-ASTI the RCI and RD to 
report on the utilization of the funds transferred and return the unused 

balance, if any, and demand completion of the project; and 

 

d. The implementing agencies to render/submit an accounting/liquidation of 
expenses as soon as the projects are completed pursuant to the above-cited 

regulations 

 

Management Comments: 

 

65. RO X Management commented that the AOM was already endorsed to the CO for 
appropriate action.  The letter-request on the status of unexpended balance shall be sent to 

the CO, furnishing the Auditor a copy thereof.  It was further added that the installation 

and testing of equipment was the reason for the delayed implementation. 

 

66. RO I Management committed to comply with the recommendations and assured the 
Audit Team that they will coordinate with ROs IV and XII, the Regional Offices included 

in the same Pilot Benchmarking Project, on the procedures taken by them in liquidating 

the Due from NGAs account. RO I Management also informed the Audit Team that there 

was an addendum to the MOA between ROs I, IV and XII, and the DOST-ASTI to make 

the latter a custodian for the equipment to be retained and the former shall decide on a 

future date whether to donate the properties retained by the DOST-ASTI or not. A copy of 

the addendum will be provided to the Audit Team. 

 

67. RO XII Management justified and explained some reasons for non-liquidation of 
fund as at December 31, 2020, as follows: 

  

a. Part of the executed Memorandum of Agreement was delivery of ICT 
Equipment to NTC-RO XII but still not made up to date; and 

 

b. There were amendments to the MOA but this has yet to be signed due to non-
compliance of the mentioned deliveries. 



59 

 

 

68. On February 15, 2021, RO XII Management, through the Accountant, sent an email 
to the DOST-ASTI requesting for the RCI and RD on the utilization of the funds transferred 

to them and also reiterated the status of the transfer of ICT Equipment to be used by the 

NTC.  The DOST-ASTI, on March 3, 2021, sent an email containing the copy of RCI and 

RD covering the period January to December 2020 relevant to the utilization of the fund 

for the NTC Netmesh Project.  

 

69. RO XII Management assured the regular monitoring on the progress of the project 
and will liquidate the fund transferred to the DOST-ASTI as soon as the supporting 

documents are submitted to them. 

 

INVENTORIES 

 

70. The balances of Inventory accounts were unreliable due to the discrepancy 
between the Accounting and Supply records amounting to ₱3,752,262.11 caused by, 

among others, the failure to conduct physical inventory by the Inventory Committee, 

delayed or non-submission of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) by the 

Supply Division, and non-maintenance of Supply Ledger Cards (SLC)  by the 

Accounting Unit and Stock Cards (SC), Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) and 

Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) by the Supply Division for monitoring. 

 

71. The following were noted deficiencies affecting the Inventory accounts:

72. NTC-CO disclosed that the Inventory Committee failed to conduct the semi-annual 
physical count in CY 2020 due to lack of personnel. NTC-RO I also stated that the lack of 

personnel precluded the Supply Officer from submitting the required reports on a timely 

manner. 

 

73. The above deficiencies cast doubt on the reliability of the year-end Inventory 
account balances in the financial statements. 

 

74. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Inventory Committee to conduct physical count of all the agency’s 
Inventories semi-annually and prepare the RPCI as basis in the conduct of 

regular reconciliation; 

 

b. Both the Supply Division and the Accounting Unit to check/investigate the 
noted variances between the recorded Inventories per books of accounts 

and RPCI and effect corrections on their records, as necessary, supported 

with complete documentation; 

  

c. The Supply Division to: 
 

i. Prepare RSMI, RIS and ICS; 
ii. Regularly submit RSMI to AU; and 

iii. Update the SC for all Inventory items; 
 

d. The Accounting Unit to: 
 

i. Maintain and update the SLC for all Inventory items; and 
ii. Effect the necessary journal entries to effect adjustments based on 

the reconciliation supported with adequate documents and record 

issuances of inventories based on RSMIs; and 

 

e. Through the Human Resource Division, to review the functions, systems 
and procedures, organizational structure and staffing in order to 

determine the appropriate human resource complement for their 

activities, pursuant to Section 11.4 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No.

Management Comments: 
 

75. NTC-CO Management stated that the Commission has conducted a coordination 
meeting with the Inventory Committee, the Supply Division and the AU to 

check/investigate and correct the noted variances between the recorded inventories per 

books of accounts and RPCI. 

 

76. All concerned ROs agreed and committed to comply with the recommendations. 
 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 

 

77. The existence and valuation of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
accounts could not be ascertained due to unreconciled discrepancy between the 

balance per books and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) amounting to ₱78,033,876.92, caused by, among others, the 

failure to conduct physical count of PPE by the Inventory Committee and the non-

maintenance of PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) by the Accounting Unit and Property 

Card (PC) and Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) by the Property Division 

for monitoring and as basis for reconciliation.

the cost and the related accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses of existing PPE which were not 
previously recognized due to the absence of 
ownership/title based on contract, memorandum of 
agreement and other reasons. Further, if no 
documents are available, an entity shall recognize the 
cost of the PPE based on fair value as of: (a) date of 
acquisition; (b) January 1, 2014 or (c) at the date the 
FV was determined. 
 

Absence of proper identification and coding 
requirements for PPE and reconciliation 
between the reports and the actual PPE on 
hand 

RO X Item 2 under Section V of COA Circular No. 80-124 
provides the proper identification on coding of PPE 
and Item 4 of the same circular states that all inventory 
reports shall be prepared on the prescribed form and 
certified correct by the committee in charge and 
thereof, noted by the Auditor and approved by the 
head of the agency. The reports shall be properly 
reconciled with accounting and inventory records.

79. The NTC-CO disclosed that the Inventory Committee failed to conduct the annual 
physical count in CY 2020 due to lack of personnel.  

 

80. In RO IV, the disposal of unserviceable properties was not conducted in the year 
2020 due to the pandemic and quarantine issue. 

 

81. The Property Custodian of RO VI explained that he will first check the 
unserviceable items if these are still repairable before preparing the IIRUP. The Audit 

Team rejoined that these assets were not used in the operations for a long time and that the 

agency had already procured a new model to be used in their operations. Hence, the 

capacity of these assets to provide the entity with future economic benefits or service 

potential is already questionable. 

 

82. RO X personnel disclosed that proper turnover from the previous Property Officer 
to the current was not performed. 

 

83. Thus, the deficiencies noted cast doubt on the existence, accuracy, validity and 
completeness of the recorded PPE in the books and RPCPPE as well as the year-end PPE 

account balances in the financial statements. 

 

84. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The respective Inventory Committees to conduct physical count of all the 
agency’s PPE periodically and prepare the RPCPPE based on physical 

count to serve as basis of regular reconciliation; 

 

b. The Property Division and the Accounting Unit to: 
 

i. Check/investigate the noted variances between the recorded PPE per 
books of accounts and property records/RPCPPE and adjust both 

records, as necessary, based on proper documentation; 

 

ii. Conduct regular reconciliation of their records and as much as 
possible reconciliation must be undertaken while physical count is in 

progress in order to settle immediately the discrepancy in both 

records; and 

 

iii. Determine the fair value of the unrecorded equipment found at the 
station; 

 

c. The Property Division to: 
 

i. Renew all the PARs to update all records of accountability for PPEs 
and update the PC for all PPE items; 

 



64 

 

ii. Properly label items of PPE and periodically check and replace such 
labels whenever the need arises; and 

 

iii. Timely evaluate the conditions of the PPE items and properly 
segregate as to serviceable and unserviceable and plan a disposal 

scheme for the unserviceable items; 

 

d. The Accounting Unit to: 
 

i. Maintain and update the PPELC for all PPE items; and 
 

ii. Effect necessary adjustments in the books of accounts supported by 
adequate supporting documents as basis;  

 

e. The concerned Accountable Office to immediately prepare the Report of 
Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) and other 

necessary documents that will serve as notification to the Accounting Unit 

for recording;  

 

f. The Disposal Committee to facilitate its disposal within the soonest possible 
time to prevent further deterioration and to generate income from sale, if 

any; and 

 

g. Through the Human Resource Division, to review the functions, systems 
and procedures, organizational structure and staffing in order to 

determine the appropriate human resource complement for their 

activities, pursuant to Section 11.4 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 

1, s. 2018 dated November 9, 2018, especially in the Accounting 

Department and GSD. 

 
Management Comments: 

 

85. NTC-CO Management created the PPE reconciliation team in response to the issues 
noted in the AOM with Office Order No. 26-03-2021 effective March 15, 2021. The PPE 

reconciliation team shall have the following functions and responsibilities: 

 

a. Conduct planning and scheduling of reconciliation activities; 
b. Assist the Inventory Committee for PPE in the conduct of FY 2021 Physical 

Count of PPE; 

c. Update PAR and PC in GSD and PPELC in AU; 
d. Reconcile GSD records with the AU Books; 
e. Install a PPE recording system that will result to efficient PPE management and 

minimal variances; 

f. Recommend to the top management policies on the impairment of PPE, 
amortization of Intangible Assets and disposal and appraisal of unserviceable 

PPE. 
 



65 

 

86. NCR Management committed that the documents pertaining to the noted 
deficiencies will be submitted to the COA. Physical count will also be conducted by the 

Inventory Committee in coordination with the AU. Management assured us that all the 

recommendations will be complied with. 

 

87. CAR Management explained that 35 PPEs with no PCs were the unserviceable 
PPEs that were adjusted only on December 31, 2020. Further, Management explained that 

the four (4) PPEs that were not part of the December 2020 adjustment have existing PCs 

but the records shall be adjusted or corrected due to incorrect records. Management agreed 

with the recommendation and committed that the Property Officer will prepare the PC for 

the 35 items included in the December 2020 adjustments and make corrections on the 4 

exiting PCs. 
 

88. RO I Management already submitted the request for inspection of unserviceable 
items to the Audit Team on January 8, 2021 and the same was already reviewed and 

evaluated by the Audit Team, and forwarded to the COA Technical Services Office (TSO) 

for their technical assistance. 

 

89. All concerned ROs agreed and committed to comply with the recommendations. 
 

Unliquidated Cash Advances 

 

90. Cash Advances granted to officers and employees of NTC Central Office to 
defray various expenses amounting to ₱3,048,725.77 remained unliquidated as at 

December 31, 2020, despite the purpose for which it was given has been served.  

 

91. Section 89 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and item 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 
97-002 dated February 10, 1997, provides that a cash advance shall be reported on and 

liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. 

 

92. Likewise, one of the basic principles under Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM, 
Volume I, in the recognition and presentation of financial transactions of an entity is 

accrual accounting.  Under this method, transactions and other events are recognized when 

they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 

transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the 

financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under 

accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses. 

 

93. As at December 31, 2020, nine (9) cash advances amounting to ₱3,048,725.77 
remained unliquidated, five (5) of which, totaling to ₱1,350,000.00, were granted in CY 

2019. The advances were drawn to pay for the current operating expenses of the agency 

for the year in which they were granted. 

 

94. Since the purpose for which these cash advances were given has been served, it is 
just proper to liquidate the same and the expenses be reported on as required by the above 

rules and regulations. The failure to liquidate them in the year the expenses were incurred, 



66 

 

thus, affected the fair presentation of cash advances, expenses, and accumulated 

surplus/deficit in the FS.  

 

95. We recommended and Management agreed to enforce strictly the immediate 
liquidation of cash advances as soon as the purpose for which they were  granted have 

been served or within the prescribed period pursuant to the above laws, rules and 

regulations and for proper recognition of expenses and settlement of cash advances. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

96.  Management stated that as at February 2021, four (4) out of the nine (9) cash 
advances issued have been liquidated and still in process with the Accounting Unit. With 

regard to the other five (5) cash advances that remained unliquidated as at March 19, 2021, 

Management has issued notice to the AOs/SDOs to liquidate their cash advances. Some 

liquidations are still in process due to incomplete supporting documents, which was already 

communicated to the AOs/SDOs.  

 

97. Management submitted the documents pertaining to the Liquidation of Cash 
Advances for the CY 2019 Uniform and Clothing Allowance of NTC Employees and 

Officials on May 3, 2021. The said liquidation is yet to be recorded in the books.  

 

INTERNAL CONTROL  
 

98. Weaknesses in the internal control system of the NTC-National Capital Region 
pertaining to the assessment, collection and deposit, and recording of revenues such 

that tampering of Official Receipts went undetected, thus, resulting in a cash shortage 

of at least ₱470,000.00 and affecting the reliability of the recorded revenue for CY 

2020.  

 

99. Section 123 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 defines internal control as the plan of 
organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization 

or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, 

and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.  Section 124 further provides 

that it shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and 

monitor a sound system of internal control. 

 

100. The NTC-NCR has formulated a Citizen’s Charter in compliance with RA 11032 
on the “Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018”. 

Comparison of the process of the issuance of permits and certificates with the walkthrough 

performed by the Audit Team as shown in Table 11, disclosed several deficiencies which 

are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.

a. Lack of segregation of duties in the preparation of Statement of Account (SOA) and 
Order of Payment (OP) 

 

101. Segregation of duties means assigning different people the responsibilities of 
authorizing transactions, recording transactions, and maintaining custody of assets. 

Segregation of duties is intended to reduce the opportunities to allow any person to be in a 

position to both perpetrate and conceal errors or fraud in the normal course of the person’s 

duties. 

 

102. Appendix 28 of the GAM, Volume II, states that the Order of Payment shall be 
prepared by the Accounting Unit on a Bill and it shall be prepared for each payor.  

 

103. As shown in Table 11, the pre-assessment stage, which includes the assessment of 
fees and preparation of SOA, is being done by the Enforcement and Operations Division 

(EOD) Engineers. On the other hand, the preparation of OP is done by the Accounting Unit 

(AU) staff.  

 

104. In actual practice, however, the OP for the payment of fees were being prepared by 
the EOD staff instead of the AU. Interview with the OIC, EOD and the Chief, Financial 

and Administrative Division (FAD) disclosed that due to the voluminous transactions and 

lack of personnel in the AU, the NTC-NCR Management issued Office Orders directing 

six (6) EOD personnel to be assigned as additional accounting staff. However, the said 

personnel were still not relieved from their duties in the EOD.  

 

105. Thus, the EOD personnel performs the assessment of fees and preparation of SOA 
for each client and at one time or another prepares the OP. This practice showed lack of 



68 

 

segregation of duties which connotes weakness in the internal control system. It was also 

observed that several critical processes are being done by Job Order staff. 

 

106. It is worth mentioning that the NTC-NCR has a Database Management and 
Licensing System application. However, it is only for license retrieval and update of client 

and payment details. The assessment, preparation of SOA and OP are still being done 

manually which is prone to error and possible fraud. Accordingly, the application is 

currently undergoing enhancement and augmentation as part of the agency’s CY 2020 

project to include the assessment, generation of OP and SOA.  

 

107. A review of the advance copy of the enhancement project, however, showed that 
the AU is not included in the process flow of the application. 

  

108. Management commented that in 2018, the NTC-NCR implemented Appendix 28 
of the GAM, Volume II prescribing that the Accounting Division/Unit shall prepare the 

Order of Payment based on a Bill and it shall be prepared for each payor. Likewise,  Office 

Order No. 033-09-2018 was issued directing the AU to prepare the OP, but the AU was 

unable to handle the volume of applications which resulted in several complaints received 

by the regions due to the slow release of the OPs. Hence, the NTC-NCR assigned some 

engineers from the EOD to assist the AU in the issuance of the OPs.  

 

109. The responsibility for the preparation and issuance of the OPs was, however, 
reverted to the AU under Office Order No. NCR-005-03-2021 dated March 4, 2021 as a 

result of our discussion with Management on the internal control (IC) weakness uncovered 

during our conduct of a walkthrough of the IC processes of the NTC. 

 

110. On the issue of JOs assigned to critical processes, Management justified that the 
JOs are directly under the supervision of the Licensing Supervisor as well as the assigned 

Evaluators/Assessors (Engineers I and II).  Further, it is the Supervisor and/or the 

Evaluator/Assessor who evaluates in the processing stage and assigns the encoding process 

to JOs. There are only three (3) technical staff at the Licensing Unit who evaluate the 

application, and assess and prepare the SOA on a particular day such that they could not 

cope with the tasks at hand, thus, the JOs are a big help for accomplishing the work to be 

done. 
 

b. Non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers (SLs) and schedules 
 

111. Section 12, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I lists the books of accounts to be 
maintained by national government agencies, one of which is the subsidiary ledger (SL). 

Appendix 6, GAM, Volume II, states that the SL shows the details for each control account 

in the GL which is maintained per account by the Accounting Unit. At the end of each 

month, after all transactions in the journals have been posted, the debit and credit columns 

of each account shall be footed in pencil and the balance indicated in ink. The totals of the 

SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account. 

 



69 

 

112. The AU does not maintain subsidiary ledgers or schedules for each type of 
revenue/income in order to monitor the revenue accounts. The recording of the accounts 

was based on the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) prepared by the Cash Unit and 

submitted monthly to the AU.  

 

113. It should be noted that since the OP, together with the SOA, go through the 
Accounting Unit every time a client processes his/her application/renewal of 

license/permits, this should have been the basis of the AU to record revenue in the SL to 

capture real time transactions. In this manner, the RCD being submitted by the Cash Unit 

on a monthly basis may then be counter-checked based on the entries in the SLs. 

 

114. Management stated that due to lack of manpower, several procedures were delayed 
or not completed, hence, the preparation and maintenance of SLs and schedules were not 

undertaken extensively.  

 

c. Lack of review and approval  
 

115. Section 40, Chapter 5 of the GAM, Volume I, presented the detailed procedures for 
Collections and Deposits through the Collecting Officer. The RCD shall be prepared daily 

by the Collecting Officer, which the Head of Cash/Treasury Unit shall review and sign, for 

submission to the Accounting Unit. 

 

116. We noted that the Cash Unit does not have a Unit Head to review the correctness 
and accuracy of the reports prepared by the Collecting Officer. The RCD was prepared by 

the Collecting Officer and was directly submitted to the AU. There was no higher official 

to review, check and approve the output of the Collecting Officer or the RCD before 

submission to the AU, hence, any error or deficiency could not be detected. 

 

d. Lack of check and balance in assessments and collections 
 

117. The EOD maintains an Excel file for all SOA issued which were pre-numbered. 
However, no monitoring is being conducted on the SOAs issued such that the list contains 

no indication whether a certain SOA has been paid or not.  

 

118. On a sampling basis, we compared the SOA and the OP from the EOD with the 
collections/Official Receipts (ORs) issued by the Cashier and we noted a discrepancy of 

₱2,680,471.18. We conducted a reconciliation of said discrepancy but we were able to 

reconcile only the amount totaling ₱447,013.28, which was paid in January 2021. 

Reconciliation of the remaining discrepancy is still on-going as of this report. The OIC, 

EOD reasoned that there is a possibility that the unpaid SOA was either cancelled or 

replaced with a new one. 

 

119. However, in the course of our examination of the ORs, we noted that two (2) ORs, 
i.e., OR Nos. 1157749 and 1158050 amounting to ₱2,444,010.00 and ₱143,390.00, 

respectively, were tampered with. Further investigation revealed that the OR copies of the 

Clients (i.e., two clients) and the Accounting Unit were not tampered with and reflect the 



70 

 

amounts of ₱2,514,010.00 and ₱543,390.00, respectively; thereby, showing a shortage 

totaling ₱470,000.00 as the amounts reported in the RCD were the amounts in the tampered 

ORs. Since the recording by the AU is based on the RCD, then, the actual collections and 

the recorded amounts are the same, thus, no shortage can be detected. It would only be 

upon examination of the ORs that a shortage could be detected.  

 

120. Errors or fraud in the recording of collections could have been detected had the AU 
maintained a separate record instead of relying solely on the Cashier’s schedule, and the 

payment status of the assessment could likewise be monitored had the process of preparing 

the OP been done by the AU as prescribed by the GAM. 

 

121. Management commented that the NTC-NCR has a database system that can be used 
as a tool to compare the OPs with the ORs issued but due to the lack of manpower, the bulk 

of transactions, and the absence of concrete procedures for internal control, an error or 

fraud has occurred. As an initial measure to address the situation, the following were 

undertaken by the NTC-NCR Management: 

 

a. Issued a Memorandum addressed to the Collecting Officer who altered the ORs 
and to another Collecting Officer who prepared the RCD to explain the reason 

for the alterations made on OR Nos. 1157749 and 11580050 and the 

discrepancy between the Daily Report of Collection and the triplicate copy of 

the OR. 

 

In a written explanation submitted, the Collecting Officer admitted to altering 

the SOA and the duplicate OR to balance with the collection which resulted in 

a shortage of recorded collection in the amount of ₱470,000.00. The said 

shortage was restituted by the Collecting Officer and deposited on March 3, 

2021, while the one who prepared the RCD has not submitted any explanation 

yet. 

 

b. The Collecting Officer who admitted to altering the SOA and the OR was 
relieved of his duties and responsibilities on March 8, 2021 through the 

issuance of a Memorandum dated March 4, 2021. 

 

c. The Chief of FAD, NTC-NCR and the Accountant are currently in the process 
of checking the collections and deposits made in 2020. 

 

122. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Include the AU, as approving officer of the OP, in the enhancement and 
augmentation of the Database Management and Licensing System 

application; 

 

b. Require the AU to prepare SLs and schedules, and to properly monitor the 
revenue accounts; 

 



71 

 

c. Assign/Designate a Head of the Cash Unit to review the reports prepared 
by the Collecting Officer before submitting to the AU; 

 

d. Investigate further the extent of the tampering done by the Collecting 
Officer and file appropriate charges, if necessary, as soon as possible; and 

 

e. Review the processes and install strong internal control measures to 
prevent a similar occurrence in the future.  

 

Management Comments: 

 

123. Management stated that they: 
 

a. will hire a bookkeeper who will maintain the subsidiary ledgers and the related 
schedules; 

b. will designate a personnel who will act as the Head of the Cash Unit; 
c. are drafting procedures to build up strong internal controls; 
d. will prepare a Memorandum regarding the guidelines and procedures for the 

preparation of the SOA, and the assignment of reference numbers for proper 

monitoring of SOAs; 

e. will file a case against the Collecting Officer who tampered with the ORs, i.e.,  
after further audit and verification of cash shortages aside from ₱470,000.00 

noted by the COA; 

f. included the AU in the Enhancement and Augmentation of NCR Database 
Management and Licensing System; and 

g. hired JO employees to process the certificates which are under the supervision 
of the regular employees or the engineers and the accountability lies with the 

engineers. 

 

Compliance Audit 
 

Deficiencies in Bonds of accountable officers 

 

124. Several deficiencies were noted in the bonding of accountable officers (AOs) 
of ROs, thus, exposing government funds to possible risks.  
 

125. The following deficiencies were noted in the bonding of AOs:

Annex C of the same Circular shows 
the maximum cash accountability and 
the corresponding amount of bond. 
 

Failure to renew fidelity bond of AO RO II Section 7.2 of Treasury Circular No. 02-
2009 dated August 6, 2009 provides 
that the fidelity bond of an accountable 
public officer shall be renewed before 
the expiration of the bond. 
 

Petty Cash Fund (PCF) Custodian not properly bonded 
as disbursing officer 

RO V Section 14, Chapter 6 of the GAM, 
Volume I provide that except for cash 
advance for official travel, no officer or 
employee shall be granted cash 
advance unless he/she is properly 
bonded in accordance with existing 
laws or regulations. 

 

126. In RO II, verification of monthly collections showed that the Accountable Officers 
are not adequately bonded based on the Maximum Cash Accountabilities (MCAs) provided 

in Annex C of Treasury Circular No. 02- 2009. This is caused by the increase in collections 

of the Region which was not anticipated during the renewal of the fidelity bonds of the 

AOs. The fidelity bond of the Special Collecting Officer, which expired on May 2020, was 

renewed only on January 2021. 

 

127. In RO XIII, the total monthly collections and disbursements of the 
Collecting/Disbursement Officer from January to December 2020, showed an average 

monthly accountability of ₱5,772,622.55. However, review of the request for renewal of 

fidelity bonds as the Disbursing/Collecting Officer revealed that her bond was already 

renewed last October 13, 2020 with an approved amount of bond of ₱350,000.00, which is 

not enough to cover the AO’s accountability. 

 

128. The NTC-RO V AO was an alternate collecting officer prior to her assumption as 
PCF Custodian (PCFC) pursuant to NTC-RO V Office Order No. 002-02-2020 dated 

February 20, 2020. Having assumed the additional designation in February 2020, the AO’s 

accountability likewise increased as she was entrusted with a petty cash fund of 

₱10,000.00, subject to replenishment. Review of the existing fidelity bond of the PCFC 

disclosed that the approved bond of the AO was only for the accountabilities of a collecting 

officer. Hence, Management should not have allowed/granted the cash advance because 

the existing bond coverage pertains only to the collection of public funds for remittance to 

the Bureau of the Treasury.  The PCFC was not bonded on accountabilities for public fund 

as a disbursing officer.  

 

129. It is of utmost importance that AOs are bonded adequately to cover the level of 
collections/cash advances they handle to provide protection to the government in case of 

unrelieved losses in the accounts of the AOs. Inadequacy of the bond exposes the 

government funds to a possible risk of loss. 



73 

 

 

130. We recommended that Management:  
 

a. Increase the amount of bond of the concerned AOs to adequately cover 
their accountabilities;  
 

b. Require the concerned AO to renew his fidelity bond;  
 

c. Require the concerned PCF Custodian to liquidate the petty cash fund; 
apply for an increase in bond to cover the accountabilities for public fund 

as a disbursing officer; and suspend the grant of PCF of ₱10,000.00 or 

decrease the amount to ₱5,000.00 pending receipt of the approved bond 

from the Bureau of Treasury (BTr); and 
 

d. Regularly monitor the cash accountabilities of the AOs to determine 
whether an increase or decrease of their bonds is needed. 

 

Management comments: 

 

131. RO XIII Management commented that the BTr had evaluated the sufficiency of 
fidelity bond of all their Accountable officers. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

132. In RO XIII, we requested the result of the assessment and/or evaluation of the BTr 
but Management failed to submit such assessment. 

 

Non-compliance with rules and regulations on petty cash 
 

133. ROs V, VI and XI had not fully complied with the guidelines on the use and 
maintenance of the PCF for petty operating expenses.  

 

134. Table 13 summarizes the deficiencies noted in the management of PCF of the 
concerned ROs.

Item 1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-

135. In RO V, we noted that 91 percent or ₱35,017.65 of the total disbursements for CY 
2020 were reimbursements from various employees, which is not in accordance with the 

principle implied on the grant of PCF. Various official receipts, sales invoices and other 



74 

 

evidence of payment submitted for liquidation have dates prior to the date of the petty cash 

voucher and receipt of fund from the PCF Custodian. Said expenses should have been 

reimbursed by ADA covered by disbursement voucher, instead of paying them out of the 

PCF. Payment of reimbursements out of the PCF defeats the objective of granting a cash 

advance, which contemplates future or prospective expenses and not those already 

incurred.  

 

136. RO VI was not able to designate a PCF Custodian and establish a Petty Cash Fund 
for recurring small value expenses. Hence, small value expenses amounting to ₱72,337.33 

were paid through reimbursements, which are considered improper since these transactions 

did not go through the proper disbursement process. 

 

137. Verification of documents supporting the liquidations and replenishments of the 
PCF in RO XI revealed that only receipts and sales invoices were attached thereto.  All 

other supporting documents required under Item 1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012 were not attached. 

 

138. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Designate PCF Custodians and establish Petty Cash Funds for 
offices/operating units determined to have a reasonable need for such fund 

in RO VI; 

 

b. Require the concerned PCF Custodian to refrain from reimbursing 
previously paid expenses from PCF;  

 

c. Require the concerned officials and employees to claim reimbursement of 
expenses paid with their personal money based on approved Disbursement 

Vouchers with complete supporting documents; 

 

d. Enjoin the concerned employees and the Disbursing Officer to stop the 
practice of the reimbursement system; and 

 

e. Require the concerned PCF Custodians to ensure that all Petty Cash 
Vouchers are adequately supported with the mandatory documentary 

requirements. 
 

Management Comments: 

 

139. RO XI Management explained that the PCFs were not utilized fully and replenished 
regularly due to the prevailing circumstances where most of the NTC officials and 

personnel were on Work from Home (WFH) Alternative Work Arrangement  due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic.  They, however, committed to submit the pertinent lacking 

supporting documents of the replenishments. Management also explained that some 

replenishments did not have any supporting document because those were extraordinary 

expenses of the Office of the Regional Director. 



75 

 

 

140. All concerned ROs agreed and committed to comply with the recommendations. 
 

Deficiencies on Disbursements 

 

141. Several Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) paid by ROs CAR, II, VI, VII and IX 
were not supported with complete and proper documentation; thus, the legality and 

validity of the transactions could not be readily established. Moreover, several 

deficiencies were noted in the payment of DVs. 

 

142. Section 4 of PD 1445 sets forth the fundamental principles governing financial 
transactions and operations of any government agency, one of which is that claims against 

government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

143. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the revised guidelines 
and documentary requirements for common government transactions. 

 

144. Audit of disbursements revealed several expenses were paid despite incomplete 
documentation, as summarized in Table 14. 

 
Table 14. Summary of DVs with incomplete documentation 

NTC Office Audit observation 

RO II Payment of communication equipment, service recognition incentive, 
athletic allowance and service repair incentive expenses with a total amount 
of ₱295,274.82 were not supported with complete documentary 
requirements 

RO VI Payment of salaries of Job Order personnel amounting to ₱372,974.15 were 
not supported with approved contracts, daily time records and 
accomplishment reports 

RO VII Payment of procurement of equipment, terminal leave benefits, repairs of 
vehicles and Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) amounting to 
₱1,384,378.08 were not supported with complete documentary 
requirements 

RO IX Payment of salaries and wages, security services, hazard pay, salary 
differential, various procurements, building rentals, newspaper 
subscriptions, remittances to the HDMF, PhilHealth, Telecommunications 
Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (TESALAI), and Employees Union ng 
Natelco (EMPLU) and PhilHealth contributions were paid despite incomplete 
documentation 
 
Purchase Orders (POs) were not completely filled out as to printed name 
and signature of the supplier or his authorized representative who received 
the PO, date when the PO was received by the supplier and date of delivery 

RO XIII Claims for CNA incentive of officials and employees of the NTC, RO XIII in 
the amount of ₱487,390.00 were not supported with complete documentary 
requirements 

 



76 

 

145. The Accountant of RO VI contended that the Job Order (JO) personnel were 
required to prepare these documents but due to recent happenings brought about by the 

COVID-19 pandemic, they were not able to timely submit it. For humanitarian 

considerations, however, they fast-tracked the processing of the salaries of the JO 

personnel despite the incomplete supporting documents. However, we believe that the 

payment to the JO personnel from January to February 2020 should not have been made 

without the complete supporting documents since there was no COVID-19 pandemic yet 

during these months.  For wages facilitated during the pandemic, the JO personnel should 

have been required to still submit the supporting documents even though they were already 

paid their wages. 
 

146. Accordingly, Notices of Suspension were issued to RO VI and Management was  
able to partially submit the required documents. Notices of Settlement of Suspensions and 

Disallowances will be issued upon completion of the required documents and proper 

evaluation by the Audit Team thereat. 

 

147. With the lack of complete supporting documents, the propriety and validity of the 
transactions could not be readily established. 
 

148. Moreover, several deficiencies were also noted in the payment of DVs: 
 

Table 15. Summary of Deficiencies on Payment of DVs 

NTC Office Deficiency Standard/Criteria 
CAR DVs were processed and paid before 

inspection and acceptance 
Section 88 of PD 1445 states that, 
except with the prior approval of the 
President, the government shall not 
be obliged to make an advance 
payment for services not yet 
rendered or for supplies and 
materials not yet delivered under any 
contract therefor. No payment, partial 
or final, shall be made on any such 
contract except upon a certification 
by the head of the agency concerned 
to the effect that the services or 
supplies and materials have been 
rendered or delivered in accordance 
with the terms of the contract and 
have been duly inspected and 
accepted. 

RO XI Advance payment on government 
contracts 

RO II, RO XIII Vouchers and their supporting 
documents were not stamped “PAID” 

Section 2 of COA Circular No. 92-389 
provides among others, that paid 
voucher, including its supporting 
documents, shall be perforated and 
conspicuously stamped “PAID” by 
the Cashier. 

RO VII Several disbursements are still paid 
through checks

Management (DBM) Circular Letter 
No. 2013-16 dated December 23,

2018-14 dated December 28, 2018 



77 

 

 

149. In CAR, DVs amounting to ₱3,994,294.71 were recorded in the books of accounts 
and ₱2,400,311.71, representing purchase of Information and Communications 

Technology (ICT) and Communications equipment were paid before inspection and 

acceptance. 

 

150. In RO IX, a check in the amount of P49,709.00 was issued on September 29, 2020, 
for the payment of security services for the period October 1-31, 2020, where no services 

have been rendered yet, in violation of Section 88 of PD 1445 and its related issuances 

prohibiting advance payment of government contracts and is considered improper and may 

be suspended or disallowed in audit. 

 

151. Verification of transactions of ROs II and XIII disclosed that vouchers and their 
supporting documents were not stamped “PAID’, thus, these documents are susceptible to 

possible re-use. Vouchers and supporting documents should be stamped “PAID” upon 

payment to avert the use of these documents to similar claims in the future. 

 

152. In RO VII, a total of 244 checks were issued in CY 2020 for payment of various 
creditors/payees. Verification of those checks disclosed that some payments could have 

been paid through ADA such as internal creditors (e.g., employees of the agency), regular 

and recurring suppliers, and others. It was also noted that during the year, 20 checks were 

cancelled. Check entails cost, thus every cancelled check is considered waste of 

accountable property. This could have been avoided when those transactions were paid 

through ADA since ADA is just a printable document.  

 

153. The Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) contributed to the substantial 
reduction of agencies’ due and demandable Accounts Payable and has minimized the 

volume of outstanding checks. In addition, said scheme has addressed cash programming 

concerns relative to resource predictability requirement by providing specific schedule of 

payments, hence, compliance thereof is enjoined.  

 

154. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Enjoin the concerned Disbursing Officers to scrutinize carefully all the 
supporting documents attached to the disbursement vouchers before 

payment is made and submit the lacking supporting documents for the 

audited transactions to avoid suspension or disallowance in audit;  

 

b. Require the Accountant to ensure the completeness of supporting 
documents prior to the approval of the disbursements and the payment of 

claims;  

 

c. Stop making advance payments for services not yet rendered as it is a 
violation of the pertinent provisions of Section 88 of PD 1445 and related 

COA issuances which may be suspended or disallowed in audit; and 

 



78 

 

d. Fully adopt the Modified Direct Payment Scheme in the settlement of all 
accounts payable due both external and internal creditors/payees and to 

minimize, if not totally eliminate, the use of checks in making payments. 

 

Management Comments:  

 

155. CAR Management commented that the Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) was about 
to lapse, hence, a check was prepared prior to inspection and acceptance. 

 

156. RO IX Management commented that due to COVID-19 and the urgency of the 
procurements and other necessary payments, the concerned personnel tasked to validate 

the documents submitted for payment might have overlooked the deficiencies noted in the 

AOM. An Office Memorandum shall be issued to the concerned units to ensure that all 

supporting documents are supplied, properly filled up, and signed prior to payment in 

accordance with Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

  

157. Management commented that RO XIII had always been keen on following and 
submitting pertinent supporting documents before payment shall be made to claimants.  

With regard to the payment of CNA,  they had abided by the provisions set forth by DBM 

Budget Circular No. 2020-05 dated November 4, 2020, “Guidelines on the grant of CNA 

Incentive for FY 2020 and the provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 

Section 71, “Rules in the Grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentive.” 

 

158. All concerned ROs agreed and committed to comply with the recommendations 
and ensure that proper rules and regulations are followed at all times. 

 

Delay in submission of financial reports and transaction documents 

 

159. Delays in the submission of financial reports, transaction records, bank 
reconciliation statements, and copies of contracts/purchase orders, which were not in 

keeping with pertinent provisions of the rules stated below, prevented the Audit Team 

from conducting thorough analysis and verification of the accounts and transactions 

for the timely discharge of relevant audit results. 

 

160. As in the previous year, the late submission of the financial reports, disbursement 
and collection records and copies of contracts/purchase orders had been observed during 

the year, as shown in Table 16.

161. The delayed submission of financial reports, bank reconciliation statements, 
disbursement vouchers and copies of contracts/POs had already been noted in the previous 

year’s audit report; however, the prior year’s audit recommendations were still not 

implemented. We consistently made follow-ups on the submission of the reports and 

records but due to lack of personnel and the COVID-19 pandemic, Management was not 

able to comply with the deadlines set by laws, rules and regulations relative thereto. 

 

162. The analysis and review of the agency’s financial records and documents were not 
undertaken on time, thus, preventing the Audit Teams to establish the validity of the 

underlying transactions; and forfeiting the benefit of, among others, timely detecting errors 

and deficiencies, identifying areas for improvement, and having input to assessments of 

accountability and decisions that need to be made. 

 

163. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require the Accounting Unit to submit immediately to the Audit Team the 
CY 2020 transaction records and financial reports;  

 

b. Require all the concerned officials to, henceforth, religiously comply with 
the pertinent rules and regulations on the submission of financial 

reports/records and copies of all contracts, purchase orders including all 

supporting documents to the Audit Teams;  

 

c. Require the Quality Management System Change Management Team to 
fast-track the assessment of the number of plantilla positions needed in the 

respective delivery units of the agency and request for plantilla positions 

from DBM, if warranted; and 

 

d. Coordinate with the Government Accountancy Sector of the Commission 
on Audit for the installation of the e-NGAS to facilitate preparation of 

financial reports. 

 

Management Comments: 
 

164. NTC-CO Management commented that they are trying their best to comply with 
the submission of financial reports with the current plantilla. Planning, Finance and 

Management Branch and Administrative Branch have been discussing to hire a consultant 

for the Rationalization Plan of NTC. Currently, all vacant positions had been filled up and 

Management is planning to have a Rationalization Plan after five years. Management is 

also considering the installation of the e-NGAS and the conduct of relevant trainings 

thereon. 

 

165. CAR Management explained that the delay in the submission of the Benchmarking 
contract was due to the supporting documents of the contract which were sent only by the 

Ad hoc BAC (Benchmarking Project) on December 6, 2020, thus, the delay of 211 days.  

The Benchmarking Project was a joint project of several regions in Luzon.  Moreover, the 



81 

 

contracts of the JO personnel were delayed because requirements such as medical 

certificates and National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Clearances were belatedly 

submitted by the JOs, thus, notarization was also delayed.    

 

166. Management assured us that they will do their best to institute measures to improve 
their performance. 

 

Deficiencies noted in the procurement process and implementation of contracts 

 
167. Procedural deficiencies in the procurement process of ROs V, VI, VII, XI and 
XII for their various projects were not in keeping with pertinent provisions of 

Republic Act No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), 

thus, depriving the government of the most advantageous prices and resulting in 

delays in project completion. 

 

168. Review of contracts and Purchase Orders entered into by the NTC-ROs IV, V, VI, 
VII and XI disclosed deficiencies summarized in Table 17. 

 

Table 17. Summary of Deficiencies in the Procurement Process and Implementation of Contracts 

NTC Office Deficiencies Amount Involved Standard/Criteria 

RO V The procurement of Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment was 
made from private suppliers instead of the 
Department of Budget and Management –

Provisions of the FY 2020 General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) 

RO VI Procurement of various ICT Equipment amounting to 
₱1.257 million, using Shopping as an alternative 
mode of procurement 

1,256,780.00  Annex H of the 2016 Revised IRR of

RO VII The Agency failed to impose Liquidated Damages of 
P7,721.04 for the delayed delivery of ICT Equipment 

7,721.04 Item 3, Annex D of the 2016 
Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations of Republic Act 9184. 

RO XII The Procurement of the NTC fixed and mobile 
broadband benchmarking system totaling 
₱13,200,000.00 remained unfinished despite the 
expiration of contract time, thus, items procured 
cannot be used immediately by the agency, exposing 
the same to technological obsolescence 

13,200,000.00 MOA entered into by and between 
the NTC RO XII and the DOST-
ASTI executed on June 18, 2018 

TOTAL  P15,243,481.04  

 

169. Review of the transactions pertaining to the procurement of ICT equipment of RO 
V showed that a total of ₱778,980.00 was purchased from suppliers other than the PS. 

Browsing on the website of the PS disclosed that among the items procured, laptop and 

desktop computers are included in the list of the common-use supplies and equipment being 

sold by the PS. Hence, procurement of said equipment from the private suppliers runs 

counter to the requirement of the GAA. 

 

170. Audit disclosed that four (4) Purchase Orders (POs) dated June 16, 2020, of RO VI 
amounting to ₱1,256,780.00 were awarded to suppliers for the procurement of various ICT 

Equipment of NTC RO VI using Shopping as an alternative mode of procurement. 



82 

 

However, abstract of quotations relative to these documents showed that the number of 

replies to the Requests for Quotations (RFQ) received by the Procuring Entity within the 

deadline did not reach the required number of quotations. No other details as to the number 

of extensions of the deadline and mandatory review conducted by the BAC were disclosed. 

Despite not meeting the criteria set in the IRR, the above-mentioned POs were still granted 

to the only responsive suppliers.  
 

171. In RO VII, post-audit revealed that an amount of ₱7,721.04 liquidated damages 
were not imposed on the payment for the procurement of five (5) sets desktop computers 

in spite of their delay in delivering the items. 

 

172. RO XII and the Department of Science and Technology - Advanced Science and 
Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) entered into a contract for the development of a fixed 

and mobile broadband benchmarking system. The agreement was executed on June 18, 

2018, and took effect immediately after the signing by the parties hereto. It shall remain in 

force for a period of two years, starting from the date of receipt of the project funds from 

the NTC. The project should have already been delivered on December 05, 2019, and 

completed on December 05, 2020. However, the project is still unfinished after its 

completion date. 

 

173. Considering that RO XII and DOST-ASTI are both committed to address the 
expected changes and evolution of broadband access, the internet and related technologies, 

the immediate use of the technology is important to avoid technological obsolescence 

which may minimize its cost. It can be done through planning and programming, design, 

construction, operations, maintenance and renewal. These measures or actions will 

generally minimize the impact of obsolescence and may anticipate or accommodate 

changes that may cause obsolescence before the cost of obsolescence become substantial. 

 

174. The delay in the completion of projects deprived the agency of the early usage of 
the system and defeated the purpose of the fund where the project was appropriated. 

 

175. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require the Procurement Office to abide by the rules embodied in the GAA 
that ICT equipment shall be procured from the DBM-PS; 

 

b. Ensure that at least three RFQs are sent to suppliers of known 
qualifications and at least three price quotations are received prior to the 

validation of the technical, legal and financial capability of the responsive 

suppliers and prior to the awarding of contracts/purchase orders and 

extend the deadline of the submission of the price quotations in case the 

number of quotations received did not reach the number required in the 

IRR; 

 



83 

 

c. Impose liquidated damages for late deliveries to prevent suppliers from 
neglecting their responsibility in the conditions of the contract and to avoid 

delay in the implementation of plans, projects and targets;  

 

d. Henceforth, direct the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to ensure that 
all procurement activities are conducted in accordance with the 2016 

Revised IRR of RA 9184 and are duly supported with valid documents; 

and 

 

For RO XII 

 

e. Demand from the implementing agency concerned (DOST-ASTI) the 
immediate delivery of the items procured to lessen the impact of 

technological obsolescence before the cost of obsolescence become 

substantial. 
 

Management Comments: 

 

176. RO VI Management explained in a letter reply dated January 11, 2021, written by 
the BAC Vice Chairman that this had been an unintentional typographical error on their 

part during the preparation of the BAC resolution. They intended to procure the equipment 

through Small Value Procurement but the encoder erroneously typed shopping. 

 

177. RO VII Management commented that the delay in the delivery is due to the 
cancellation of in-person classes in favor of on-line classes by the Department of Education 

(DepEd) which initially announced that school year 2020-2021 will start on the 24th of 

August 2020. As a consequence, the demand for laptop computers, desktop computers, 

tablets and other related gadgets have tremendously increased. Supplies could not meet the 

demands. This prompted the national government to prioritize the needs of the students for 

their on-line classes. As a result, the supplier asked NTC-7 to delay the delivery of the five 

(5) sets of Desktop Computers to give way to the needs of the students for their on-line 

classes. Furthermore, the supplier of laptop computers, desktop computers, tablets and 

other related gadgets experience difficulty in transporting the items due to the COVID-19 

pandemic. Out of sympathy and consideration, the imposition of liquidated damages for 

the delay in the delivery of computers will be heartless and pointless. In this time of 

pandemic, every Filipino should exercise compassion and understanding to the plight of 

others so that we can move forward to win against this pandemic. 

 

178. RO XII Management commented that they have already reiterated their request for 
the status of the transfer of ICT Equipment to be used by the NTC-RO XII. In an email 

sent by the DOST-ASTI on March 3, 2021, they explained that the delivery of the 

equipment has just recently passed by the BAC’s approval on the selection of courier. 

Management also sent a demand letter from the OIC of DOST-ASTI for an explanation on 

the delay of delivery of the equipment and the completion of the project. Management 

assured the Audit Team of the regular monitoring of the project. 

 



84 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

179. If the RO VI Management’s explanation on this matter is true, the fact that these 
BAC resolutions for a number of transactions were already signed, attached to the DVs and 

submitted to the Audit Team clearly showed that these items were not thoroughly reviewed 

prior to the approval, which is an indication of a weakness in the internal control placed in 

their procurement and disbursement process. 

 

180. We further recommended that the persons-in-charge of approving the BAC 
resolutions shall review the documents prior to signing them as approved. The Accountant 

shall also review the completeness and propriety of the supporting documents attached to 

the claims prior to signing the Accountant’s Certification in the DVs. 

 
181. In RO VII, while we recognize the reason cited by Management, it may be 
emphasized that the terms of delivery must be specified in the contract or purchase order, 

with the delivery schedule, inclusive of the duly granted time extensions. The supplier shall 

be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, 

in case the supplier fails to deliver satisfactorily within the specified delivery schedule, as 

stated in Item 3, Annex D of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of 

Republic Act 9184. 

 

Inefficient management of cash allocations 

 

182. Lapsed Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) in ROs VIII and IX in the amount 
of ₱15,134,485.48 and ₱4,979,032.29, respectively, were reverted to the National 

Treasury as at December 31, 2020, as a result of improper planning and forecasting, 

thus, affecting the optimal fund utilization and the timely implementation of the 

projects/programs/activities of the agency. 

 

183. DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 was issued to ensure the 
timely implementation of programs and projects, disbursement authorization documents 

are issued to make cash available within the scheduled program/activity/project 

implementation period as reflected in the corresponding DBM-evaluated Monthly 

Disbursement Programs (MDPs) submitted by agencies.  

 

184. Item 2.1 thereof provides that all NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-accounts, to 
be credited for any amount, whether part of the comprehensive releases, shall continue to 

be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter covered.  It further 

provides under Item 2.3 that all NCA balances of regular MDS Sub-Accounts at the end of 

each quarter are considered lapsed after the last working hour of said quarter. 

 

185. We observed in ROs VIII and IX the ineffective cash management which resulted 
in the non-implementation of projects and unnecessary reversion of unutilized NCA 

balances to the National Treasury.

186. In RO VIII, only ₱12,503,514.52 or 45.24 percent was utilized out of the total cash 
allocations received by the agency of ₱27,638,000.00, thus, a total of ₱15,134,485.48 or 

54.76 percent was reverted to the National Treasury.  

 

187. Verification of the approved Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of RO VIII showed, 
a Benchmarking Project, an Information and Communications Technology Software and 

Equipment with an estimated budget of ₱12,090,000.00 was scheduled to be procured for 

CY 2020 through public bidding. The corresponding cash allocation of the allotment for 

the project was released to the agency during the fourth quarter of the year. According to 

the Accountant, the allocation was not utilized because the public bidding on the planned 

procurement conducted by the BAC of NTC RO III per Memorandum issued by the NTC 

Central Office failed due to non-compliance by the bidder on the specifications of the 

project.  Since the conduct of bidding was made in December 2020, a re-bidding in the 

same year would be impossible due to time constraints. Thus, cash allocations intended for 

the above-mentioned project/capital outlay was reverted to the National Treasury. 

 

188. Moreover, it was observed that the prepared APP did not indicate the schedule of 
the procurement activities of such project.  Likewise, the Procuring Entity did not avail of 

the   Early Procurement Activity (EPA), as authorized in Section 19 of RA 11465, GAA 

of FY 2020, with guidelines set forth under GPPB Circular No. 06-2019, to ensure the 

timely delivery of goods.  Thus, in case a failure of bidding occurs, the conduct of a re-

bidding would still be possible with the availability of time.   

 

189. As a result, the project was not implemented and the benefits that could have been 
derived therefrom were not achieved due to delayed procurement. 

 

190. In addition, the agency was not able to conduct the monitoring activity among radio 
and telecommunication dealers starting on the second quarter of the year as part of their 

regulatory and supervisory mandate involving public telecommunications, due to 

environmental limitations caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, thus, funds allocated for 

these activities were also reverted to the National Treasury. 

 

191. RO IX received a total cash allocation of ₱31,028,020.00, of which the amount of 
₱4,979,032.29 had lapsed and was reverted to the National Treasury. The reverted amount 

represents the unutilized cash allocation mostly for Capital Outlay projects not 

accomplished during the year due to the pandemic and non-participation of prospective 

bidders, thus, the unaccomplished activities may have impact on the overall operations of 

the agency. 

 

192. The afore-cited conditions are indicative of ineffective monitoring of disbursement 
and inadequate cash management.  Had the agency effectively monitored and managed its 

cash allocations and disbursements, they could have maximized the utilization of the 

government resources provided to them. 

 



86 

 

193. The reversion of NCAs to the National Treasury also indicates that the Monthly 
Disbursement Program (MDP) prepared by Management may not be realistic or not in sync 

with the timelines set or there was inadequate procurement planning.  

 

194. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Formulate realistic and attainable work plan in the Annual Work Program 
to ensure that projects/procurements are ready for implementation upon 

receipt of cash allocations; 

 

b. Require the concerned officials to indicate in the APP the schedule of 
procurement/implementation of the project in order to achieve proper 

timing of procurement and to avoid time limitations in the conduct of the 

procurement activity; and 

 

For RO VIII 

 

c. Avail of the EPA, as authorized in Section 19 of RA 11465, GAA of FY 
2020, with guidelines set forth under GPPB Circular No. 06-2019, to ensure 

the timely delivery of goods; and henceforth, coordinate with the BAC of 

NTC RO III to undertake the procurement of the goods, and with the 

Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in order to operationalize 

the project. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

195. RO VIII Management explained that the Benchmarking Project would also involve 
participation of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in order to 

operationalize the project; hence, its implementation is not dependent on NTC alone. 

 

196. RO IX Management commented that prospective bidders for one of the projects 
came from Metro Manila since there were no capable bidders in the region. However, due 

to the cancellation of flights and courier services, bidders were not able to participate. 

Likewise, the procurement of motor vehicle was not pursued due to the issuance of DBM 

National Budget Circular No. 580 which prescribes the guidelines on the adoption of 

economy measures in the government. Management is still requesting from the DBM if 

they can continue with the procurement since Management has not yet received any 

negative Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) from them. According to Management, 

NTC Central Office is still negotiating with the DBM for the continuing appropriation. If 

the negotiations will be successful, it is expected that the procurement will be done during 

the 3rd quarter of 2021. Lastly, the procurement of Rapidly Deployable Communications 

System was scheduled for the 4th quarter of 2020. The BAC was able to conduct post-

qualification process before year-end but was only able to receive a softcopy of the 

additional documents required from the winning bidder through email, which prevented 

the completion of the procurement process. Thus, the reversion of the allotted funds for the 

project.

Defective and Unserviceable Forfeited Portable Radios, Base and Cellphones 

 

197. Three hundred eighty five (385) defective and unserviceable forfeited portable 
radios, base and cellphones reported/included in the Report on the Physical Count of 

Forfeited/Confiscated Radio Communications Equipment as at December 31, 2020 

stored in the Monitoring Room of the NTC-RO IV were not disposed of in accordance 

with existing guidelines, which exposed the items to further deterioration and hazard.  

 

198. For the efficient and effective enforcement of radio laws, rules and regulations, 
pursuant to RA 3846 (Radio Control Law) and RA 7925 (Public Telecommunications 

Policy Act) and to ensure that all radio stations are operating within the limits of its issued 

licenses and permits, physical inspections are conducted by the Enforcement, Licensing 

and Operations Division of NTC Region IV which is carried out through a Mission Order 

signed by the Regional Director.  

 

199. Memorandum Circular No. 11-21-88 dated November 21, 1988 was issued to 
govern the authorization, installation and operation of Personal Radio service for the 

orderly, efficient and effective utilization of the radio frequency spectrum and to serve 

short distance communication needs of qualified persons and small business entities. 

Among the provisions cited in the said Circular are the applications, basic and technical 

requirements, rules to govern the operation and the administrative sanction which states 

that violation of laws, rules and regulations, permits/licenses and/or certificates issued by 

this Commission shall subject any grantee to the imposition of a fine and/or the 

cancellation/suspension of its authorization and/or forfeiture of the equipment involved. 

Any person who is not a holder of any of the permits/licenses and/or certificates issued by 

this Commission shall be subjected to the imposition of fines and the confiscation and 

forfeiture of any illegal radio found in his possession or operation, in addition to such other 

sanctions provided for by the law 

 

200. On the other hand, Memorandum Circular No. 03-03-97 dated March 12, 1997, was 
issued to set the guidelines for the Disposal of Forfeited Radio Communications Equipment 

and its Accessories pursuant to Office Order No. 32-10-96 dated October 10, 1996, to wit:  

 

1.  The Disposal Committee pursuant to Office Order No. 32-10-96 shall 

undertake the disposal of all forfeited communications equipment and 

accessories of the Commission.  

 

2.   A certified list of all forfeited equipment to include the particulars of the 

equipment such as brand, type/model, serial no and condition of 

equipment from all regional offices and central office shall be submitted 

every fifteenth day of June and December to the Disposal Committee.  

 

3.  The disposal shall be in accordance with section 503 of the Government 

Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM) through sale, barter or 

transfer, the buyer, barterer or transferee must be qualified to buy and 



88 

 

possess radio equipment subject matter of the sale, barter or transfer, 

under Philippine Laws and NTC Rules and Regulations.  

 

4.  The proceeds from the sale of the disposed equipment and accessories 

shall be deposited in a trust fund to be used by the Commission, in 

accordance with law.  

 

In the inspection and verification of the Report on Physical Count of Forfeited/Confiscated 

Radio Communications Equipment as of December 31, 2020 submitted by the Legal 

Officer and the designated Custodian of these forfeited radio communications equipment, 

we found out that a total of 385 was not only defective and unserviceable but are corroded 

and tarnished.  

 

201. Moreover, these forfeited radios are stored in the cabinets in the Monitoring Room 
found to be congested and posed to further deterioration and hazard if not disposed 

immediately. Although Disposal Committee and Disposal guidelines were issued in the 

years 1996 and 1997 these was not being practiced at present, thus these forfeited radios 

was left stored for a longer period.  

 

202. We recommended and the RD of RO IV agreed that they should coordinate 
with the NTC-CO to issue updated disposal guidelines on these forfeited radios; 

otherwise, use the existing guidelines so that these can be disposed immediately to 

prevent further deterioration and hazard. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

203. RO IV acknowledged the observation and agreed to comply with the 
recommendation.  They will coordinate with the CO for the clarification on the disposal of 

these forfeited radio communication equipment. 

 

Expired Radio Station Licenses 

 

204. A number of radio operators/dealers in ROs III, VI and VIII have expired 
licenses/permits as at December 31, 2020, contrary to the provisions of NTC’s 

Department Order No. 11 implementing Republic Act (RA) No. 3846. While the 

expiration of issued certificates, permits and licenses of NTC-RO IV cannot be timely 

and properly monitored and identified due to the absence of Database Management 

and Monitoring system. 

 

205. The NTC, pursuant to RA 3846, an Act pertaining to the General Rules and 
Regulations regulating the construction, installation, establishment or operation of radio 

stations and the possession or ownership, construction or manufacture, purchase, sale and 

transfer of transmitters or transceivers in the Philippines, as amended, is mandated to 

provide regulations to all telecommunications services in the country.  The Act empowers 

the Commission to regulate the construction, manufacture, possession, control, sale and 



89 

 

transfer as well as the establishment, use, operation of all of radio, broadcast and 

telecommunications services; accreditation of Radio Maritime Training Institutions. 
 

206. Section  2 of NTC Department Order No. 11 dated October 10, 1950 provides that 
no person, firm, company, association or corporation shall possess or own radio 

transmitters or transceivers (combination transmitter-receiver), without registering the 

same with the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, nor sell or transfer the same 

to another without his prior approval, and no person, firm, company, association or 

corporation shall construct or manufacture, or purchase radio transmitters or transceivers 

without a permit issued by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications. Section 14 

thereof states that if renewal of a station license is desired, the licensee shall submit an 

application two months before the expiration date of license to be renewed. 
 

207. Review of the records disclosed the following data on expired licenses and permits 
as at December 31, 2020: 

 
Table 18. Summary of Expired Licenses/Permits  

Office No. of Expired Licenses/Permits 

RO III 134 

RO VI 804 

RO VIII 10,168 

 

208. In RO III, 134 licenses/permits or 12.84 percent of the 1,044 licenses/permits issued 
are already expired. According to the Chief Engineer of Licensing, EOD, inspections are 

conducted and reports are being turned over to the Legal Officer for appropriate action 

including the filing of administrative cases. Moreover, the said division had already sent 

Show Cause Order and filed Proper Administrative Cases with penalties to the concerned 

companies relative to their expired permits/licenses and required the immediate renewal of 

the subject licenses/permits with additional surcharges in order for them to continue their 

operations legally.  
 

209. The RD of RO VI explained that the entire NTC does not have a uniform and/or 
centralized database system to monitor the issued Radio Station Licenses (RSLs), so the 

regional offices took the initiative to design their own database. In the case of NTC-RO 

VI, one of the Engineers-in-Charge in the Licensing Unit volunteered to design a simple 

database system. This system is currently used in their daily operations and was proven to 

be useful. The Engineer-in-Charge explained that this database is still subject to the 

following limitations due to the lack of sufficient manpower, particularly Information 

Technology (IT) personnel who are considered as experts in this field: 

 

a. Encoded data may not be complete/updated. Data prior to CY 2015 were not 
included in the system and the extension of the validity period of some RSLs 

were not updated in the system. 

 

b. The database could only generate a list of RSLs, which are still valid as of a 
particular year. It could not automatically generate a list of all expired licenses. 



90 

 

Based on this list, however, a manual tracing may be conducted within database 

to verify if a particular RSL was renewed or a verification of the existing 

records kept by the Records Officer may also be conducted. 

 

c. There might be multiple entries found for one specific RSL, since they are 
encoding entries in the database as it occurs. It is very possible that one entry 

for new application, one entry for renewal and so on can be found within the 

database. Therefore, the total number of valid licenses for a given period may 

only pertain to the number of entries made and not exactly the number of valid 

licenses. 

 

d. Some RSLs may pertain to radios, which were already broken/lost/replaced but 
no permit for storage was applied for them, hence, they appeared as expired in 

the system.  

 

e. Some RSLs, most especially those that were issued for portable radio 
equipment, aircrafts and ships, may appear expired in the database, but this 

could have been renewed in NTC Offices in other regions. 

 

210. Verification of the 829 samples of RSLs from the RO VI database disclosed that 
804 RSLs have already expired for at least one (1) month to five (5) years, as at December 

31, 2020. Further, 557 of the expired RSLs were issued to various Government Agencies. 
 

211. The RD of RO VI, the Acting Chief Engineer and the Engineer-in-Charge also 
confirmed the existence of the expired RSLs but the total number and amount collectible 

cannot easily be quantified due to the limitations of the current database maintained by 

NTC-RO VI; hence, the RO conducts control measures to increase the rate of collectability 

of the fees and surcharges for the expired licenses. However, due to the COVID-19 

pandemic, the aforementioned activities were temporarily halted. 
 

212. As a result of these efforts, RO VI was also able to collect surcharges from CYs 
2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 amounting to ₱1,839,771.00, ₱1,555,306.50, 

₱1,789,722.00, ₱2,021,231.00 and ₱611,437.00, respectively. 

 

213. The RD of RO VI also expressed the following concerns/constraints regarding the 
implementation of these activities: 

 

1. Most of the letters sent through the post office, notifying the grantees/radio 
operators with expired RSLs of the expiration of their licenses, did not reach 

the intended recipients. Most, if not all, were sent back to the Regional Office. 

This was due to the fact that some of the grantees/radio operators are residing 

in far flung areas/barangays which made it difficult for the postman to locate 

them. 

 

2. Availing the services of other couriers such as LBC, JRS, LIBCAP and the like, 
may not be cost-effective in the long run considering the number of expired 

RSLs. 



91 

 

 

3. The budget for postage on the average was only around ₱5,000.00 but the 
expenses incurred for postage may be higher than the actual amount they can 

collect. 

 

4. While the conduct of mobile licensing increased the collections of NTC-RO VI, 
the prospects of conducting this in the near future is still uncertain. 

 

5. Lack of manpower, as they gave more priority to the collection of the Spectrum 
Users Fee (SUF) from Telecommunications companies. This is another form of 

income, which comprised the biggest portion of their annual income. For CY 

2020, the total Service and Business Income recorded by NTC-RO VI 

amounted to ₱148,514,503.86. Of this amount, ₱126,167,443.00 or 84.95 

percent was collected from the SUF while the remaining ₱22,347,060.86 or 

15.05 percent was collected from their other sources of income, including the 

licensing fees and surcharges. 

 

6. Aside from the measures taken by the NTC-RO VI to increase the collectability 
of the income from expired licenses, the collectability is still primarily 

dependent on the will of the grantee. 

 

214. We commended the RO VI Management for taking the initiative in creating a 
database for the monitoring of the RSLs and for implementing the above-mentioned 

measures to increase the rate of collectability of the income earned from the expired 

licenses, despite the constraints identified.  

 

215. In RO VIII, out of the 18,567 issued licenses, permits and certificates to operate 
and/or own as radio and mobile telecommunication dealer or user, 10,168 or 54.76 percent 

have already expired and were not applied for renewal due to travel restrictions of the 

inspection and monitoring team to visit their establishments and issue a SOA to enforce 

renewal of these licenses; thus, proliferation of users or dealers with expired 

licenses/permits may be rampant in the region and fees due to the government may not be 

realized, to increase national revenue.  
 

216. On the other hand, expiration of issued certificates, permits and licenses of RO IV 
cannot be timely and properly monitored and identified due to the absence of Database 

Management and Monitoring system that can be used to monitor these issued certificates, 

permits and licenses. They managed to create a Master List for each category, however, 

some of these may not be updated because of the voluminous files and records as well as 

lack of personnel.  

 

217. From the renewal of applications for CY 2020, RO IV generated a total additional 
income of ₱775,053.04 for fines and penalties for the renewal of applications beyond the 

expiration date.  
 

218. Moreover, regular inspection of telecommunication companies, radio stations 
(private and Government) maritime ship stations, radio and mobile phone dealers/retailers 



92 

 

for the expired permits, licenses and certificates was not done regularly due to lack of 

manpower in the Enforcement, Licensing and Operations Division. Usually, inspection in 

a certain area is conducted if they received a letter request from the Central Office and /or 

complaint with request for investigation/inspection.  

 

219. The agency could have effectively monitored their issued certificates, permits and 
licenses if they have a database management system wherein it could filter the expiration 

of the issued permits, certificates and licenses. Likewise, it could be also a basis for the 

Enforcement, Licensing and Operations Division in the conduct of inspection to determine 

compliance with the existing radio laws, rules and regulations. 

 

220. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require its concerned officers to determine the status and conditions of the 
operations of the operators with expired licenses and permits in order to 

enforce its renewal and collection of appropriate fees, fines and penalties; 

and  
 

b. create a Database Management and Monitoring System to monitor 
expiration of the issued permits, certificates and licenses, and would 

prompt the conduct of inspection and enforcement of renewal utilizing the 

available manpower until additional positions are installed. 
 

 

Other Compliance Issues 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

   

221. Five (5) Regional Offices (ROs) failed to allocate at least five percent (5%) of 
their total appropriations for their GAD plans while RO VIII had no reported data 

on its GAD budget and accomplishments.  

 

222. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 
states that all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development 

(GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate 

and implement the applicable provisions under RA 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 

Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing 

Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) 

and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). It also provides that the GAD Plan shall 

be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent 

(5%) of their budgets for activities which relate to GAD. For this purpose, activities 

currently being undertaken by agencies which shall relate to GAD or those that contribute 

to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, 

protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-

responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.  

Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators 



93 

 

identified by said agencies. The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and 

Budget (GPB) and annual GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be subject to the 

guidelines issued by the agencies concerned. 

 

223. The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) of NTC, with an allocated GAD Fund of 
₱51,270,224.00 or nine percent (9%) of its appropriation of ₱569,858,000.00 for FY 2020 

to GAD programs, activities and projects (PAPs), has been reviewed by the Philippine 

Commission on Women (PCW), endorsed through the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring 

System (GMMS).  

 

224. Overall, the NTC’s consolidated GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 
reported expenditures totalling ₱32,846,915.62 or 5.76 percent of the NTC’s 

appropriations for CY 2020 of ₱569,858,000.00. Individually, however, some ROs were 

not able to allocate at least five percent (5%) of their appropriations for GAD, as shown in 

Table 18. 
 

Table 18.  NTC ROs with insufficient GAD budgets and accomplishments   

 

225. RO VIII failed to submit its own GPB and accomplishment report. The consolidated 
GAD Accomplishment Report showed the budget and accomplishments of the NTC ROs 

nationwide but it did not show which accomplishments pertained to the CO. This precluded 

the Audit Team from evaluating whether the agency complied with existing laws and 

regulations on gender and development, particularly on the setting aside of at least five 

percent (5%) of its total appropriations, and whether its plans, programs, projects and 

activities on GAD are aligned to its mandate, the GAD funds were used for the purpose for 

which they have been budgeted, among others. 

 

226. The low utilization rate of the GAD Budget per RO showed the non-
implementation/attainment of the projects/ objective of the GAD PAPS, thereby, depriving 

the beneficiaries with the maximum benefits that could have been derived from the 

program. 

 

227. We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned GAD 
Focal personnel to ensure that PAPs identified in the GAD Plan are undertaken 

within the target period and the allocated budget fully utilized to maximize the 

benefits that may be derived from the projects addressing the identified gender issues 

and concerns within the agency.

Programs and Projects on Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

 

228. Five (5) ROs had not fully complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions 
of the FY 2020 GAA intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs. 

 

229. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that all agencies 
of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as its relates to their mandated functions, and integrate 

the same in their regular activities. It further requires that all government infrastructure and 

facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of the persons with disability pursuant 

to Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 344 and RA 7277.   

 

230. For CY 2020, ROs I, III, VI, X, and XII failed to allocate funds or formulate plans, 
programs, activities and projects that would enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of the 

SCs and PWDs.   

 

231. We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the requirements 
in the GAA of FY 2020 to allocate funds and formulate plans, program, project that 

address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability and integrate the 

same in their regular activities. 

 

Management Comments: 
 

232. RO X Management commented that in response to the recommendation, 
Management has submitted the Proposed Budget for 2020 with the Plans and Programs for 

Senior Citizens and PWDs. Said proposals were already presented to the Regional 

Development Council, Region X which was thereafter endorsed by the latter for approval. 

They also commented that some required provisions in compliance with RA 10717 and 

Joint Circular of DBM and DSWD already existed. 

 

Compliance with other Mandatory Accounts 
 
233. Table 19 shows the status of compliance by the NTC with pertinent tax laws, 
deduction, and remittance of premiums/contributions and loan instalments for the GSIS, 

PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG as well as insurance of all insurable assets with the General 

Insurance Fund for CY 2020.
