OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Understatement of the Building and Other Structure  
 

1. The Building and Other Structure Account was understated by a net amount 
of ₱39,656,145.11,  and overstatements of the Repairs and Maintenance – 

Building and Structure by ₱11,057,723.56, Accumulated Surplus by 

₱37,693,421.55, and the  related Accumulated Depreciation by  ₱8,640,250.00 

due to a) carrying amount of a demolished building not derecognized from the 

books for non-submission of the IIRUP; and b) cost of retrofitting of the  LBP 

Building I, administered and managed by OP, was inadvertently recognized as 

Repairs and Maintenance – Building and Other Structure in the books. 

 

The Building and Other Structure account was understated due to the 

following noted deficiencies: 

 

a)  Cost of a demolished building not derecognized in the books  

 

Section 40, Chapter 10 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I 

states that a PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing 

the entity with future economic benefits or service potential. Also, all unserviceable 

property shall be reported in the IIRUP, PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be 

dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss – PPE.  

 

Review of the Report on Physical Count of Property Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE) and Subsidiary Ledger of the Building account as at December 31, 2020 

revealed that a fully depreciated building, the Lualhati Mansion House, located in 

Baguio City. This building was acquired sometimes in December 1958, with an 

acquisition cost of ₱9,095,000.00 and a carrying amount of ₱454,750.00, was 

demolished on August 13, 2020.   

 

On February 4, 2019, OP requested for COA to witness the physical count of 

its properties located in Baguio City and in July 8, 2019, a member of the audit 

team witness the same. On February 27, 2020, OP requested the audit team to 

witness the actual demolition of the said building, however due to the pandemic, 

the actual demolition was done in August 13, 2020 where the Audit Team witness 

the same virtually. Said demolition was done to give way to the construction of the 

two-storey building renamed the OP Guest House.  

 

Verification disclosed that the said building was not derecognized in the 

books due to the non-submission of the IIRUP by the AMO to the Accounting 

Office, which is the basis for the derecognition of the building in the books of 

accounts, thus overstating the Building and Other Structure account by 

₱9,095,000.00 and its corresponding Accumulated Depreciation by ₱8,640,250.00. 



34 

 

 

b)  inadvertent recognition of the cost of retrofitting of the LBP Building I  

 

Section 3, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I states that the cost of an item of PPE 

shall be recognized as asset if and only if: 

a. It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. The cost of the fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c. Beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
d. The asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 
e. It meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000. 

 

Likewise, Section 24, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I provides that repairs and 

maintenance primarily maintain or improve the functionality and capacity of the 

PPE; increase its service life; improve the quality of its output; or reduce the 

operating cost. These may be categorized as major repair, which shall be added to 

the carrying amount of the PPE and shall be depreciated over the remaining life of 

the PPE, while minor repairs, shall be directly charged to expense account “Repairs 

and Maintenance” of the specific PPE.  

 

Further, Section 25, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I provides that betterments 

are enhancement to the future economic benefits or service potential of a capital 

asset, such as: 

 

a. An increase in the previously assessed physical output or capacity; 
b. A reduction in associated operating costs; 
c. An extension of the estimated useful life; or 
d. An improvement in the quality of output. 

 

RA No. 7656 or “An Act Requiring GOCCs to Declare Dividends Under 

Certain Conditions to the National Government and for Other Purposes” was 

passed into law on November 9, 1993, and its corresponding Implementing Rules 

and Regulations (IRR) was revised on January 26, 2016. Section 5 (e) thereof 
provides that GOCCs may declare dividends, upon obtaining DOF approval for its 

declaration which shall execute and deliver in the name of the Treasurer of the 

Philippines the necessary deed of transfer or other instrument of conveyance in 

favor of the NG. Moreover, Section 8 of the same Revised IRR provides, among 

others, that the BTr shall record the property dividends as assets upon receipt of the 

property and, upon the sale of the property, income to the General Fund. 

 

However, the revised IRR does not provide a specific guidelines on the 

recording of the future cost of the assets conveyed to the NG as property dividends, 

including any cost that may extend the life of these assets, incurred by the assigned 

government agencies to administer and manage the same.  

 



35 

 

Pursuant said RA, on January 10, 2011, a deed of absolute transfer was made 

and executed by and between the LBP and the Republic of the Philippines, acting 

through the DOF, the former being the transferor of a parcel of land situated along 

Sen. Gil Puyat St. Avenue covered by TCT No. 457062, commonly known as LBP 

Building 1, through the declaration of the Property, including the improvement 

thereof, as dividend in favor of the National Government (NG).  

 

The transfer was made to achieve the objectives of Proclamation No. 1864 

issued on August 24, 2009, assigning the LBP Building 1 to the Department of 

Foreign Affairs (DFA) and designating the same as the common premises of the 

United Nations (UN). However, due to security and administrative requirements of 

the UN, it was not accepted by the latter. Hence, Proclamation No. 1864 was 

repealed by Proclamation No. 1233 dated March 29, 2016 transferring the 

administration and management of the said building from DFA to the OP, pending 

determination of the appropriate agency which shall occupy the same. 

 

In compliance with the revised IRR of RA 7656, per verification from the 

BTr the acquisition including its related accumulated depreciation was recognized 

in its books with a carrying amount of ₱2,147,950.00 as of December 31, 2020. 

 

Relative to the issuance of Proclamation No. 1233, on March 14, 2019, the 

OP entered into contract with the Abesco Construction Development Corporation 

for the strengthening/retrofitting of the LBP Building 1, with an initial project cost 

of ₱44,346,342.62. As of December 31, 2020, the total cost of the project totaled 

₱48,751,145.11, including the additional variation order cost of ₱4,404,802.49. 

 

Review of pertinent documents showed that the total cost of ₱48,751,145.11 

for the retrofitting of the LBP Building account showed that the total cost was 

recognized under the Repairs and Maintenance – Building and Other Structure in 

CYs 2019 and 2020, details are as follows: 

 

JEV No. JEV Date Details Amount (₱) 

2019-10-007481 Oct. 1, 2019 Set up of payable for first billing 11,763,162.24 

2019-10-008611 Oct. 15, 2019 Set up of payable for second billing 14,451,676.09 

2019-12-010980 Dec. 27, 2019 Set up of payable for third billing 11,478,583.22 

Sub-Total for CY 2019 37,693,421.55 

2020-01-002479 1/3/2020 Set up of payable for fourth billing 5,132,075.40 

2020-11-06423 11/3/2020 Set up of payable for final billing 5,925,648.16 

Sub-Total for CY 2020 11,057,723.56 

         Grand Total 48,751,145.11 

 

Inquiry with the Chief Accountant disclosed that the transaction was recorded 

as Repairs and Maintenance – Building and Other Structures due to lack of 

documents as basis of ownership of the building.  

 



36 

 

However, verification of the Obligation Request and Status (ORS) showed 

that the budget object code was for capital outlay under general administration and 

support. Hence, it is the budget from which the fund was derived from Capital 

Outlay. 

 

The cost incurred for the strengthening/ retrofitting of LBP Building I 

satisfies the criteria for the recognition/capitalization of a PPE as provided in 

Section 25, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I and criteria for repair, betterment, 

enhancement, expansion or upgrade of existing PPE. This likewise results in an 

effective increase in the future economic benefits or service potential that is 

expected to be derived from using the asset. Coupled with the budget sourced of the 

fund to finance the said retrofitting, hence, the total cost should have been 

capitalized or recognized under the Building and Other Structure account. 

 

Due to the lack of pertinent provision on the recognition of future cost of the 

property dividends assigned to agencies under the revised IRR of RA No. 7656, the 

cost of strengthening/retrofitting of the LBP Building I was inadvertently 

recognized under the Repairs and Maintenance – Building and Other Structure. 

This resulted in the understatement of the Building and Other Structures account by 

₱48,751,145.11 and overstatement of the Repairs and Maintenance – Buildings and 

Other Structures account by ₱11,057,723.56 and Accumulated Surplus account by 

₱37,693,421.55.  

 

The net effect of the failure to drop from the books the carrying amount of  

₱454,750.00 of the demolished Lualhati Mansion House, and the inadvertent 

recognition of the cost of retrofitting of the LBP Building I totaling  ₱48,751,145.11 

is the understatement of the Building and Other Structure accounts by 

₱39,656,145.11, and overstatements of the Repairs and Maintenance – Building and 

Structure by ₱11,057,723.56, Accumulated Surplus by ₱37,693,421.55, and its 

related Accumulated Depreciation by  ₱8,640,250.00. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a)  require the AMO to submit the IIRUP on the Lualhati Mansion House to 

the Accounting Office for the dropping from the books of accounts its 

carrying amount; 

 

b)  coordinate with the DOF on the proper accounting treatment of the cost 

of retrofitting/strengthening and other major repairs of assets received as 

property dividends recorded in the books of the BTr; and 

 

c) require the Chief Accountant to recognized in the books of accounts the 

cost of retrofitting/strengthening of the LBP Building 1, derived from the 

budget for capital outlay of the OP, while waiting for the reply of the 

DOF. 

 



37 

 

 

Overstatement of Training expense 
  
2.   Disbursements in the total amount of ₱1,372,650.22 for the SPW for CY 2020 

that were cancelled due to COVID 19 travel restrictions that may still be 

rescheduled and/or refunded, were recognized as direct expenses upon 

liquidation by the SDO, thereby understating the asset account and 

overstating training expenses account for the same amount.  

 

Conceptual framework for General Purpose Financial Reporting by public 

sector entities under the PPSAS provides that under the Accrual basis of accounting 

transactions and other events are recognized in financial statements when they 

occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 

transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records and recognized in 

the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  

 

Financial statements prepared under the accrual basis of accounting inform 

users of those statements of past transactions involving the payment and receipt of 

cash during the reporting period, obligations to pay cash or sacrifice reporting date 

and changes in those obligations and resources during the reporting period. 

Therefore, they provide information about past transactions and other events that is 

more useful to users for accountability purpose and as input for decision making 

than in information provided by the cash basis or other bases of accounting or 

financial reporting. 

 

SPW is a yearly activity conducted by each Office under the OP. It seeks to 

establish and communicate the overall goals of the Office for the current year to its 

personnel and to develop plans to achieve such goals. It’s also a way to strengthen 

the communication of the participants, learn new skills and gain insights within the 

team. The expenditure needed for the completion of SPW shall be chargeable 

against the funds of Office conducting it. It includes among other, transportation 

costs, hotel/venue accommodation costs, and materials and supplies expenses.   

 

Accordingly, SDO would then be appointed to facilitate the disbursement of 

said funds. The SDO shall be accountable for the disbursement and liquidation of it 

within the timeframe and in accordance with existing budgeting, accounting, and 

auditing rules and regulations. 

 

On March 16, 2020, the President announce the implementation of enhance 

community quarantine (ECQ) which prohibits, among others, mass gatherings and 

all means of public transport. It was implemented throughout the   country from 

March 17, 2020 and extends until May 15, 2020 with some exceptions. 
Consequently, travel restrictions made it impossible to conduct the aforementioned 

activity. 

 

Verification of the liquidation reports of the SDOs and the corresponding 

general ledger showed that training expenses account included the disbursements, 



38 

 

of the cost of hotel and accommodation and cost of travel for SPW, which were 

cancelled or put on hold due to the ECQ restrictions, to wit:

       Total 1,372,650.22 

 

The audit team has sent a query to the Office of the Deputy Executive 

Secretary for Finance and Administration (ODESFA) dated February 15, 2021, 

intending to ascertain the plans and future actions pertaining to the rescheduling 

and refunding of cancelled transactions due to the ECQ. In its response, documents 

showed that cancelled airfare/accommodations for the SPW can still be refunded 

and/or rescheduled for the new SPW. 

 

Since the aforementioned disbursements were still not consummated yet and 

the OP intends to avail for services paid in advance, outright recognition of the 

training expenses account is not aligned with the principle of accrual basis of 

accounting. As a result, the training expense account was overstated and an asset 

account was understated by ₱1,372,650.22 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief 

Accountant to adjust the unutilized training expenses and recognize an asset 

account instead the advances made for the SPW could still be rescheduled 

and/or refunded by the concerned establishments. 

 

 

Unreverted dormant payables 
 

3. Overstatement of the Other Payables account by ₱5,437,839.87 due to the non-

reversion of the dormant payable accounts for more than two to fourteen 

years to the Accumulated Surplus as required under Section 1 of EO No. 87, 

series of 2019.  

 

Section 1 of EO No. 87, series of 2019 provides that all documented accounts 

payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of 

Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts 

payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual 



39 

 

administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic 

reversion. 

 

Verification showed that various items in Other Payable account totalling 

₱5,437,839.87 had been dormant for two to fourteen years. These items pertain to 

adjustment/reclassification in subsidiary ledger of various individuals, unclaimed 

salary of consultants and contract of service, unclaimed honorarium, reimbursement 

of cash advances and cancelled checks of which no replacement was made. 

 

Aging of dormant payables is summarized in the table below. 

Age  Amount (₱) 

more than 2 years but less than 5 years 2,578,030.84 

more than 5 years but less than 8 years                    1,176,393.04  

more than 8 years but less than 10 years                       454,560.39  

more than 10 years to 14 years                    1,228,855.60  

Total 5,437,839.87 

 

EO No. 87, s. 2019 directs that all accounts payable which remain 

outstanding for two years or more in the books of National Government Agencies 

be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the 

cumulative result of operations of the National Government.  

 

Maintaining and keeping these items in the books of accounts without 

exerting actions to settle the obligations defeats the objectives of EO No. 87, s. 

2019, which seeks to facilitate the preparation of transparent, accountable and 

realistic disbursement and annual expenditure programs. As provided in the same 

EO, the accounts payable from prior years needs to be reexamined and kept at 

manageable levels, and the actual cash requirements therefor needs to be 

ascertained.  

 

Thus, review, analysis and reconciliation should be made onto these accounts 

with consideration of EO No. 87, s. 2019 and revert those items found to be 

revertible into the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to revert the dormant payables to Accumulated Surplus in 

accordance with EO No. 87, series of 2019.
