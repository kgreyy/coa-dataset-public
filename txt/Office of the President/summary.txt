D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the OP for the CY 2020.  

The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed 

on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, 

rules and regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and       

d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with the International Standards 

of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 
 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the 

presentation of the financial statements of OP as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned, 

details of which are discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and 

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 
 

1. The Building and Other Structure Account was understated by a net amount of 
₱39,656,145.11,  and overstatements of the Repairs and Maintenance – 

Building and Structure by ₱11,057,723.56, Accumulated Surplus by 

₱37,693,421.55, and the  related Accumulated Depreciation by  ₱8,640,250.00 

due to a) carrying amount of a demolished building not derecognized from the 

books for non-submission of the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP); and b) cost of retrofitting of the  Land Bank 

of the Philippines (LBP) Building I, administered and managed by OP, was 

inadvertently recognized as Repairs and Maintenance – Building and Other 

Structure in the books. 

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a)  require the Asset Management Office (AMO) to submit the IIRUP on the 

Lualhati Mansion House to the Accounting Office for the dropping from the 

books of accounts its carrying amount; 

 

b)  coordinate with the Department of Finance (DOF) on the proper accounting 

treatment of the cost of retrofitting/strengthening and other major repairs of 

assets received as property dividends recorded in the books of the Bureau of 

Treasury (BTr); and 

 



v 

 

c) require the Chief Accountant to recognized in the books of accounts the cost 

of retrofitting/ strengthening of the LBP Building 1, derived from the budget 

for capital outlay of the OP, while waiting for the reply of the DOF. 

 

2. Disbursements in the total amount of ₱1,372,650.22 for the Strategic Planning 

Workshop (SPW) for CY 2020 that were cancelled due to COVID 19 travel 

restrictions that may still be rescheduled and/or refunded, were recognized as 

direct expenses upon liquidation by the Special Disbursing Officer (SDO), 

thereby understating the asset account and overstating training expenses 

account for the same amount.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant to 

adjust the unutilized training expenses and recognize an asset account instead 

the advances made for the SPW could still be rescheduled and/or refunded by 

the concerned establishments.  

 

3. Overstatement of the Other Payables account by ₱5,437,839.87 due to the non-

reversion of the dormant payable accounts for more than two to fourteen years 

to the Accumulated Surplus as required under Section 1 of Executive Order 

(EO) No. 87, series of 2019. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to 

revert the dormant payables to Accumulated Surplus in accordance with EO 

No. 87, series of 2019. 

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 15 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, 10 were implemented and 5 were not implemented. The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
