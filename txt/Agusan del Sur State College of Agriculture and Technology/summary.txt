Issuances of supplies and 
materials to the various offices of 
ASSCAT in December were not 
recorded as of year-end as the 
Report of Supplies and Materials 
Issued (RSMI) was not 
immediately prepared and 
submitted by the Supply Office to 
the Accounting Office while 
issuances of certain inventories in 
the previous years were still not 
taken up in the books of accounts 
due to lack of supporting 
documents, inconsistent with the 
pertinent provisions of Chapter 8 
of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
thus, existence and accuracy of the 
inventory accounts totaling 
₱4,497,775.83 were deemed 
doubtful. 

• Instruct the Supply Officer to 
immediately prepare and 
submit the RSMI to the 
Accounting Office in order 
for the Accountant to be able 
to record the issuances of 
supplies and materials;

Proceeds from the sale of bid 
documents for the procurement of 
various projects of the College for 
CYs 2020–2021 were 
inadvertently treated as business 
income while payment for the 
honoraria of the BAC and TWG 
was inappropriately recorded as an 
expense, inconsistent with Item 
No. 6.2 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A, 
thus overstating the Income from 
Printing and Publication account 
by ₱440,500.00, the Other 
Professional Services account by 
₱145,500.00, and the 
Accumulated Surplus account by

Trust Liabilities account by 
₱345,000.00, thereby ultimately 
affecting the fair presentation of 
the said accounts in the financial

inappropriate journal entries 
related to the collection of 
proceeds from the sale of bid 
documents and the payment 
of the honoraria to the BAC

the sale of bid documents 
shall be recorded under the

The leave credit balances of 19 
employees who availed the

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
A. Introduction 
 
1. The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology (ASSCAT), 

formerly Southern Agusan National Agricultural College (SANAC), was 
established through Republic Act No. 7932 offering more collegiate courses. As 
mandated by its Charter, ASSCAT shall primarily provide higher professional, 
technical and special instructions for special purposes and promote research and 
extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in agriculture, 
education, forestry, fishery, engineering, arts and sciences, and other fields as may 
be relevant. 
 

2. The audit was conducted in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, and the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions 
(ISSAIs). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a 
reasonable basis for our conclusions. 

 
3. The audit covered the accounts and operations of the ASSCAT for Calendar Year 

(CY) 2020 and was aimed at ascertaining the propriety of financial transactions, 
Management’s compliance to prescribed rules and regulations and the fairness of 
the presentation of the financial statements. Value for money audit was also 
conducted on the implementation of the infrastructure projects as to whether the 
objectives of the program were attained in the most efficient, effective and 
economical manner. 

 
 
B. Financial Highlights 
 
4. The financial condition, results of operations and the sources and applications of 

funds for CY 2020 with comparative figures for CY 2019 are shown below.

C. Audit Opinion 
 
5. The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 

financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the following 
matters: 
 
a. The amount billed to Commission on Higher Education - Unified Student 

Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (CHED-UniFAST) for the 
Tuition and Other School Fees of students who enrolled in ASSCAT for the first 
and second semesters of Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 and first semester of 
AY 2020-2021 totaling ₱76,903,518.50 was determined to be erroneous and had 
remained unadjusted in the books of accounts of the College due to the 
programming errors in their enrollment system that generated inaccurate data; 
 

b. Issuances of supplies and materials to the various offices of ASSCAT in 
December were not recorded as of year-end as the Report of Supplies and 
Materials Issued (RSMI) was not immediately prepared and submitted by the 
Supply Office to the Accounting Office while issuances of certain inventories in 
the previous years were still not taken up in the books of accounts due to lack of 
supporting documents, thus, existence and accuracy of the inventory accounts 
totaling ₱4,497,775.83 were deemed doubtful; and 
 

c. Proceeds totaling ₱490,500.00 from the sale of bid documents for the 
procurement of various projects of the College for CYs 2020–2021 were 
inadvertently treated as business income while payment for the honoraria of the 
Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and Technical Working Group (TWG) was 
inappropriately recorded as an expense. 

 



iii 

6. For the foregoing audit observations which have caused the issuance of a qualified 
opinion, we recommended the following: 

 
a. Direct the Management Information System Office to hasten the process of 

resolving the identified errors in order to be able to issue the corrected 
Certificates of Registration of the enrollees and prepare the proper billing 
statements so as to claim the correct amount of fees from CHED-UniFAST. 

 
Moreover, instruct the Accountant to prepare the appropriate adjusting journal 
entry to correct the journal entries made for the billing statements issued for the 
said three semesters and furnish this Office a copy of the related journal entry 
voucher. 

 
b. Instruct the Supply Officer to immediately prepare and submit the RSMI to the 

Accounting Office in order for the Accountant to be able to record the issuances 
of supplies and materials. 

 
Henceforth, require the Supply Officer to prepare the RSMI at the end of each 
day when there are issuances pursuant to Section 16, Chapter 8 of the GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I. 

 
Moreover, direct the Accounting Office to acquire other available documents to 
support the issuance of the said inventories in the previous years in order 
reconcile the balance of the inventories account in the books of accounts with 
the records of the Supply Office. 

 
c. Direct the Accountant to make the proposed adjusting journal entry to correct 

the inappropriate journal entries related to the collection of proceeds from the 
sale of bid documents and the payment of the honoraria to the BAC and TWG 
out of the said proceeds. 

 
Henceforth, ensure that proceeds from the sale of bid documents shall be 
recorded under the Trust Liabilities account until its purpose is fulfilled, with 
any excess thereof remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury, while payment of the 
honoraria to the BAC and TWG out of the said proceeds should not be treated 
as an expense of the College, pursuant to Item No. 6.2 of DBM BC No. 2004-
5A. 
 

D. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 
7. The other significant audit observations and recommendations are as follows: 

 
a. Various expenses related to several activities conducted by the College totaling 

₱616,202.12 were erroneously recorded and charged to the Other Maintenance 
and Operating Expenses account. 
 



iv 

Instruct the Accountant to properly classify expenditures and record them in the 
appropriate accounts in accordance with the revised chart of accounts in the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume III, in order for the expense accounts to be fairly 
presented in the financial statements. 
 

b. Prior year’s expenses totaling ₱1,028,266.06 were erroneously recorded in the 
books of accounts as current year’s expenses. 

 
We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to ensure that 
expenses should be properly recorded in the book of accounts in the year that 
they relate to in order to fairly present the financial statements of the College. 
 
Furthermore, instruct the Accountant to take up the proposed accounting entry 
in the books of accounts to correct the balances of the affected accounts. 

 
c. COVID-19 Hazard Pay aggregating ₱82,500.00 was granted to 24 personnel 

without the required authority to physically report for work during the 
implementation of Enhance Community Quarantine (ECQ) while certifications 
from the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) certifying the number 
of days the personnel physically reported for work did not completely coincide 
with the data in the related Daily Time Records (DTRs), thus, the validity and 
propriety of the payment of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay totaling ₱572,500.00 
could not be completely ascertained and the amount paid to the 24 personnel 
constituted irregular expenditures disallowable in audit. 

 
We recommended that Management require the identified personnel in Annex D 
to submit to the Office of the Auditor the authority granted to them to physically 
report for work during the implementation of the ECQ from the College 
President, otherwise, demand the full restitution of the respective amounts 
claimed. 
 
We also recommended that Management instruct the heads of each office to 
strictly and thoroughly review the DTRs and other reports prepared by their 
subordinates in order to avoid the foregoing circumstances. 

 
d. Salary differentials and RATAs of the designated SUC Vice Presidents of 

ASSCAT in CY 2020 aggregating ₱2,537,963.39 were inadvertently charged 
against the PS appropriations under the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 GAA instead of 
against the available PS allotments, thus caused the PS deficiency at year-end 
thereby precluding the College from paying personnel benefits totaling 
₱2,517,469.00 to its employees. 

 
We recommended that Management stop the practice of directly charging the 
salary differentials and RATAs of the designated SUC Vice Presidents against 
the PS Appropriations and strictly follow the provisions of the GAA in the 
utilization of funds. 



v 

e. The practice of the College in the distribution of financial assistance to the 
intended student beneficiaries aggregating ₱49,276,500.00 in the form of cash 
through the cash advances of the Disbursing Officer instead of electronic fund 
transfer was determined to be ineffective and inefficient in view of the risks and 
dangers that the practice entailed and the benefits provided by the available 
electronic fund transfer systems. 

 
We recommended that Management require each student receiving benefits or 
allowances from the various Student Financial Assistance Programs to open an 
ATM Savings Account, as encouraged under Item No. 18 under Section 8.3.1(d) 
of the CHED-DBM-DSWD and DOLE Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01 
dated June 23, 2016, to lessen the burden on the Disbursing Officer and 
eliminate the identified risks and danger. 

 
 
E. Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 
8. The Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges which 

summarizes the total audit suspensions, disallowances and charges for the 
transactions covering the period January 1 to December 31, 2020, issued by the 
Commission, showed a balance of ₱413,788.70 for unsettled suspensions and a 
balance of ₱1,621,571.60 for unsettled disallowances as of December 31, 2020. 
 

9. Moreover, the Report on Notices of Suspension, Notices of Disallowance, and 
Notices of Charge issued prior to the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts (Annex 9, COA Circular 2009-006) showed a balance of ₱2,389,811.13. 

 
 
F. Statement on the quantity/number of audit recommendations implemented, 

partially implemented and not implemented for the current year. 
 
10. Out of the 39 audit recommendations embodied in CY 2019 and prior years’ 

Annual Audit Reports, 16 audit recommendations were fully implemented, 20 were 
partially implemented, and three were not implemented.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
 
HON. PERFECTO A. ALIBIN 
Chairperson, Board of Trustees 
Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology 
Bunawan, Agusan del Sur 
 
 
Qualified Opinion 
 
We have audited the financial statements of the Agusan del Sur State College of 
Agriculture and Technology (ASSCAT), Bunawan, Agusan del Sur which comprise the 
Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial 
Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flows and 
Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and 
Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting 
policies.  
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Bases of Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of ASSCAT as at December 31, 2020, and its 
financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts 
for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting 
Standards (IPSAS). 
 
Bases for Qualified Opinion 
 
The following matters formed part of the bases of our opinion: 
 
• The amount billed to CHED-UniFAST for the Tuition and Other School Fees of 

students totaling ₱76,903,518.50 was determined to be erroneous and had remained 
unadjusted in the books of accounts of the College due to the programming errors in 
their enrollment system that generated inaccurate data. 

 
• Issuances of supplies and materials in December were not recorded as of year-end as 

the RSMI was not immediately prepared and submitted by the Supply Office to the 
Accounting Office while issuances of certain inventories in the previous years were 
still not taken up in the books of accounts due to lack of supporting documents, thus, 
existence and accuracy of the inventory accounts totaling ₱4,497,775.83 were 
deemed doubtful.

Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology 
Notes to Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2020 
 
1. General Information/Agency Profile 

 
The financial statements of Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and 
Technology (ASSCAT) were authorized for issue on February 11, 2021 as shown in 
the Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by        
Joy C. Capistrano, the College President. 
 
The registered office of the College is Bunawan, Agusan del Sur. It has an External 
campus situated in Trento, Agusan del Sur which was turn over by the LGU of Trento 
on August 1, 2015 and was accepted by the Board of Trustee pursuant to BOT 
Resolution No. 33, series of 2015. 
 
The ASSCAT started as a Manobo Industrial School in 1908 offering primary education 
especially to the Manobos of Upper Agusan, with the authority from the Commission 
on Higher Education during the American regime headed by Mr. Dean C. Worcester. 
Acting Governor Gen. William Cameron Forbes granted 42.0853 hectares school site 
through Executive Order No. 52. In 1927, it became the Bunawan Agricultural High 
School by virtue of Education Act of 1927 with additional 280.813-hectare school 
reservation. The establishment was temporarily closed when World War II broke in 
1941. After the war in 1948, the school was re-opened and renamed as Bunawan 
National Agricultural Junior High School under R.A. 301. Five (5) years later, it was 
changed to Bunawan National Agricultural School (BUNAS) under R.A. 948 of 1953. 
 
Pursuant to RA No. 5917, the school was converted into Southern Agusan National 
Agricultural College (SANAC) on June 21, 1969. It offered two-year Agricultural 
Technician Curriculum through DECS Circular No. 8 on the 2nd semester, 1974-75. The 
ladderized-type Bachelor of Agricultural Technology was authorized by DECS Order 
No. 66 on June 23, 1987, followed by the offering of the Bachelor of Secondary 
Education (BSEd) major in Technology and Home Economics (THE) and Bachelor of 
Elementary Education (BEEd) with Work Education as field of concentration through 
DECS Order No. 88, s. 1992.  
 
On March 1, 1995, the school was converted into a state college known as ASSCAT by 
virtue of RA 7932. The College is mandated to primarily provide higher professional, 
technical and special instructions for special purposes and to promote research and 
extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in agriculture, 
education, forestry, in-land fishery, engineering, arts and sciences, and other relevant 
disciplines. It shall continue to offer undergraduate and graduate courses primarily in 
the processing of agricultural products and; to provide opportunities to the most

Funds from Other Agencies. 
 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1. Basis of accounting 
 

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with 
the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 

 
3.2. Financial instruments 

 
a. Financial assets 

 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
Financial assets within the scope of IPSAS 29 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair value 
through surplus or deficit, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The 
Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology (ASSCAT) 
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a 
time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace 
(regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the 
College commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
 
The ASSCAT’s assets include: cash and short-term deposits; trade and other 
receivables; loans and other receivables, inventories, prepayments and other 
current assets. 
 
Subsequent measurement 
 
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit 
 
The financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit include financial 
assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through surplus and deficit. Financial assets are 



13 
 

classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling 
or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated 
embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are 
designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value 
through surplus or deficit are carried in the statement of financial position 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in surplus or deficit. 
 
Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial 
measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized 
cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Amortized cost is 
calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Losses 
arising from impairment are recognized in the surplus or deficit. 
 
Derecognition 
 
ASSCAT derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and 
Technology of similar financial assets when: 
• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or is waived 
• ASSCAT has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset 

or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party; and either: (a) The College has 
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or (b) 
ASSCAT has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 

 
Impairment of financial assets 
 
ASSCAT assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence 
that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial 
asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events 
that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss 
event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows 
of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably 
estimated. 
 
Evidence of impairment may include the following indicators: 
• The debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial 

difficulty 
• Default or delinquency in interest or principal payments 



14 
 

• The probability that debtors will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganization 

• Observable data indicates a measurable decrease in estimated future 
cash flows (e.g. changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults) 

 
Financial assets carried at amortized cost 
 
For financial assets carried at amortized cost, ASSCAT first assesses 
whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial 
assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets 
that are not individually significant. If the College determines that no 
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed 
financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of 
financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively 
assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for 
impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, 
recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.  
 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the 
amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding 
future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred). The present 
value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s 
original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the 
discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective 
interest rate. 
 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance 
account and the amount of the loss is recognized in surplus or deficit. Loans 
together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no 
realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realized or 
transferred to the Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and 
Technology. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated 
impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss 
is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-
off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to finance costs in surplus or 
deficit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



15 
 

b. Financial liabilities 
 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IPSAS 29 are classified as financial 
liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and borrowings, 
as appropriate. ASSCAT determines the classification of its financial 
liabilities at initial recognition. 
 
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case 
of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
 
ASSCAT financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank 
overdrafts, loans and borrowings, financial guarantee contracts. 
 
Subsequent measurement 
 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification. 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit include financial 
liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial 
recognition as at fair value through surplus or deficit. 
 
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for 
the purpose of selling in the near term. 
 
This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the 
Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships 
as defined by IPSAS 29. 
 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in surplus or 
deficit. 
 
Derecognition 
 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, 
and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in 
surplus or deficit. 



16 
 

3.3. Cash and cash equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank, deposits on 
call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or 
less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to 
insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the consolidated 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
 

3.4. Inventories 
 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 
inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a 
nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 
 
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are 
accounted for, as follows: 

• Raw materials: purchase cost using the weighted average cost method 
• Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and labor and 

a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating 
capacity, but excluding borrowing costs 

 
After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net 
realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is distributed 
or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of inventory is 
measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. 
 
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution.  
 
Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 
consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the College. 
 

3.5. Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets the 
characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 
• tangible items; 
• held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to 

others, or for administrative purposes; and 



17 
 

• expected to be used for more than one reporting period. 
 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 
• It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 

with the item will flow to the entity; and 
• The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 
Measurement at Recognition 
 
An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. 
 
A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value 
as at the date of acquisition. 
 
The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through 
non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date. 
 
Cost includes the following: 

• Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

• expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 
• initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 

restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity 
incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used 
the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce 
inventories during that period. 

 
Measurement after Recognition 
 
After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.   
 
When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be 
replaced at intervals, ASSCAT recognizes such parts as individual assets with 
specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major 
repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the 
plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or 
deficit as incurred.  
 
Depreciation 
 
Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is 
significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 
 



18 
 

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in 
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management. The College depreciates the asset after the 
PPE is issued to the end-user with reference to the Acknowledgement Receipt 
of Equipment (ARE). 
 
For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for 
one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. 
However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, 
depreciation is for the succeeding month. 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight line method of depreciation is adopted since it is more appropriate 
for agency operation. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The ASSCAT uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by 
classification prepared by COA. 
 
The ASSCAT uses a residual value equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the cost 
of the PPE. 
 
Impairment 
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 
recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable service amount. 
 
Derecognition 
 
The ASSCAT derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or any 
significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
or service potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the 
surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized. 
 
 
 



19 
 

3.6. Changes in accounting policies and estimates 
 
The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology recognizes 
the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The effects of 
changes in accounting policy are applied prospectively if retrospective 
application is impractical. 
 
The College recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates 
prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 
 
The College correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set 
of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by: 
• Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 

the error occurred; or 
• If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the 

opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest 
prior period presented. 

 
3.7. Revenue from non-exchange transactions 

 
Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in-
kind, that meets the definition of an asset are recognized as an asset if the 
following criteria are met: 
• It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 
• The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 
An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at 
its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
 
Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset 
is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized 
in respect of the same inflow. 
 
As Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology satisfies a 
present obligation recognized as a liability in respect of an inflow of resources 
from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset, it reduces the carrying 
amount of the liability recognized and recognize an amount of revenue equal to 
that reduction. 
 
 



20 
 

Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the 
increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding liability 
is recognized. 
 
Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange 
Transactions 
 
The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the best 
estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
date. 
 
Taxes  
 
Taxes and the related fines and penalties are recognized when collected or when 
these are measurable and legally collectible. The related refunds, including 
those that are measurable and legally collectible, are deducted from the 
recognized tax revenue. 
 
Fees and fines not related to taxes 
 
The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology recognizes 
revenues from fees and fines, except those related to taxes, when earned and the 
asset recognition criteria are met. Deferred income is recognized instead of 
revenue if there is a related condition attached that would give rise to a liability 
to repay the amount.  
 
Other non-exchange revenues are recognized when it is probable that the future 
economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the 
entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 
Gifts and Donations 
 
The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology recognizes 
assets and revenue from gifts and donations when it is probable that the future 
economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity and the fair value 
of the assets can be measured reliably. 
 
Goods in-kind are recognized as assets when the goods are received, or there is 
a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind are received 
without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If conditions 
are attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and revenue recognized 
as the conditions are satisfied. 
 



21 
 

On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind are measured 
at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained by 
reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of the value of an 
asset is normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds 
a recognized and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair 
value are ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid 
market. 
 
Transfers 
 
The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology recognizes 
an asset in respect of transfers when the transferred resources meet the 
definition of an asset and satisfy the criteria for recognition as an asset, except 
those arising from services in-kind. 
 
Services in-Kind 
 
Services in-kind are not recognized as asset and revenue considering the 
complexity of the determination of and recognition of asset and revenue and the 
eventual recognition of expenses. 
 
Transfers from other government entities 
 
Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and 
the related assets are measured at fair value and recognized on obtaining control 
of the asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the transfer is free from 
conditions and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential 
related to the asset will flow to the ASSCAT and can be measured reliably. 
 

3.8. Revenue from Exchange transactions 
 
Measurement of Revenue 
 
Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. 
 
Rendering of Services 
 
The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology recognizes 
revenue from rendering of services by reference to the stage of completion 
when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably. The stage of 
completion is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a 
percentage of total estimated labor hours. 
 
Where the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized 
only to the extent that the expenses incurred are recoverable. 



22 
 

Sale of Goods 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of 
the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is 
probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the 
transaction will flow to ASSCAT. 
Rental income 
 
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in 
revenue. 
 

3.9. Budget information 
 
The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the College’s 
website – asscat.edu.ph.  
 
As a result of the adoption of the cash basis for budgeting purposes, a separate 
Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts is presented showing 
the basis, timing or entity differences. Explanatory comments are provided in 
the notes to the annual financial statements; first, the reasons for overall growth 
or decline in the budget are stated, followed by details of overspending or 
underspending on line items. 
 
The budget figures are those approved by the governing body known as 
Program of Receipts and Expenditures (PRE) both at the beginning and 
during the year following a period of consultation with the public. The PRE is 
prepared pursuant to CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011. 
 

3.10. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
 
Impairment of cash-generating assets 
 
At each reporting date, ASSCAT assesses whether there is an indication that an 
asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment 
testing for an asset is required, ASSCAT estimates the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-
generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets. 
 
Where the carrying amount of an asset or the cash-generating unit (CGU) 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. 



23 
 

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if 
available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. 
 
For assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is 
any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer 
exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, ASSCAT estimates the 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. 
 
A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a 
change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that 
the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior 
years. Such reversal is recognized in surplus or deficit.  
 
Impairment of non-cash-generating assets 
 
ASSCAT assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a 
non-cash-generating asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the ASSCAT estimates the 
asset’s recoverable service amount. An asset’s recoverable service amount is 
the higher of the non-cash generating asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. 
 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable service amount, 
the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable service 
amount. 
 
ASSCAT classifies assets as cash-generating assets when those assets are held 
with the primary objective generating a commercial return. Therefore, non-cash 
generating assets would be those assets from which the ASSCAT does not 
intend (as its primary objective) to realize a commercial return. 
 

3.11. Related parties 
 

The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology regards a 
related party as a person or an entity with the ability to exert control individually 
or jointly, or to exercise significant influence over ASSCAT or vice versa 

 
 
 



24 
 

3.12. Employee benefits 
 
The employees of ASSCAT are member of the Government Service Insurance 
System (GSIS) which provides life and retirement insurance coverage. 
 
ASSCAT recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits, 
like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as expense unless capitalized, and 
as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 
 
ASSCAT recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when 
these are paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). Unused 
entitlements that has accumulated at the reporting date are not recognized as 
expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like special leave 
privileges, are not recognized. 
 

3.13. Measurement uncertainty 
 
The preparation of ASSCAT financial statements in conformity with IPSAS, 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the 
reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the period. Items 
requiring the use of significant estimates include the useful life of capital assets, 
estimated employee benefits, rates for amortization, impairment of assets, 
liability for contaminated sites, etc. 
 
Estimates are based on the best information available at the time of preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements and are reviewed annually to reflect 
new information as it becomes available. Measurement uncertainty exists in 
these consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these 
estimates. 

 
4. Changes in Accounting Policies 

 
The Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology adopted the 
following new accounting policies: 
 
4.1. Retrospective Application 
 

On January 1, 2014, Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and 
Technology adopted the IPSAS Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 17 to 30. The new 
standards include the requirement for recognition, measurement, presentation 
and disclosure requirements for financial reporting in the Philippines. 

 
 
 



25 
 

5. Prior Period Adjustments

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

PART II - AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 
Overstatement of Accounts Receivable, School Fees, and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit Due 
to Erroneous Billing Caused by Programming Errors in their Enrollment System 
 
1. The amount billed to Commission on Higher Education - Unified Student 

Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (CHED-UniFAST) for the 
Tuition and Other School Fees of students who enrolled in ASSCAT for the first 
and second semesters of Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 and first semester of AY 
2020-2021 totaling ₱76,903,518.50 was determined to be erroneous and had 
remained unadjusted in the books of accounts of the College due to the 
programming errors in their enrollment system that generated inaccurate data, 
inconsistent with Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus, rendering the 
Accounts Receivable, School Fees, and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts 
overstated thereby affecting the fair presentation of the said accounts in the 
financial statements. 
 
1.1. Section 4 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10931, also known as the Universal 

Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, provides that states that “All Filipino 
students who are either currently enrolled at the time of effectivity of this Act, 
or shall enroll at any time thereafter, in courses in pursuance of a bachelor’s 
degree, certificate degree, or any comparable undergraduate degree in any 
State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and Local Universities and Colleges 
(LUCs) shall be exempt from paying tuition and other school fees for units 
enrolled in: Provided, that they pass the entrance examination and other 
admission and retention requirements of the SUCs and LUCs: Provided, 
further, that all SUCs and LUCs shall create a mechanism to enable students 
with the financial capacity to pay for their education in the SUC and LUC to 
voluntarily opt out of the tuition and other school fees subsidy or make a 
contribution to the school. SUCs and LUCs must report the tuition payments 
contributions collected from these students to CHED: Provided, finally, that the 
amount required to implement the free tuition and other school fees in SUCs, 
and LUCs, shall be determined by the respective governing boards of SUCs and 
LUCs based on the projected number of enrollees for each academic year, 
which shall be the primary factor in computing the annual proposed budget of 
SUCs and, in the case of LUCs, the CHED for such purpose. This shall in turn 
serve as the baseline during the preparation of the National Expenditure 
Program by the Department of Budget and Management.” 

 
1.2. Section 15, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “The 

Financial Statements (FS) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 



43 
 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue, and expenses set out in International Public Sector Accounting 
Standard (IPSAS). The application of IPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if 
necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.” 

 
1.3. Records showed that the College sent billing statements to the CHED-UniFAST 

for the Tuition and Other School Fees (TOSF) of students who enrolled in 
ASSCAT for the first and second semesters of AY 2019-2020 and first semester 
of AY 2020-2021, pursuant to Section 4 of R.A. No. 10931, as shown in the 
table below: 
 

Date Billing Statement Reference No. Academic Year Covered 
No. of 

Enrollees Billed Amount 

09/19/19 CARAGA-ASSCAT-2019-1-1 1st Semester of A.Y. 2019-2020 5,784 ₱ 26,517,183.50 
02/20/20 CARAGA-ASSCAT-2019-2-1 2nd Semester of A.Y. 2019-2020 5,429  22,535,185.00 

10/08/20 CARAGA-ASSCAT-2020-1-1 1st Semester of A.Y. 2020-2021 6,740  27,851,150.00 

Total ₱ 76,903,518.50 

 
1.4. Verification further revealed that the College received payment for the TOSF 

for the first semester of AY 2019-2020 through fund transfer from CHED-
UniFAST on October 2, 2019  totaling ₱26,517,183.50, while the payment for 
the TOSF for the second semester of AY 2019-2020 was received through 
LDDAP-ADA No. 20-09-983 dated September 2, 2020. However, it was 
disclosed that the amount credited to the bank account of ASSCAT was only 
₱17,311,770.00 out of the ₱22,535,185.00 that was billed due to some 
discrepancies identified by the CHED-UniFAST in the billing statements for 
the first and second semesters of A.Y. 2019-2020. Details of the said 
discrepancies were shown in the Reconciliation of Billings sent by the CHED-
UniFAST to ASSCAT and are summarized below: 
 
Semester TOSF Amount Remarks by CHED-UniFAST 

First 
Development Fee ₱ 45,590.00 Billed amount exceeded the certified amount in the TOSF details Certification 

Laboratory Fee  2,885,400.00 For justification/clarification. Exceeded the Laboratory Fee per subject certified in the TOSF Details. 

Second 

Development Fee  4,400.00 Billed amount exceeded the certified amount in the TOSF details Certification 

Guidance Fee  1,700.00 Billed amount exceeded the certified amount in the TOSF details Certification 

Laboratory Fee  2,283,300.00 For justification/clarification. Exceeded the Laboratory Fee per subject certified in the TOSF Details. 
Form 2  1,500.00 Duplicate entry in Form 2 
Form 2a  1,525.00 Duplicate entry in Form 2a 

Total ₱ 5,223.415.00  

 
1.5. As shown in the foregoing table, ₱5,168,700.00 or 98.95 percent of the total 

amount pertained to laboratory fees. Review of 2,948 samples of Certificates of 



44 
 

Registration (CORs) of the enrollees in the first and second semesters of          
AY 2019-2020 revealed that laboratory fees were computed by the system at a 
rate of ₱100.00 per unit instead of at the rate of ₱100.00 per subject which is 
the rate approved by the College President. Consequently, this error had a major 
impact in the calculation of laboratory fees as most subjects with laboratory 
classes credited three to five units which meant that the amount billed for 
laboratory fees was magnified to at least three times the correct rate. 
 

1.6. Moreover, it was discovered that certain fees, such as Guidance Fee, MASTS 
Fee, Thesis Outline, and Undergraduate Thesis, were charged multiple times in 
the CORs of some students, as summarized in Annex A. 

 
1.7. Furthermore, the personnel assigned to prepare the said billing statements 

disclosed that laboratory fees for some subjects with actual laboratory classes 
were not reflected in the CORs of the enrollees who enlisted the said subjects. 

 
1.8. Interview with the Accountant revealed that the above errors were already 

disseminated to the Management Information System (MIS) Office and were 
already being worked out in coordination with the concerned faculty. 

 
1.9. Despite the presence of the above errors in their enrollment system, the data 

generated from the said system were still used by the College to prepare the 
billing statement for the first semester of A.Y. 2020-2021. Consequently, the 
billing statement was sent to CHED-UniFAST and the Accounting Office 
proceeded to record the erroneous amount in the books of account as School 
Fees and Accounts Receivable. 

 
1.10. As a result of the above circumstances, the Accounts Receivable, School Fees, 

and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts remained overstated thereby 
affecting the fair presentation of the said accounts in the financial statements. 
 

1.11. We recommended that Management direct the MIS Office to hasten the 
process of resolving the identified errors in order to be able to issue the 
corrected Certificates of Registration of the enrollees and prepare the 
proper billing statements so as to claim the correct amount of fees from 
CHED-UniFAST. 
 

1.12. We also recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to 
prepare the appropriate journal entry vouchers to correct the journal 
entries made for the billing statements issued for the said three semesters 
and furnish this Office copies of the said journal entry vouchers. 
 
 
 
 
 



45 
 

Management Comments 
 

1.13. During the exit conference, Management admitted the presence of the 
programming errors in their system and committed to fix the issues the soonest 
possible time. 
 

1.14. Moreover, the Accountant agreed to prepare the necessary adjusting journal 
entries for the Laboratory Fees once the correct amount is determined and will 
submit the same to the Office of the Auditor. 

 
 
Doubtful Inventory Accounts Due to Unrecorded Issuances of Supplies and Materials 

 
2. Issuances of supplies and materials to the various offices of ASSCAT in   

December, 2020 were not recorded as of year-end as the Report of Supplies and 
Materials Issued (RSMI) was not immediately prepared and submitted by the 
Supply Office to the Accounting Office while issuances of certain inventories in 
the previous years were still not taken up in the books of accounts due to lack of 
supporting documents, inconsistent with the pertinent provisions of Chapter 8 of 
the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus, existence and accuracy of the inventory 
accounts totaling ₱4,497,775.83 were deemed doubtful. 
 

2.1. Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the following 
guidelines: 

• Section 7 states that “When inventories are sold, exchanged, or 
distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense 
in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no 
related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are 
distributed or the related service is rendered.” 

• Section 10(b) requires that “Tangible items below the capitalization 
threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable 
property and shall be recognized as expense upon issuance to the end-
user.” 

• Sequence No. 9 under Section 16 sets out that “Supply Office should 
retrieve the original copies of the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and 
prepares the RSMI in two copies at the end of the day.” 

• Section 17(g) provides that“The RSMI shall be prepared by the 
Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used 
by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the Journal 
Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the supplies and materials issued.”

2.2. Records showed as of December 31, 2020 that the inventory accounts of the 
College had a combined balance of ₱4,497,775.83 as shown below: 
 

Inventory Accounts Total 
Office Supplies Inventory ₱ 517,311.97 
Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory  21,022.87 
Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory  55,883.78 
Agriculture and Marine Supplies Inventory  26,490.00 
Construction Materials Inventory  110,383.76 
Other Supplies and Materials Inventory  1,755,698.40 
Semi-Expendable Office Equipment  95,488.05 
Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment  33,700.00 
Semi-Expendable Other Machinery and Equipment  31,454.00 
Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures  145,100.00 
Semi-Expendable Books  1,705,243.00 

Total ₱ 4,497,775.83 
 

2.3. Review of the Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) submitted by 
the Supply Office last January 28, 2021 revealed that the College had no 
balance in its inventory accounts as of December 31, 2020 as the Supply Officer 
claimed that he had already issued all the of the purchased supplies and 
materials to the end users. 
 

2.4. Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the recording of the issuance of the 
supplies and materials was done only upon submission of the RSMI by the 
Supply Office. However, as of year-end, the last RSMI received by the 
Accounting Office reported an issuance of supplies and materials in the amount 
of ₱1,213,200.00, bringing down the balance of the inventory accounts to 
₱4,497,775.83 as reported in the year-end financial statements. 
 

2.5. Further inquiry with the personnel of the Supply Office revealed that the 
practice of their office was to prepare the RSMI only after the Accounting 
Office submits the list of purchases that was recorded at the end month in order 
for the Supply Office to determine the account codes to be used for the issued 
supplies and materials in the RSMI, which was not in accordance with Sequence 
No. 9, Section 16, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, as the said 
provision requires the preparation of the RSMI on the basis of the RIS at the 
end of the day. They also added that the supplies and materials issued in 
December 2020 was still to be prepared by their office. 
 

2.6. Moreover, the Accountant admitted that some items in the inventory accounts, 
such as the Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory and Agriculture 
and Marine Supplies Inventory, were already issued in the previous years but 
were not recognized as expenses due to lack of supporting documents, thus had 
still remained in the books of accounts as inventories. 



47 
 

2.7. Due to the foregoing conditions, the existence and accuracy of the inventory 
accounts totaling ₱4,497,775.83 were deemed doubtful. 
 

2.8. We recommended that Management instruct the Supply Officer to 
immediately prepare and submit the RSMI to the Accounting Office in 
order for the Accountant to be able to record the issuances of supplies and 
materials. 
 

2.9. Henceforth, require the Supply Officer to prepare the RSMI at the end of 
each day when there are issuances pursuant to Section 16, Chapter 8 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

2.10. Moreover, direct the Accounting Office to acquire other available 
documents to support the issuance of the said inventories in the previous 
years in order reconcile the balance of the inventories account in the books 
of accounts with the records of the Supply Office. 
 

Management Comments 
 

2.11. Management instructed the Supply Office to prepare and submit the said RSMI 
to the Accounting Office and committed to comply with the provisions of the 
GAM for NGAs. 
 

2.12. Moreover, the Accounting Office agreed to look for other available documents 
to support the issuances in the previous years in order to reconcile the balance 
of the inventories account with the records of the Supply Office. 

 
 
Incorrect Accounting Treatment of the Collection from the Sale of Bid Documents and 
Payment of Honoraria 
 
3. Proceeds from the sale of bid documents for the procurement of various projects 

of the College for CYs 2020–2021 were inadvertently treated as business income 
while payment for the honoraria of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and 
Technical Working Group (TWG) was inappropriately recorded as an expense, 
inconsistent with Item No. 6.2 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) 
Budget Circular (BC) No. 2004-5A, thus overstating the Income from Printing 
and Publication account by ₱440,500.00, the Other Professional Services account 
by ₱145,500.00, and the Accumulated Surplus account by ₱50,000.00 while 
understating the Trust Liabilities account by ₱345,000.00, thereby ultimately 
affecting the fair presentation of the said accounts in the financial statements. 

 
3.1. Item No. 3.1 of DBM BC No. 2007-3, which amends Item No. 6.1 of BC No. 

2004-5A, states that the amount necessary for payment of honoraria and 
overtime pay authorized under BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 shall be 
sourced from the following, among others: 



48 
 

3.1.1. Collections from successfully completed procurement projects 
limited, however, to activities prior to awarding of contracts to 
winning bidders: 
• Proceeds from sale of bid documents; 
• Fees from contractor/supplier registry; 
• Fees charged for copies of minutes of bid openings, BAC 

resolutions and other BAC documents; 
• Protest fees; and 
• Proceeds from bid security forfeiture. 

 
3.1.2. Savings realized from the current year specific budget of the 

agency under the General Appropriation Act (GAA). 
 

3.2. Moreover, Item No. 6.2 under DBM BC No. 2004-5A provides that “Pursuant 
to DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Resolution No. 2005-2 dated June 
2005, all agencies are authorized to treat the collections from the sources 
identified in Item No. 6.1 hereof as trust receipts to be used as exclusively for 
the payment of honoraria and overtime pay herein authorized. Agencies may 
utilize up to one hundred percent of the said collections for the payment of 
honoraria and overtime pay subject to the guidelines in Item No. 5.0 of this 
Circular. Any excess in the amount collected shall be remitted by NGAs to the 
Bureau of the Treasury.” 
 

3.3. Records showed that proceeds from the sale of bid documents for the 
procurement projects in CYs 2020–2021 aggregated ₱490,500.00 as of 
December 31, 2020 as shown in detail in Annex B and summarized below: 
 

Proceeds from the Sale of Bid Documents 
Particulars Amount 

For CY 2020 Projects (early procurement activities) Collected in CY 2019 ₱ 50,000.00 
For CY 2020 Projects Collected in CY 2020  115,500.00 
For CY 2021 Projects (early procurement activities) Collected in CY 2020  325,000.00 

Total ₱ 490,500.00 

 
3.4. Audit disclosed that the above proceeds were inadvertently recorded as 

Business Income of the College under the Income from Printing and Publication 
account. It can be inferred from Item No. 6.2 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A that the 
collections from the proceeds of the sale of bid documents should be recognized 
as a liability since these collections are supposed to be treated as trust receipts 
for the payment of honoraria and overtime pay of the BAC with the excess to 
be remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury. 
 

3.5. Audit further revealed that honoraria totaling ₱145,500.00 were already paid to 
the BAC and TWG for 11 successfully completed procurement projects of      
CY 2020 through the cash advance of the disbursing officer granted under 



49 
 

check no. 2050922 dated October 15, 2019. However, the said payment was 
incorrectly treated as an expense by debiting the said amount to the Other 
Professional Service account. The said payment should not be treated as an 
expense of the College since the source of the payment is the proceeds of the 
sale of bid documents which is supposed to be treated as trust receipts, thus, 
should have been debited directly to the Trust Liabilities account had the 
liability been properly set up when the proceeds from the sale of bid documents 
were collected. 
 

3.6. Consequently, the unutilized and unremitted balance of the proceeds of the sale 
of bid documents collected in CY 2020 aggregated ₱345,000.00 as of  
December 31, 2020 broken down as follows: 
 

Particulars Proceeds from Sale of Bid Documents 
Honoraria Paid 

in CY 2020 
Balance as of 

12/31/2020 

CY 2020 Procurement Projects ₱ 165,500.00 ₱ 145,500.00 ₱ 20,000.00 
CY 2021 Procurement Projects  325,000.00  -  325,000.00 

Total ₱ 345,000.00 

 
3.7. Moreover, the BAC and TWG were not awarded with honoraria for two 

successfully completed procurement projects of CY 2020. It is to be 
emphasized that the balance of ₱20,000.00 should be remitted to the Bureau of 
the Treasury if Management does not plan on utilizing it for the honoraria of 
the BAC and TWG for the said two successfully completed procurement 
projects, while the balance of ₱325,500.00 should be utilized as payment for 
the honoraria of the BAC and TWG only for the successfully completed 
procurement projects of CY 2021, with any excess remitted to the Bureau of 
the Treasury. 
 

3.8. In view of the foregoing deficiencies, the following accounts are 
understated/overstated as of December 31, 2020 as follows: 
 

Transaction 
Income from 
Printing and 
Publication 

Other

50 
 

3.9. As a result, the Income from Printing and Publication, Other Professional 
Services, Trust Liabilities, and Accumulated Surplus/deficit accounts are not 
fairly stated in the financial statements. 
 

3.10. We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to make the 
following proposed adjusting journal entry to correct the inappropriate 
journal entries related to the collection of proceeds from the sale of bid 
documents and the payment of the honoraria to the BAC and TWG out of 
the said proceeds: 
 

Account Name Account Code Debit Credit 
Accumulated Surplus/Deficit 30101010 345,000.00  

Trust Liabilities 20401010  345,000.00 
To correct the journal entries related to the collection of proceeds from the sale of bid documents 
and the payment of the honoraria to the BAC and TWG out of the said proceeds in CY 2020 

 
3.11. Henceforth, ensure that proceeds from the sale of bid documents shall be 

recorded under the Trust Liabilities account until its purpose is fulfilled, 
with any excess thereof remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury, while 
payment of the honoraria to the BAC and TWG out of the said proceeds 
should not be treated as an expense of the College, pursuant to Item No. 
6.2 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A. 
 

Management Comments 
 

3.12. Management acknowledged the foregoing deficiencies and committed to 
implement the foregoing recommendation. Moreover, since the books of 
accounts for CY 2020 were already closed, the appropriate adjusting journal 
entries for the incorrect recording of the collection of proceeds from the sale of 
bid documents and the payment of the honoraria to the BAC and TWG out of 
the said proceeds in CY 2020 will be made in CY 2021. 

 
 
Expenditures Inappropriately Recorded as Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses 
 
4. Various expenses related to several activities conducted by the College totaling 

₱616,202.12 were erroneously recorded and charged to the Other Maintenance 
and Operating Expenses account, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I and inconsistent with the description of the related accounts 
provided in the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, thus, although the misstatements did 
not have an adverse effect on the surplus for the period of the College, the affected 
expense accounts were not fairly presented in the financial statements. 

 
4.1. Section 15, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “The FS 

shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows 
of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects 



51 
 

of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in 
IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, 
would result in fair presentation of the FS.” 
 

4.2. Moreover, the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, which contains the revised chart 
of accounts, provides the descriptions for the following accounts as follows: 
• Training Expenses - this account is debited to recognize the costs 

incurred for the participation/attendance in and conduct of trainings, 
conventions and seminars/workshops. It includes training fees, 
honoraria of lecturers, cost of handouts, supplies, materials, meals, 
snacks and all other training related expenses; 

• Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses - this account is debited to 
recognize the costs of fuel, oil and lubricants issued for use of 
government vehicles and other equipment in connection with 
government operations/projects. 

• Representation Expenses - this account is debited to recognize the 
expenses incurred for official meetings/conferences and other official 
functions; and 

• Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses - this account is debited 
to recognize other operating expenses not falling under any of the 
specific maintenance and other operating expense accounts. 

 
4.3. Furthermore, Section 61 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that 

“Audit of the expense accounts shall be undertaken to ascertain that all 
expenses incurred have been duly authorized; adequately funded and 
documented; properly recorded; all recorded expenses have been actually 
incurred; and the classification of expenses are appropriate and have been 
consistently followed.” 
 

4.4. Audit revealed that cash advances totaling ₱897,950.00 were granted to defray 
the expenses of the following activities of the College in CY 2020: 
 

Activities Amount 
Extension Training on Techno Demo on Lacatan Banana Production and 
Management Phase 2 ₱ 50,600.00 

3rd Meeting of ASSCAT Search Committee for Presidency  83,450.00 
111th BOT Special Meeting  241,000.00 
112th BOT Special Meeting  235,500.00 
Health and Wellness cum GAD Seminar  100,000.00 
Joint Academic & Administrative Council Special Meeting  21,900.00 
Culmination of Women's Month  83,000.00 
Seminar Workshop on Customer Service Relations for Frontline Service 
Providers and GAD  34,500.00 
Orientation-Seminar on Alternative Work Arrangement, Stress Debriefing and 
Updates on Gender and Development related Issues  48,000.00 

Total ₱ 897,950.00 



52 
 

4.5. Review of the related liquidation reports disclosed that actual expenses of the 
activities added up to ₱616,202.12 and were recorded as Other Maintenance 
and Operating Expenses. However, scrutiny of the supporting documents 
revealed that the actual expenses pertained to purchases of meals, snacks, 
tokens, plane tickets, school supplies, hotel accommodation and diesel fuel to 
name a few. 
 

4.6. Pursuant to Section 61 of P.D. No. 1445 and the revised chart of accounts in 
GAM for NGAs, Volume III, the actual expenses of the activities should have 
not been charged to the Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses account as 
they should have been appropriately classified as follows:

4.7. Interview with the Accountant disclosed that the above erroneous recording was 
due to the inadvertence of the Accounting Office. Nevertheless, with the books 
of accounts already closed, he committed to properly classify the expenditures 
and record them in their appropriate accounts for future transactions. 
 

4.8. As a result, the Training Expenses account was understated by ₱293,810.65, the 
Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses account by ₱293,810.65, the Representation 
Expenses account by ₱293,203.99, while the Other Maintenance and Operating 
Expenses account was overstated by ₱616,202.12, and although these 
misstatements did not have an adverse effect on the surplus for the period of the 
College, the affected expense accounts were not fairly presented in the financial 
statements. 
 

4.9. We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to properly 
classify expenditures and record them in the appropriate accounts in 
accordance with the revised chart of accounts in the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume III, in order for the expense accounts to be fairly presented in the 
financial statements. 



53 
 

Management Comments 
 

4.10. Management acknowledged the foregoing deficiency but was not immediately 
able to correct the expenses inappropriately recorded in the Other Maintenance 
and Operating Expenses account before the books of the accounts were closed. 
 

4.11. Nonetheless, Management agreed to properly classify the expenditures into 
their appropriate accounts in accordance with the revised chart of accounts in 
the GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 
 
Erroneous Recording of Prior Year’s Expenses 
 
5. Prior year’s expenses totaling ₱1,028,266.06 were erroneously recorded in the 

books of accounts as current year’s expenses, inconsistent with Section 119 of       
P.D. No. 1445 and Section 6(b), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
thereby overstating the affected expense accounts and understating the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by the same amount. 
 
5.1. Section 119 of the P.D. No. 1445 states that “All lawful expenditures and 

obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that 
year.” 
  

5.2. Moreover, Section 6(b), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides 
that “Each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and 
operations conformably to accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the 
Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard. In relation thereto, accrual 
basis is defined in Section 2(a) of the same chapter as a basis of accounting 
under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and 
not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 
transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and 
recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.” 
 

5.3. Audit disclosed that expenses incurred in CY 2019 totaling ₱1,028,266.06 were 
taken up in the books of accounts as current expenses in CY 2020 as shown in 
Annex C and summarized in the table below: 
 

Account Name Amount 
Salaries and Wages - Regular ₱ 35,449.70 
Personal Economic Relief Allowance  3,090.91 
Transportation Allowance  9,545.45 
Traveling Expenses-Local  34,346.91 
Fuel, Oil and Lubricants  Expense  43,885.79 
Electricity Expense  151,619.38 
Communication Expenses- Mobile  15,731.17 
Other Professional Services Expense  169,251.15 
Security Services  145,424.09

Account Name Amount 
Other General Services  315,531.51 
Representation Expense  8,000.00 
Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses  96,390.00 

Total ₱ 1,028,266.06 
 

5.4. Verification further revealed that although the above expenses were already 
obligated in the previous year as presented in the Financial Accountability 
Report No. 3 as of the quarter ending December 31, 2019 of the College, the 
Accounts Payable and Due to Officers and Employees accounts were not set up 
in the books of accounts to acknowledge that the obligations were due and 
demandable and thus, the corresponding expenses were not recognized as 
incurred at the end of the year. 
 

5.5. In view of the foregoing, since the Accounts Payable and Due to Officers and 
Employees accounts were not set up in the previous year and in turn, no 
expenses were recognized, the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account should 
have been debited in the books of accounts when payments were made for the 
above expenses to correct the understatement of expenses in the previous year, 
instead of treating them as current year expenditures. 
 

5.6. Interview with the Accountant revealed that the personnel responsible for the 
recording of the transactions in the Regular Agency Fund was fairly new to the 
tasks assigned to her as the person previously in charge was transferred to the 
Supply Office of the College. Further, the Accountant admitted that he 
overlooked to thoroughly review the related journal entries. 
 

5.7. As a result of the above deficiency, the affected expense accounts were 
overstated by ₱1,028,266.06 and the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) was 
understated by the same amount. 
 

5.8. We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to ensure that 
expenses should be properly recorded in the book of accounts in the year 
that they relate to in order to fairly present the financial statements of the 
College. 
 

5.9. Furthermore, instruct the Accountant to take up the following accounting 
entry in the books of accounts to correct the balances of the affected 
accounts: 
 

Account Name Account Code Debit Credit 
Accumulated Surplus/Deficit 30101010 1,028,266.06

Management Comments 

 
5.10. Management acknowledged the foregoing deficiency and recorded the 

suggested adjusting journal entry under JEV No. 01-2020-10-1118 dated 
October 31, 2020. 
 

5.11. Furthermore, Management committed to record expenses as current in the 
books of accounts if they are incurred in the current year while prior years’ 
expenses will be recorded through the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account. 

 
 
Doubtful Documents Supporting the Payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay 
 
6. COVID-19 Hazard Pay aggregating ₱82,500.00 was granted to 24 personnel 

without the required authority to physically report for work during the 
implementation of Enhance Community Quarantine (ECQ) while certifications 
from the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) certifying the number of 
days the personnel physically reported for work did not completely coincide with 
the data in the related Daily Time Records (DTRs), contrary to Section 4 of DBM 
BC No. 2020-1, thus, the validity and propriety of the payment of the COVID-19 
Hazard Pay totaling ₱572,500.00 could not be completely ascertained and the 
amount paid to the 24 personnel constituted irregular expenditures disallowable 
in audit. 

 
6.1. Section 4 of the DBM BC No. 2020-1 states that the heads of government 

agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers 
without the need for further approval by DBM, subject to the following 
guidelines and conditions, among others: 

• The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for 
work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed 
official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period 
of implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work 
stations. 



56 
 

• The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the 
number of days an employee/worker physically reports for working 
during the Enhanced Community Quarantine period. 

 
6.2. Records showed that COVID-19 Hazard Pay were granted to 93 personnel of 

ASSCAT who were physically reporting for work at their respective offices 
during the period of implementation of ECQ measures in Agusan del Sur, 
covered by the following documents: 
 

Check/LDDAP-ADA

Total ₱ 572,500.00 
 

6.3. The above disbursements were supported with payrolls, certifications from the 
HRMO certifying the number of days the personnel physically reported for 
work during the implementation of ECQ, and copies of DBM BC No. 2020-1 
and Executive Order No. 18-20, series of 2020 issued by the Office of the 
Provincial Governor of Agusan del Sur. 
 

6.4. Audit, however, revealed that 24 employees (Annex D) listed in the payroll 
were not among those identified to physically report for work during ECQ in 
the ASSCAT Memorandum Order No. 045 dated March 25, 2020. 
 

6.5. Moreover, it was discovered upon comparison of the certifications from the 
HRMO and the manually filled DTRs of the listed personnel that the days 
certified for some personnel in the certifications did not completely coincide 
with the data in the related DTRs as shown in Annex E. 
 

6.6. Furthermore, the DTRs of some personnel who were granted with COVID-19 
Hazard Pay were assessed to be questionable due to the following: 

• The second-half of the DTRs of 27 personnel were signed by a different 
person; 

• Two DTRs had time in and out entries despite the attached supporting 
documents showing that the personnel were on a work from home scheme; 

• Some DTRs had very unrealistic entries as the time in and out were claimed 
to be  8:00 am and 5:00 pm sharp, respectively, all throughout April 2020 
and some even had time in and out entries in the holidays and weekends of 
April; and 

• Erasures of entries in the DTRs were not countersigned. 
 

6.7. Inquiry with the HRMO personnel revealed that the said certifications were 
based on the entries in the logbook for the record of attendance provided by the 
HRMO because they themselves admitted that the DTRs could not really be 



57 
 

relied upon since they were manually filled. However, inspection of the said 
logbook showed that some personnel did not input the time they signed out in 
the morning and signed in and out in the afternoon while some of the entries 
were also incomprehensible, making the said certifications doubtful as well. 
 

6.8. In view of the foregoing deficiencies, the validity and propriety of the payment 
of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to the personnel of ASSCAT could not be 
ascertained while the amount paid to the 24 personnel aggregating ₱82,500.00 
was deemed irregular in nature, therefore disallowable in audit. 
 

6.9. We recommended that Management require the identified personnel in 
Annex D to submit to the Office of the Auditor the authority granted to 
them to physically report for work during the implementation of the ECQ 
from the College President, otherwise, demand the full restitution of the 
respective amounts claimed. 
 

6.10. We also recommend that Management instruct the heads of each office to 
strictly and thoroughly review the DTRs and other reports prepared by 
their subordinates in order to avoid the foregoing circumstances. 
 

Management Comments 
 

6.11. Management submitted certifications signed by the College President which 
attested that the identified personnel in Annex D were employees of ASSCAT 
and were part of the Skeletal Workforce during the implementation of the ECQ 
in Bunawan, Agusan del Sur. 
 

6.12. Moreover, Management asserted that daily attendance was monitored and 
posted in the Matrix of Attendance prepared by the HRMO, while attendances 
that were not signified in the logbook but were reflected in the respective DTRs, 
were not considered in the certifications prepared by the HRMO. 
 

6.13. Finally, Management argued that the DTRs on the second half of April 2020 
that were submitted to the Office of the Auditor were not identical to the DTRs 
in their custody and claimed that releasing of unofficial documents to COA 
shall be treated seriously and will be subject for investigation and due process. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 
6.14. The documents that were submitted to the Office of Auditor on March 8, 2021 

will still be assessed whether it would be valid and sufficient to support the 
COVID-19 Hazard Pay claims of the subject personnel. 
 

6.15. However, the fact that the said logbook was not completely accomplished in 
good form and the details therein did not completely coincide with the entries 
in the related DTRs, made the certifications of the HRMO and the DTRs 



58 
 

doubtful, thus validity and propriety of the payment of the COVID-19 Hazard 
Pay to the personnel of ASSCAT could not be completely ascertained. 

 
 
Inappropriate Charging of Salary Differentials and Representation and Transportation 
Allowances (RATAs) to the Personnel Services (PS) Appropriations 
 
7. Salary differentials and RATAs of the designated SUC Vice Presidents of 

ASSCAT in CY 2020 aggregating ₱2,537,963.39 were inadvertently charged 
against the PS appropriations under the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 GAA instead of 
against the available PS allotments, inconsistent with Section 45 of the General 
Provisions of the said GAA and Item No. 11 of the SUC Benefits under CHED 
Memorandum No. 12, s. 2018, thus caused the PS deficiency at year-end thereby 
precluding the College from paying personnel benefits totaling ₱2,517,469.00 to 
its employees. 

 
7.1. Section 45 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA states that “The 

appropriations for PS under the FY 2020 GAA shall be used for the payment of 
personnel benefits authorized by law to be given to National Government 
personnel. Any available allotment for Personnel Services within a department 
or agency may be utilized by said department or agency for the payment of 
deficiencies in authorized personnel benefits. Implementation of the said 
section shall be subject to guidelines issued by the DBM.” 
 

7.2. Item No. 11 of the SUCs Benefits under CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, 
series of 2018, states that “SUCs may designate additional VPs in excess of the 
allowable number as may be warranted in conformance with Section 6 of R.A. 
No. 8292 provided that the funds shall be sourced from internally generated 
income or from available allotment for PS of the SUC.” 
 

7.3. Records showed that salary differentials and RATA totaling ₱2,537,963.39 
were paid to the designated SUC Vice Presidents of the College in CY 2020 as 
shown in detail in Annex F and summarized in the following table: 
 

Personnel Benefits Amount 
Salary Differential ₱ 2,092,872.63 
RATA  445,090.76 

Total ₱ 2,537,963.39 
 

7.4. Audit, however, revealed that these personnel benefits were directly charged 
against the PS appropriations of the College under the FY 2020 GAA despite 
not being specifically programmed in the said appropriations which is why Item 
No. 11 of the SUCs Benefits under CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series 
of 2018, required the charging of the said personnel benefits to the available 
allotment for PS of the agency. 



59 
 

7.5. Section 5.1.1.2 of the DBM National Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 
2020, which sets the guidelines on the release of funds under the FY 2020 GAA, 
provides that Available PS allotments released to the department or agency at 
the start of the year shall be used for the (i) original purpose of appropriations; 
and (ii) to cover PS deficiencies in Authorized Personnel Benefits. Likewise, 
Section 5.1.1.3 thereof states that the available PS allotments referred under 
Section 5.1.1.2 may be realized from unspent compensation of employees due 
to the following: 
• Incurrence of leaves of absence without pay; 
• Vacant positions on account of termination, resignation, transfer, 

retirement or separation; 
• Delay in the actual assumption of duty from the date of appoint 
• Suspension and other disciplinary sanctions; 
• Erroneous computations of PS benefits; or 
• Other similar instances. 

 
7.6. It can be inferred from the above provisions that available allotment for PS 

pertains to the savings realized by the agency as a result of the foregoing 
instances, thus, in conjunction to Item No. 11 of the SUCs Benefits under 
CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, s. of 2018, the salary differentials and 
RATAs of the SUC Vice Presidents should have been paid out of the PS 
Savings of the College and not directly charged against the PS appropriations. 
 

7.7. Furthermore, it was disclosed that Management had requested for additional 
funds in the amount of ₱2,517,469.00 from DBM to cover their PS requirement 
in December 2020 but was denied because the whole year PS requirements of 
ASSCAT was already fully funded and the PS portion of the Miscellaneous 
Personnel Benefit Fund was already fully utilized as of December 15, 2020, 
hence, the DBM could no longer accommodate any PS deficiency. 
 

7.8. As a result, the practice of the College in the charging of the salary differentials 
and RATAs of the designated SUC Vice Presidents directly against the PS 
appropriations caused the PS deficiency at year-end thereby precluding the 
College from paying personnel benefits totaling ₱2,517,469.00 to its 
employees. 
 

7.9. We recommended that Management stop the practice of directly charging 
the salary differentials and RATAs of the designated SUC Vice Presidents 
against the PS Appropriations and strictly follow the provisions of the 
GAA in the utilization of funds. 
 
 
 
 
 



60 
 

Management Comments 
 

7.10. During the exit conference, Management acknowledged the foregoing 
deficiencies and asserted that the SUC Vice Presidents had to be compensated 
in some way for the additional responsibilities that came with the designations 
as DBM does not provide funds for the personnel benefits of designations. 
 

7.11. Management nonetheless agreed to implement the audit recommendation. 
 
 
Procurement of Goods with Brand Name References 

 
8. Two hundred sixty units of various goods listed in the Project Procurement 

Management Plans (PPMPs) for CYs 2019–2020 with a total budgeted cost of 
₱3,548,140.50 included references to brand names in their specifications and 105 
of which had already been procured for a total cost of ₱1,580,673.00, inconsistent 
with Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Non-Policy Matter No. 126-
2017, thus lead to the incurrence of irregular expenditures. 
 
8.1. GPPB Non-Policy Matter No. 126-2017 asserts that “Section 18 of R.A. No. 

9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act, and its 2016 revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), mandate that reference to brand 
names shall not be allowed and thus, specifications for the goods shall be based 
on relevant characteristics and/or performance requirements. This mandate 
cannot be circumvented by setting specifications that point out only to one 
brand of goods or items, though without mentioning the name of the brand. 
What is prohibited directly is prohibited indirectly.” 
 

8.2. Review of the PPMPs of various offices of ASSCAT for CYs 2019–2020 
revealed that 260 units of various goods with a total budgeted cost of 
₱3,548,140.50 included references to brand names in their specifications. 
Moreover, as of December 31, 2020, of the said 260 units of various goods, 105 
units were already procured by the College for a total cost of ₱1,580,673.00 as 
evidenced by the presence of the signed purchase orders. A detailed schedule 
of the said goods are shown comprehensively in Annexes G and H. 
 

8.3. Interview with the Head of the Procurement Office revealed that they might 
have overlooked some of the goods with brand name references during the 
compilation of the PPMPs submitted by the various offices of ASSCAT. She 
also admitted that for some goods, especially personal computers, it was 
difficult for her and the end-users to provide the general term of the needed 
specification without mentioning a brand name.   
 

8.4. The inclusion of references to brand names in the specifications of the goods to 
be procured is clearly inconsistent with Section 18 of the Revised IRR of       
R.A. No. 9184 and defeats the very essence and purpose of competitive bidding 



61 
 

as it limits the bidders who may join and prevents other legally, technically and 
financially capable suppliers from participating in government biddings. Thus, 
the above mentioned circumstance, lead to the incurrence of irregular 
expenditures. 
 

8.5. We recommended that Management instruct the Procurement Officer to 
strictly evaluate and ensure that the PPMPs of the offices of ASSCAT do 
not contain brand name references pursuant to the rules and regulations 
set forth in R.A. No. 9184. 
 

8.6. As for goods that are difficult to provide specifications without mentioning 
a brand name, we recommended that Management direct the end-users to 
indicate in their respective PPMPs the capabilities/standards the requested 
goods must have to meet its purpose. Subsequently, during the 
procurement stage, the concerned BAC shall then evaluate the proposals 
of the bidders/suppliers vis-à-vis the required performance standards set 
out by the end-users. 
 

8.7. Management recognized their lapses in the preparation and review of the 
PPMPs of the various offices of ASSCAT and committed that compliance with 
provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its IRR in the preparation of the PPMPs will 
be strictly enforced. 

 
 
Non-observance of R.A. No. 9184 in the Selection of Venue for BOT Meetings 
 
9. The selection of the hotel for the lodging of the BOT members and venue for the 

BOT Special Meetings was not in accordance with Section 10 of R.A. No. 9184, 
while the payment of the hotel expenditures were made through the cash advance, 
inconsistent with Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-002, thus casted doubt on the 
validity and propriety of the actual hotel expenditures totaling ₱121,005.00, 
deprived the College of the assurance of selecting quality services at the most 
advantageous price, and prevented the withholding of taxes aggregating ₱7,562.81 
from the payments made to the supplier. 

 
9.1. Section 10 of R.A. No. 9184 states that “All procurement shall be done through 

competitive bidding except in certain cases where appropriate alternative 
methods of procurement may be used.” 
 

9.2. Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides, among others, that “Payments 
must generally be made by checks unless the circumstances warrant the 
difficulty, impracticability and impossibility to make such payment, thus, 
payment in the form of cash through the cash advance of the disbursing officer 
can be resorted to. It is to be emphasized, however, that payment in the form of 
cash through the cash advance shall only be resorted to when the situation 
proves to be difficult, impractical or impossible to make payments by check.” 



62 
 

 
9.3. Audit of disbursements revealed that cash advances totaling ₱476,500.00 were 

granted to an ASSCAT official to defray the expenses of the 111th and 112th 
BOT special meeting held on February 14 and 28, 2020, respectively, at Davao 
City. 
 

9.4. Audit further revealed that ₱126,500.00 or almost 27 percent of the total cash 
advances were budgeted for accommodation purposes at two separate rates as 
presented in their Activity Designs and illustrated below: 
 

Particulars 111th Meeting 112th Meeting Total 
Round-trip Plane Tickets (7 pax @ ₱20,000.00) ₱ 140,000.00 ₱ 140,000.00 ₱ 280,000.00

Total ₱ 241,000.00 ₱ 235,500.00 ₱ 476,500.00 
 

9.5. Examination of the related liquidation reports disclosed that the venue of the 
meeting was in Park Inn by Raddison Davao hotel. Furthermore, expenditures 
incurred in the said hotel aggregated ₱121,005.00 as evidenced by the following 
official receipts issued by SM Prime Holdings, Inc., Davao City:

02/28/20 29748 Additional Hotel Accommodation  11,625.00 

Total ₱ 121,005.00 
 

9.6. It was noted that the selection of the hotel for the lodging of the BOT members 
and venue of the BOT Special Meetings was not in accordance with Section 10 
of R.A. No. 9184. Moreover, the attachments of the disbursement vouchers for 
the grant of the said cash advances did not indicate how Management came up 
with the budget for the two types of accommodation at ₱4,500.00 and ₱1,000.00 
per person. Likewise, the related liquidation reports were not substantiated with 
a document showing how and why the Park Inn by Raddison Davao hotel was 
chosen as the venue for the meeting. These deficiencies prevented the Audit 
Team from ascertaining whether the budget for accommodation was reasonable 
or not and if the chosen venue was in the best interest of the College. 
 



63 
 

9.7. Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the Park Inn by Raddison Davao 
hotel was chosen as the venue of the meeting due to its close proximity from 
the airport and the area having low traffic congestion. He also admitted that due 
to the uncertainty of the attendance of some of the BOT members and that most 
hotels would require an advance payment at the time of reservation, the use of 
cash advance was their most practicable recourse. 
 

9.8. With the issuance of the GPPB Resolution No. 27-2019 dated December 10, 
2019, the rules for the use of Framework Agreement, provided under the 
attached Annex B, including the procedure in the conduct of public bidding that 
will be subject of Framework Agreement was then prescribed. This guides the 
procuring entities in the use of Framework Agreement, as a contractual 
arrangement, in the procurement of goods and services which are repeatedly 
required but by their nature, use or characteristic, the quantity or exact time of 
need cannot be accurately pre-determined. By way of “Call-Off,” the procuring 
entity may make a specific procurement request or order requiring a supplier or 
service provider to deliver the goods or render the services agreed upon under 
the Framework Agreement. 
 

9.9. Consequently, the non-observance of the procurement process under R.A. No. 
9184 casted doubt on the validity and propriety of the actual hotel expenditures 
totaling ₱121,005.00 and deprived the College of the assurance of selecting 
quality services at the most advantageous price, while the payment of the hotel 
expenditures through the cash advance prevented the withholding of 
corresponding taxes aggregating ₱7,562.81, computed as follows:

Total ₱ 121,005.00 ₱ 5,402.00 ₱ 2,160.81 ₱ 7,562.81 
 

9.10. We recommended that Management shall ensure that selection of hotel for 
the lodging of the BOT members and the venue of the BOT meetings shall 
be done through competitive bidding, as provided under Annex B of the 
GPPB Resolution No 27-2019, in order to substantiate the hotel 
expenditures, obtain quality services at the most advantageous price, and 
enable the payment through checks thereby allowing the withholding of 
the corresponding taxes.

Management Comment 
 
9.11. During the exit conference, Management agreed that selection of hotel for the 

lodging of the BOT members and the venue of future BOT meetings shall be 
done through competitive bidding, as provided under Annex B of the GPPB 
Resolution No. 27-2019. 

 
 
Emergency Purchase of Goods for an Annual Activity of the College 
 
10. Procurement for various goods aggregating ₱163,303.96 during the Year-end 

Report and Assessment activity of ASSCAT was not in accordance with the 
procurement process and payments of the same were not duly supported with 
complete documentation, inconsistent with pertinent provisions of the 2016 
Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 and Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445, thus the College 
was not assured that quality goods were obtained at its most advantageous price, 
likewise, the regularity, validity and propriety of the disbursements could not be 
ascertained. Moreover, expenses totaling ₱20,434.81 for “assorted groceries” were 
deemed unnecessary as they were not among the expenses included in the 
budgetary requirement of the activity design and the purpose for which the 
payment was made was not specified contrary to Section 4.1 of COA Circular    
No. 2012-003. 
 
10.1. Section 1 of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 states that “the said IRR 

is promulgated pursuant to Section 75 of R.A. No. 9184 for the purpose of 
prescribing the necessary rules and regulations for modernization, 
standardization, and regulation of procurement activities of the Government of 
the Philippines.” Pertinent sections contained in the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 
No 9184 are the following: 

• Section 7.1 requires that, “all procurement shall be within the 
approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously 
and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with 
government fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial 
to the efficient discharge of governmental functions shall be included 
in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). The APP shall include 
provisions for foreseeable emergencies based on historical records.” 

• Section 7.2 states that, “no procurement shall be undertaken unless it 
is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes 
thereto.” 

• Section 10 mandates that, “all procurement shall be done through 
competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI of the said IRR.” 

• Section 52.1(a) states that “Shopping may be resorted to when there 
is an unforeseen contingency requiring immediate purchase: 
Provided, however, that the amount shall not exceed thresholds 
prescribed under Annex H of the said IRR.” 



65 
 

• Section 53.2 provides that, “Negotiated Procurement shall be allowed 
in case of imminent danger to life or property during a state of 
calamity, or when time is of the essence arising from natural or man-
made calamities or other cause where immediate action is necessary 
to prevent damage to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital 
public services, infrastructure facilities and other public utilities.” 

 
10.2. Moreover, Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, 

defines unnecessary expenditures as “expenditures which could not pass the 
test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting 
non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. It would also include 
incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government. An 
expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without 
loss of damage to property is considered as unnecessary.” 
 

10.3. Audit revealed that the College conducted their Year-end Report and 
Assessment activity last December 20, 2019 the following objectives presented 
in the activity design: 
a. To present appearance of the 2019 accomplishments versus targets of the 

different units of the College; 
b. To assess the foregoing status of projects, programs and activities 

implemented by the different units of College; and 
c. To come up with an evidence-based policy making for the improvement of 

the next years implementation of projects. 
 

10.4. Additionally, a cash advance amounting to ₱150,000.00 was granted to an 
ASSCAT official under LDDAP-ADA No. 99-19-12-179 dated             
December 2, 2019 for the following expenses listed in the activity design: 
 

Description Quantity Cost Total 
Snacks 350 pax ₱150.00 ₱ 52,500.00 
Food for lunch 350 pax ₱250.00  87,500.00 
Decoration, supplies and materials    5,000.00 
Miscellaneous    5,000.00 

Total ₱ 150,000.00 
 

10.5. Records showed that the aforementioned cash advance was liquidated under 
Liquidation Report No. 20-01-028 dated January 17, 2020 with actual expenses 
incurred totaling ₱163,303.96 as summarized in the table below: 
 

Particulars Actual Expenses 
Foods ₱ 109,006.17 
Supplies  10,138.25 
Assorted groceries (Goods)  20,434.81 
Unidentifiable items  23,724.73 

Total ₱ 163,303.96 



66 
 

10.6. The foregoing expenses were only supported with a Certificate of Emergency 
Purchase, Reimbursement Expense Receipts, Official Receipts, and Tape 
Registers from various Department and Grocery Stores. However, the use of 
the Certificate of Emergency Purchase to support the liquidation of the above 
expenses could not be justified as the said activity was an annual event of the 
College and is therefore an activity that could have been foreseen. 
 

10.7. Interview with the Procurement Officer revealed that expenses for the said 
activity was not included in the APP of the College. She also admitted that some 
activities that were already planned and set for CYs 2019 and 2020 were also 
not included in their respective APPs and thus were purchased through cash 
advances. 
 

10.8. Accordingly, the goods needed for the said activity should have been procured 
through competitive bidding, or an alternative method of procurement if the 
circumstances allowed, pursuant to the provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its 
revised IRR. Nonetheless, since the purchases were made directly to the 
suppliers without undergoing the required procurement process, documents 
such as the Requests for Quotation, Abstract of Canvass, Purchase Requests, 
and Purchase Orders, which would have corroborated the validity and propriety 
of the disbursements, were not prepared. 
 

10.9. Further review of the said liquidation report revealed that the “assorted 
groceries” amounting to ₱20,434.81 was not in the budgetary requirements of 
the activity design of the Year-end Report and Assessment activity and the 
purpose for which the payment was made was not specified, thus were deemed 
unnecessary. 
 

10.10. Moreover, expenses totaling ₱23,724.73 were only supported with tape 
registers whose texts had already faded, thus preventing the Audit Team from 
ascertaining whether the expenses are related to the said activity. 
 

10.11. As a result of the above conditions, the College was not assured that quality 
goods were obtained at its most advantageous price and the regularity, validity 
and propriety of the disbursements could not be ascertained. Likewise, the 
expenses pertaining to “assorted groceries” totaling ₱20,434.81 were deemed 
unnecessary and are disallowable in audit. 
 

10.12. We recommended that Management observe the procurement process as 
required under the pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 
No. 9184 in the procurement of goods and services needed for activities that 
are already expected to be conducted. 
 

10.13. We also recommended that Management present any available supporting 
documents to substantiate the purchase of assorted groceries totaling 
₱20,434.81 for further review.

10.14. During the exit conference, Management acknowledged the foregoing 
deficiencies and committed to observe the procurement process in the 
procurement of goods and services needed for the activities of the College that 
are already expected and set. 
 

10.15. Management also committed to submit other alternative documents available to 
support the purchase of the said assorted groceries. 

 
 
Excess Claims for the Payments of Daily Travel Expenses 
 
11. Daily travel expense claims of 10 ASSCAT personnel totaling ₱29,430.00 for a side 

trip included in their itineraries of travel in the attendance of the “Retooling on 
Knowledge Generation and Technology Transfer and Environmental Scanning 
on Genderized Community Extension on Research-based Innovation in Visayas 
Universities” activity were paid despite the said side trip being a non-official 
business, hence, claims thereof are deemed excessive pursuant to Section 5.1 of 
COA Circular No. 2012-003. 
 
11.1. Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines 

excessive expenditure as “unreasonable expense or expense incurred at an 
immoderate quantity and exorbitant price. It also includes expenses which 
exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably 
high and beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses in excess 
of reasonable limits.” 
 

11.2. Furthermore, Section 5(c) of Executive Order (E.O.) No. 77 states that the 
allowable daily travel expenses for travel beyond the 50-kilometer radius from 
the permanent official station shall be based on the following apportionment: 
 

Particulars Percentage To Cover 
Day of arrival at point of destination 
(regardless of time) and succeeding 
day/s thereof on official business 

100% 
Hotel/lodging (50%), 
meals (30%), and 
incidental expenses (20%) 

Day of departure for permanent 
official station (regardless of time) if 
other than date of arrival 

50% Meals (30%), and incidental expenses (20%) 

 
11.3. Moreover, Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445 provides that, “claims against 

government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 
 

11.4. Review of the training design of the “Retooling on Knowledge Generation and 
Technology Transfer and Environmental Scanning on Genderized Community 
Extension on Research-based Innovation in Visayas Universities” activity 



68 
 

revealed that 22 personnel of ASSCAT were directed to attend the said activity 
on December 8–13, 2019. The training design, as well as the itineraries of travel 
of the participants, showed that the activity was to be conducted at specific dates 
in different universities as shown in the following table: 
 

Date Destination No. of Participants 
December 9, 2019 Cebu Technology University 22 
December 10, 2019 University of San Carlos, Cebu City 22 

December 11, 2019 
University of the Philippines Visayas, Iloilo 8 
Aklan State University, Aklan 14 

 
11.5. Moreover, the said destinations were also indicated in the travel orders dated 

November 28, 2019 of the participants. 
 

11.6. Audit however revealed that a “side trip” on December 12, 2019 was also 
included in the training design but was not indicated as such in the itineraries 
of travel of the participants, instead, it was left blank still with a budget of 
₱1,500.00 as a per diem for that day. No other information was provided 
regarding this specific trip to corroborate that it is related to the purpose of the 
official business. 
 

11.7. It is to be emphasized that any activity irrelevant to the purpose of the travel is 
not considered an official business, hence, the claims of 10 ASSCAT personnel 
for the payment of daily travel expenses totaling ₱29,430.00, as shown in detail 
in Annex I, for their “side trip” on December 12, 2019, are deemed excessive. 
 

11.8. Furthermore, four of the 22 personnel mentioned above had only liquidated 
their cash advances for the said activity nine to 12 months after their return from 
the trip while two personnel had yet to liquidate their cash advances for the 
same activity as of December 31, 2020, summarized as follows: 
 

LDDAP ADA No. 
DV No. Amount Date Liquidated Date No. 

12/02/19 99-19-12-0179 19-12-1223 ₱ 30,170.00 Unliquidated

12/02/19 99-19-12-0179 19-12-1236  30,170.00 09/07/20 

 
11.9. The foregoing deficiencies indicated weakness of internal controls on the grant 

and liquidation of cash advances, thus lead to the incurrence of excessive 
expenditures and casted doubt on the regularity, validity and propriety of the 
claims. 
 



69 
 

11.10. We recommended that Management shall: 

• Direct the concerned personnel to refund the daily travel expenses 
claims that were deemed excessive in audit totaling ₱29,430.00;and 

• Require the immediate liquidation of the cash advances granted under 
Disbursement Voucher Nos. 19-12-1223 and 19-12-1228. 

 
Management Comments 

 
11.11. Management acknowledge the foregoing deficiencies and committed to 

implement the audit recommendations. 
 

11.12. During the exit conference, Management also promised to refund the daily 
travel expenses claims that were deemed excessive in audit totaling ₱29,430.00. 

 
 
Immoderate Budget for Airline Tickets and Delayed Refund of Unutilized Cash Advances 
 
12. Of the ₱280,000.00 budget for the purchase of plane tickets provided under the 

two cash advances granted to defray the expenses of the 111th and 112th Board of 
Trustees special meetings at Davao City, only ₱60,561.00 or 22 percent was 
actually utilized as the said budget included unnecessary plane tickets for four 
participants who reside within Caraga at an immoderate budgeted cost of 
₱20,000.00 each, contrary to Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445, thus prevented the 
utilization of the excess amount of ₱219,439.00 for the other prioritized 
expenditures of the College as the said amount was rightfully remitted to the 
Bureau of the Treasury. Likewise, the total unutilized amount of the said cash 
advances totaling ₱226,831.37 was not refunded immediately upon liquidation, 
inconsistent with Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445, thereby exposing it to risks of loss 
and/or misuse. 

 
12.1. Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 states that it is the declared policy of the State that 

“All resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 
accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage 
through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 
economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility 
to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief 
or head of the government agency concerned.” 
 

12.2. Section 89 of the same P.D. provides, among others, that “A cash advance shall 
be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has 
been served.” 
 

12.3. Audit of disbursements revealed that cash advances totaling ₱476,500.00 were 
granted to an ASSCAT official to defray the expenses of the 111th and 112th 
BOT special meeting held on February 14 and 28, 2020, respectively, at Davao 
City. 



70 
 

12.4. Audit further revealed that ₱280,000.00 or almost 60 percent of the total cash 
advances were budgeted for the purchase of round-trip plane tickets as 
presented in their Activity Designs and illustrated below:

Total ₱ 241,000.00 ₱ 235,500.00 ₱ 476,500.00 
 

12.5. Review of the liquidations of the said cash advances disclosed that only 
₱60,561.00 or 22 percent were utilized for the purchase of round-trip plane 
tickets out of the budgeted amount of ₱280,000.00, leaving an amount of 
₱219,439.00 that was refunded to the Cashier and remitted to the Bureau of the 
Treasury, as shown below:

Total ₱ 280,000.00 ₱ 60,561.00 ₱ 219,439.00 
 

12.6. Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that the budget for the purchase of plane 
tickets was estimated by taking into consideration the availability of the 
participants, so the booking is usually done on the day or a day before the actual 
flight and random promo airline flights could not be taken advantage, hence 
their reason behind the estimated budget. 
 

12.7. Nevertheless, the estimated budget for the plane ticket at ₱20,000.00 each is 
unreasonably high even for a round-trip flight that is booked as close to the 
actual flight. Even the actual costs of the plane tickets purchased for the 112th 
BOT special meeting is significantly less than ₱10,000.00 for one-way flights 
and less than ₱20,000.00 for round-trip flights as shown below:

One-way  2,986.00 
One-way  4,278.00 

Total ₱ 54,871.00 
 

12.8. Furthermore, it was verified that four of the seven participants reside in Caraga 
and do not need air transportation to reach the venue of the meeting but were 
still considered in coming up with the budget for the purchase of plane tickets, 
thereby further inflating the budget. Additionally, the liquidation report shows 
that the costs of the plane tickets of two participants, who were not originally 
part of the seven participants budgeted for plane tickets, were also shouldered 
by ASSCAT. 
 

12.9. Moreover, it was noted that the unutilized portion of the said cash advances 
totaling ₱226,831.37 were not refunded as soon as the Liquidation Reports for 
the actual expenses were submitted as evidenced by Official Receipts 
enumerated below:

Total ₱ 249,668.63 Total ₱ 226,831.37 
 

12.10. It should be emphasized that any unutilized amount of a cash advance should 
be refunded immediately and ideally should have been made on or before the 
submission of the liquidation report given that these are hard cash that should 
still be and readily in the possession of the grantee of the cash advance. 
 

12.11. The foregoing deficiencies manifested the College’s inefficiency in the 
preparation of the budget for the BOT special meetings as well as in the grant 
and liquidation of cash advances as this prevented the college from utilizing the 
excess amount of ₱219,439.00 for other prioritized expenditures since the said 
amount was rightfully remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury. Likewise, the 
total unutilized amount of the said cash advances totaling ₱226,831.37 was also 
exposed to risks of loss and/or misuse as this was not refunded immediately 
upon liquidation. 
 
 
 
 



72 
 

12.12. We recommended that Management shall direct the concerned personnel 
to prudently prepare the budget of the activity design for BOT special 
meetings to come up with a reasonable amount of cash advance. 
 

12.13. Henceforth, ensure that the unutilized portion of the cash advances are 
refunded to the Cashier as soon as the purpose for the said cash advance is 
fulfilled. 

 
Management Comments 
 
12.14. Management committed to prudently prepare the budget of the activity for the 

BOT Special Meetings to come up with a reasonable amount of cash advance 
and to ensure that the unutilized portion of cash advances are refunded to the 
Cashier as soon as the purpose for the said cash advance is fulfilled. 

 
 
Inadequate Supporting Documents for the Use of Stipends for the Payment of Outstanding 
Balances of the Student-Grantees 
 
13. Stipends intended for the student-grantees were not released in full as a portion 

thereof totaling ₱148,358.40 was utilized to pay the outstanding balances of the 
said students through a cash advance that was not supported with a 
documentation indicating that there was consent to such arrangement, 
inconsistent with Section 4.1.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 4(6) of 
P.D. No. 1445, thus casting doubt on the regularity and propriety of the 
disbursement. 

 
13.1. Section 4.1.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 states that, “The cash advance shall 

be used solely for the specific legal purpose for which it was granted. Under no 
circumstance shall it be used for encashment of checks of for liquidation of a 
previous cash advance.” 
 

13.2. Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445 states that “Claims against government funds 
shall be supported with complete documentation.” 
 

13.3. Records show that the cash advance granted to the Accountable Officer under 
check no. 2050665 on November 19, 2019 amounting to ₱148,358.40 was for 
the release of stipends to the students selected under the TES Program. 
 

13.4. Scrutiny of the report of cash disbursements for the above cash advance 
disclosed that the entire amount was not released to the students as stipends, 
instead, it was used to the pay their outstanding balances as indicated in the 
attached Official Receipt No. 56847 dated November 26, 2019. Likewise, the 
report did not include any document that would show that the students 
consented to such arrangement. Additionally, not all of the students affixed their 
signature in the payrolls. 



73 
 

13.5. Interview with a personnel in the Accounting Office revealed that although the 
disbursement voucher for the subject cash advance states that it was for the 
payment of the stipends of the students selected under the TES program, the 
amount was only a portion of the sum of the stipends that were to be released 
to the students and was really intended to be used as payment for the 
outstanding balance of the said students by segregating the amount in a different 
payroll. Moreover, she admitted that they could not obtain the signatures of all 
the students because some of them live in remote areas. 
 

13.6. Evidently, the above condition was inconsistent with the aforementioned 
provisions, thus casted doubt on the regularity and propriety of the 
disbursement. 
 

13.7. We recommended that Management submit to the Office of the Auditor a 
document showing that there was consent from the student-grantees to use 
a portion of their stipends to pay their corresponding outstanding 
balances. 
 

Management Comments 
 

13.8. During the exit conference, Management mentioned that they had already 
prepared a document indicating that there was consent in the use of the stipends 
as payment to the outstanding balances of the student-grantees and committed 
to submit the same to the Office of the Auditor once the signatures of the 
concerned student-grantees are affixed in the said document. 
 

 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
14. For CY 2020, the College had total appropriations of ₱136,917,000.00 as indicated in 

its FY 2020 GAA. Of the total appropriations, ₱24,274,586.24 or 17.73 percent was 
allotted for GAD programs, projects, and activities to address identified gender issues, 
as incorporated in their GAD Plan and Budget (PB) for CY 2020 approved by the 
Philippine Commission on Women (PCW). Moreover, the GAD Accomplishment 
Report (AR) of the College, which was still under the review by the CHED Regional 
Office No. XIII when the GAD AR was submitted to the Office of the Auditor, showed 
that only ₱12,843,896.84 or 52.91 percent of the total amount allotted was utilized.

14.2. As shown in the foregoing table, the College was only able to conduct 13 of the 
27 planned GAD Client and Organization Focused Activities resulting in actual 
expenditures of only ₱2,788,165.80 or 27.68 percent of the budgeted amount. 
Additionally, actual expenditures for programs attributed to GAD aggregated 
₱10,055,731.04. Consequently, a total of ₱12,843,896.84 was actually 
expended or 52.91 percent of the approved budget were utilized and attributed 
as GAD related expenses. 

 
14.3. Management commented that most of the activities were cancelled due to the 

restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the College could 
not fully utilize the budget since most activities/sessions were conducted on an 
in-house or online setup, thereby translating to less expenditures. 

 
14.4. The GAD related activities conducted by the College that addressed the various 

gender issues are shown in Annexes J and K. 
 
14.5. It is also worth mentioning that the College had created the GAD Focal Point 

System under the Magna Carta of Women since 2014 and was reconstituted 
regularly.

B. Value for Money Audit 
 
Ineffective and Inefficient Distribution of Financial Assistance to the Student Grantees 

 
15. The practice of the College in the distribution of financial assistance to the 

intended student beneficiaries aggregating ₱49,276,500.00 in the form of cash 
through the cash advances of the Disbursing Officer instead of electronic fund 
transfer was determined to be ineffective and inefficient in view of the risks and 
dangers that the practice entailed and the benefits provided by the available 
electronic fund transfer systems, contrary to Item No. 18 under Section 8.3.1(d) 
of the CHED-DBM-DSWD and DOLE Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01, thus 
resulted in wasted man-hours, delayed the liquidation of cash advances, and 
exposed government funds to the risk of loss and/or theft. 
 
15.1. Section 7.0 of the Memorandum Circular No. 2018-0001 issued by UniFAST 

Governing Board, which provides the guidelines for the Expanded Students’ 
Grants-In-Aid Program for Poverty Alleviation (ESGP-PA) covered under the 
Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Law (R.A. No. 10931) through 
Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) during its transitory period, states that 
“Subject to the finalization of the TES guidelines, the specific program 
management to be applied shall be consistent with Section 8.3 of CHED-DBM-
DSWD and DOLE Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01 dated June 23, 2016.” 
 

15.2. Moreover, Item No. 18 under Section 8.3.1(d) of the CHED-DBM-DSWD and 
DOLE Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01 dated June 23, 2016 provides that 
“it is the responsibility of the SUCs to encourage each student-grantee to open 
an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Savings Account with the Land Bank of 
the Philippines of Development Bank of the Philippines.” 
 

15.3. Audit disclosed that in CY 2020, the Disbursing Officer was granted cash 
advances totaling ₱49,276,500.00 for the purpose of distributing the financial 
assistance provided by the various Student Financial Assistance Programs to 
the intended student beneficiaries, as listed in the table below:

Total ₱ 49,276,500.00 

 
15.4. During the conduct of cash examination last December 1, 2020, cash advances 

aggregating ₱31,200,000.00 granted under check nos. 2050957, 2050958, 
2050976 and 2050977 remained unliquidated. As part of the cash examination 
procedures and in order to establish the accountability of the Disbursing 
Officer, the Audit Team counted several paper currencies that were enclosed in 
1,560 envelopes at a uniform amount of ₱20,000.00. It was determined that the 
said amount was for the purpose of distributing the financial assistance provided 
by the various Student Financial Assistance Programs to the intended student 
beneficiaries. 
 

15.5. The process of segregating several one thousand pesos and five hundred pesos 
paper bills in an amount of ₱20,000.00 in an envelope for each of the 
beneficiaries was already a big burden on the part of the Disbursing Officer. In 
addition to that, waiting for the beneficiaries to claim the financial assistance 
not only added to the monitoring workload of the Disbursing Officer but also 
delayed the liquidation of the cash advances. 
 

15.6. Furthermore, withdrawing and taking custody of government funds already 
exposes one to several risk and danger, let alone the encashment of checks 
worth millions of pesos. Moreover, if word gets out that the Disbursing Officer 
is taking custody of piles of cash, she could find herself a target for thieves, 
thereby endangering her life as well. 
 

15.7. The foregoing risks and danger could evidently be prevented by requiring each 
beneficiary to open an ATM Savings Account as this would allow the College 
to electronically transfer their claims into each of the account of the 
beneficiaries with ease, thereby saving the Disbursing Officer from all of the 
inconvenience mentioned above.  
 

15.8. Consequently, the foregoing practice signified the ineffectiveness and 
inefficiency of the College in the release of various financial assistance to the 
intended student beneficiaries, thus resulted in wasted man-hours, delayed the 
liquidation of cash advances, and exposed government funds to the risk of loss 
and/or theft.

15.9. We recommended that Management require each student receiving 
benefits or allowances from the various Student Financial Assistance 
Programs to open an ATM Savings Account, as encouraged under Item 
No. 18 under Section 8.3.1(d) of the CHED-DBM-DSWD and DOLE Joint 
Memorandum Circular No. 01 dated June 23, 2016, to lessen the burden 
on the Disbursing Officer and eliminate the identified risks and danger. 

 
Management Comments 

 
15.10. Management commented that ASSCAT had required the student-grantees to 

open an ATM Savings Account before but because most of the said students 
withdrew the entire financial assistance credited to their accounts, the required 
balance therein could not be maintained. 
 

15.11. Furthermore, they opted to release the financial assistance through the cash 
advances of the Disbursing Officer as it was the fastest way to immediately 
distribute the financial assistance to the student-grantees especially during those 
trying times of the global pandemic. 
 

15.12. Nevertheless, Management committed to implement the recommendation 
through the new student subsidy program of CHED-UniFAST and 
LANDBANK wherein LANDBANK Cash Cards will be issued to the student-
grantees for their monthly stipends to cover expenses for supplies, 
transportation, room and board, and other personal and school needs. 

 
 
Search Committee for Presidency (SCP) Meeting Conducted Out of Town 
 
16. Had the 2nd ASSCAT SCP meeting been conducted in a much accessible venue 

within the Caraga Region, in view of Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445, expenses for the 
said activity would have been more economical and participants would have been 
prevented from incurring unnecessary and extravagant expenditures totaling 
₱100,757.11. 

 
16.1. Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that “It is the declared policy of the State 

that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 
accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage 
through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 
economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility 
to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief 
or head of the government agency concerned.” 
 

16.2. Moreover, Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 
defines unnecessary expenditures as “expenditures which could not pass the 
test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting 
non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. This would also include 



78 
 

incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and 
those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time. An 
expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without 
loss of damage to property is considered as unnecessary.” 
 

16.3. Likewise, Section 6.1 of the same circular defines extravagant expenditures as 
“those incurred without restraint, judiciousness and economy. Extravagant 
expenditures exceed the bounds of propriety. These expenditures are 
immoderate, prodigal, lavish, grossly excessive and injudicious.” 
 

16.4. Audit revealed that payment for the expenses incurred during the 2nd ASSCAT 
SCP meeting held at Bellavista Hotel, Lapu- Lapu City, Province of Cebu on 
December 20, 2019, totaled ₱130,680.11, covered by the following documents:

12/09/2019 99-19-12-183 Francis Tom A. Paredes  10,400.00 19-12-1410  13,845.00 
12/13/2019 103620 Joan M. Pislan  10,400.00 19-12-1424  16,281.40 

Total ₱ 110,800.00 Total ₱ 130,680.11 

 
16.5. Examination further revealed that the actual expenses incurred above included 

hotel accommodation, venue rental, plane fare, rebooking fee, baggage fee, van 
rental, and tour, as shown with their corresponding amounts below: 
 

Expenses Amount 
Hotel accommodation ₱ 19,384.00 
Venue   5,000.00 
Plane fare   64,735.40 
Rebooking   3,285.00 
Baggage   4,667.00 
Van Rental   3,000.00 
Tour   685.71 

Total ₱ 100,757.11 
 

16.6. Additionally, as cited in the narrative report attached as supporting document 
to the payment of the above expenses, the objectives of the SCP meeting were 
the following: 

a. To convene the male and female members of the SCP; 
b. To set schedule of meetings of the SCP; and 
c. To set the rules and regulations for the search. 

 
16.7. Further, as reflected in the attendance sheet, the meeting was attended by the 

Chairperson, four SCP members, two secretariat and one ASSCAT Staff. It is 
worth mentioning that of the eight participants, only one came from Visayas, 
while the rest were from Mindanao. 



79 
 

16.8. The foregoing conditions lead the Audit Team to question why the meeting was 
held in an area remote to the residences of majority of the participants as this 
would only mean greater expenses especially for transportation and hotel 
accommodation. As a result, an inquiry was made through an Audit Query dated 
October 27, 2020 to find out mainly the necessity of conducting the meeting in 
Lapu-Lapu City when such could have been held in a much accessible venue 
for the majority which in turn would greatly reduce the expenses of the activity. 
 

16.9. In their reply to the said Audit Query, it can be inferred that Management 
approved the Activity Design, and thus the venue was set in Lapu-Lapu City, 
based solely on the fact that it was decided by the ASSCAT SCP Members. The 
reply did not contain any information regarding why it was necessary and more 
advantageous to the SCP to conduct the meeting in Lapu-Lapu City rather than 
in any area close to majority of the participants, thus, they were not able to 
justify that the aforementioned expenses totaling ₱100,757.11 were not 
unnecessary and extravagant in view of economy and efficiency. 
 

16.10. Consequently, the above circumstances resulted in the incurrence of 
unnecessary and extravagant expenses totaling ₱100,757.11 which are 
disallowable in audit. 
 

16.11. We recommended that Management exercise prudence in spending 
government funds to ensure that government resources are utilized wisely 
and to avoid the incurrence of unnecessary and extravagant expenditures. 

 
Management Comments 

 
16.12. Management admitted in their reply that the venue for the 2nd SCP meeting was 

indeed far from the official stations of most members but they argued that the 
same was justifiably set in Cebu in consideration of the prior commitments of 
all members. 
 

16.13. Nevertheless, Management assured during the exit conference that prudence 
and extraordinary diligence will be observed in the utilization of government 
resources by the College.

UNIMPLEMENTED AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 Shown below is the status of implementation of the 39 audit recommendations 
embodied in CY 2019 and prior years’ Annual Audit Reports, of which 16 were fully 
implemented, 20 were partially implemented, and three were not implemented. 
 

Audit Observations and 
Recommendations Ref. Management Action 

Auditor’s 
Validation 

1. The existence and accuracy of the 
Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment 
account balance amounting 
₱19,495,084.85 could not be relied 
upon due to:  a) inclusion of various 
PPE items with cost above the 
capitalization threshold of 
₱15,000.00 aggregating  
₱17,142,552.85 and  b) non-
submission of the Report of Supplies 
and Materials Issued, resulting in 
unrecorded issuances of supplies 
and materials in the books totaling 
₱2,050,422.00, thereby, overstating 
the Semi-Expandable ICT 
Equipment account while 
understating the related PPE, 
Depreciation Expense, as well as 
Semi-Expandable ICT Equipment 
Expense accounts and ultimately 
affecting the fair presentation of the 
said accounts in the financial 
statement. 

 
We recommended that Management:

The Supply Officer 
submitted the RSMI to 
the Accounting Office. 
Consequently, the 
necessary journal entry 
was prepared by the 
Accountant. 

Due to the restrictions 
brought about by the 
pandemic in CY 
2020, the second audit 
recommendation was 
not implemented. 

a. Instruct the Supply Officer to 
coordinate with the College’s 
Disposal Committee to 
immediately conduct the disposal 
of unserviceable PPE in 
accordance with the Manual on the 
Disposal of Government Property 
to avoid further deterioration and 
in order to realize income from the 
sale of said properties;

c. Direct the Accountant to make 
necessary adjustments in the 
books of accounts to reclassify the 
PPE items booked under Semi-
Expendable ICT Equipment 
account to appropriate PPE 
accounts and provide for 
depreciation expenses on these 
assets and recognize the issuance 
of ICT equipment upon 
submission of RSMI, with the 
proposed adjusting journal entries. 
 

  Fully Implemented 

2. The grant and liquidation of cash 
advances totaling ₱2,092,800.00 for 
the conduct of various activities of 
the College were not supported with 
complete documentation due to 
inadequate internal controls on the 
same, not in accordance with 
Sections 4(6) and 124 of P.D. No. 
1445, thus casting doubt on the 
validity and propriety of the said 
transactions. 

 
We recommended that Management: 

AAR

Management instructed 
its personnel to ensure 
that the grant of cash 
advance and its 
liquidation are 
adequately supported. 
Furthermore, the 
documents requested in 
the second audit 
recommendation were 
submitted to the Office 
of the Auditor on      
May 15, 2020. 

 

a. Instruct the concerned personnel 
to ensure that the grant of cash 
advance and liquidation thereof 
are supported with complete and 
appropriate documents to 
substantiate the validity and 
correctness of the claims and to 
avoid the suspension of 
transactions; and 
 

 Fully Implemented 

b. Immediately submit to the Office 
of the Auditor the relevant 
Activity/Training Designs, and 
Itineraries of Travel, Office Order, 
Travel Authorities or their 
equivalent to support the grant of 
the above-mentioned cash 
advances totaling ₱2,092,800.00, 
and the Attendance Sheets or 
Certificates of Appearance to 
substantiate the liquidation of the 
same.

Office of the Auditor with an 
aggregate contract amount of 
₱159,175,099.45 involving the 
procurement of nine infrastructure 
projects and 13 contracts for the 
delivery of goods and services were

Documents such as 
the related Minutes of 
the BAC Meeting,

were placed/stored in unsafe 
locations pending the completion of 
the Crops and Soil Laboratory

2017-2019, who were not from duly 
recognized private organizations or 
groups in a sector or discipline

or not from any non-government 
organization, which was not in 
accordance with Sections 13.1 and 
13.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 
No. 9184, thus, transparency, 
accountability, and public 
monitoring of the procurement 
process were compromised.

6. Payment for monthly salaries of 
ASSCAT employees from January 
to September 2019 totaling 
₱19,135,093.58 were not supported 
by DTRs of the payees and other 
relevant supporting documents, 
inconsistent with Section 4(6) of P.D. 
No. 1445 and Section 1.2.1 of COA 
Circular No. 2012-001, thus casting 
doubt on the validity and propriety 
of the claims. Likewise, the entire 
amount of the monthly salaries was 
credited to the savings account of the 
payees as early as four days from the 
beginning of the month, which is a 
departure from Section 3.2.9, 
Chapter 3 of the Manual on Position 
Classification and Compensation. 

 
We recommended that Management: 

AAR 
2019, 
page

A new personnel was 
assigned in the HRMO 
to assist in the encoding 
of data. However, the 
entire salary for the 
month is credited to the 
accounts of the 
employees on or near 
the 15th day of the 
month. 

In a discussion with 
Management last 
February 22, 2021, it 
was disclosed that full 
compliance on the 
second audit 
recommendation will 
be possible once the 
Land Bank of the 
Philippines will 
branch out in 
Bunawan, Agusan del 
Sur. 

a. Assign new staff personnel to the 
HRMO to perform the encoding of data 
contained in the DTRs into their 
worksheet to facilitate the timely 
submission of DTRs and other 
supporting documents for CY 2019 to 
the Office of the Auditor to allow the 
Audit Team to evaluate the validity and 
propriety of the payment of the 
monthly salaries; and

amount of the employees’ monthly 
salaries to their savings account early 
in the month where services have not 
yet been fully rendered.

requirements in Sections 22 and 23 
of the Omnibus Rules Implementing 
Book V of the Administrative Code

Fund, inconsistent with Section 4(d) 
of R.A. No. 8929, Section 1 of the 
Special Provisions applicable to the 
SUCs under the GAA of FYs 2018–
2019, Section 5.1 of DBM Budget 
Circular No. 2003-6, and the 
Supreme Court Decision on the case 
docketed under G.R. No. 211999,

Per diems/ Honoraria of 
the BOT of ASSCAT 
are now funded out of 
the Regular Agency 
Fund of the College.

Nos. 2020-001-05

to Management. 

a. Stop the practice of charging the 
payment of per diems of the BOT 
of ASSCAT during board 
meetings to the IGF fund and 
ensure that payment related 
thereto shall be charged against the 
amount appropriated in the GAA 
and any deficiency shall be

11. The adequacy of internal controls 
over disbursements led to the 
payment of expenses for catering 
services totaling ₱223,300.00 during 
meetings, trainings, seminars, and 
conferences of the College despite 
lack of complete and proper 
documentation, contrary to Section 
2 of P.D. No. 1445, thus validity and 
propriety of the disbursements 
could not be ascertained. Moreover, 
these expenses were paid through 
the cash advances made by ASSCAT 
officials instead of paying directly to 
the suppliers through checks issued 
by the College, contrary to COA 
Circular No. 97-002, thereby 
depriving the government of 
additional income from the 
withholding of taxes.

12. Had the College immediately 
enforced settlement and exerted 
effort to collect the disallowed 
amount of ₱1,541,189.23 from the 66 
persons liable under the various 
Notices of Disallowance, the said 
amount would not have remained 
outstanding for three months to six 
years from the date of issuance of 
the COE, contrary to Section 7.1, 
Chapter II of the 2009 RRSA, thus, 
delay in complying or refusal to 
comply of the persons liable with the

constitutes a ground for contempt,

action against them.

ASSCAT employees of their liability

deduction were not enough to meet 
the monthly payments required in 
the installment schedule approved 
by COA Prosecution and Litigation 
Office due to the take-home pay 
limit requirement, contrary to Item 
No. 2 of COA Resolution No. 2017-

the liabilities and depriving the 
College of the benefits from the use 
of resources to be refunded.

We recommended that Management

The submitted GAD

We recommend that Management 
maximize the utilization of the GAD

funds were provided.  Likewise, direct 
the GAD focal persons to identify and

leaving an unutilized fund balance 
of ₱6,220,323.87, due to lapses in the 
procurement process and poor

establish a more realistic ABC to 
avoid, if not minimize the 
occurrence of failed bidding that 
could greatly affect the attainment 
of College’s accomplishments;

properties aggregating ₱12.585 
million were allowed to further 
deteriorate and were not dropped 
from the books of accounts, 
contrary to Section 79 of 
Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 
and Section 40 of the GAM, Volume 
I, thus depriving the College of the 
opportunity to earn additional 
income had the said properties been 
sold through public auction or 
negotiated sale, as the case maybe, 
resulting in unrecorded impairment 
loss and overstatement of the 
affected PPE and related 
Accumulated Depreciation 
accounts. 

 
We recommended that Management:

The Supply Officer had 
already submitted the 
IIRUP to the 
Accounting Office and 
requested the 
inspection of said

following year as the 
actual disposal 
occurred in CY 2021. 
Moreover, the 
Accounting Office 
has yet to establish the 
accumulated 
depreciation balance 
of the unserviceable

a. Instruct the Supply Officer to 
coordinate with the College’s Disposal 
Committee to immediately conduct the

accordance with the Manual on the 
Disposal of Government Property to 
avoid further deterioration and in order 
to realize income from the sale of said
