OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Unaccounted Receivable Accounts 

 

1. Receivable accounts amounting to ₱16,363,810.26 with no documents to support 
its validity and dormant for 19 years remained not written-off due to non-

submission by management of the required supporting documents thereof thus, 

affecting the fair presentation of the receivable accounts in the Financial 

Statements.  

 

Instructions A to C of Appendix 6 of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for NGAs provides that “the SLs shows detail for each control accounts in the 

General Ledger (GL) which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the 

Accounting Division/Unit.” 

 

An accounts receivable SL is an accounting ledger that shows the transaction 

and payment history of each customer to whom the business extends credit. The 

balance in each customer account is periodically reconciled with the accounts 

receivable balance in the GL to ensure its accuracy.  

 

Verification of the current year accounting records showed that as of 

December 31, 2020, total receivables amounted to ₱72,550,031.13, of which 

₱16,363,810.26 or 22.56 percent were dormant for 19 years and remained  

unaccounted due to absence of SLs and supporting documents. Details are shown 

below:

Total 37,615,614.18                   16,363,810.26  

 

The CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR) included the same findings wherein 

the Management disclosed that the unaccounted balances referred to the transferred 

amounts from the merger of the three abolished Commissions and Councils, namely 

Presidential Commission to Fight Poverty, the Social Reform Council and the 

Presidential Council for Countryside Development, wherein NAPC is the successor-

in-interest.  Management could no longer account for the said balances due to lack of 

available data/supporting documents or SLs of the transferred accounts.

The Management had submitted on October 10, 2018, thru the Office of the 

Auditor, a request for authority to write off the said unaccounted/unreconciled 

accounts.  The said request was endorsed by the Audit Team to the Office of the 

Assistant Commissioner thru the Office of the Cluster Director (OCD), National 

Government Sector (NGS) Cluster 1.  However, it was returned to the Agency on 

December 11, 2018, due to lack of supporting documents, such as the proof of 

exhaustion of remedies to account for the said unaccounted/undocumented balances. 

 

The unaccounted amount of ₱16,363,810.26, same with previous AAR 

findings, still floated in the analysis of receivable accounts. The Management was not 

able to take action with the prior year’s recommendation for the year 2020 hence, 

documents required by the OCD to support said request were still not submitted.  

 

The inclusion of unaccounted balance of ₱16,363,810.26 affected the fair 

presentation of the Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/POs accounts in the 

Financial Statements. 

 

We reiterated the recommendation and Management agreed to submit the 

proof of exhaustion of remedies as required by the OCD, so that the request for 

authority to write off may be given due course. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 

 

Partial attainment of targets set in the MOA 

 

2. Five of the targeted seven priority Local Government Units (LGUs) were 
provided funds for initial tranche of ₱7,500,000.00 out of the actual target of 

₱10,500,000.00  to implement the 3S Prototype Project geared in developing 

locally based community enterprises as the two remaining LGUs failed to comply 

with the requirements set by NAPC under its Memorandum Order (MO) No. 

2019-10-087 relative to the Memorandum of Agreement with Philippine 

Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR). 

 

Section 3 of the MOA provides that “the financial assistance of PAGCOR to 

NAPC shall be utilized for the Local Convergence Initiatives in localizing the 

Sambayanihan Serbisyong Sambayanan (3S) Prototype project in seven target/priority 

areas/LGUs.” 

 

Poverty Reduction through Rural Development (PRRD): 3S Prototype Project 

is a convergence initiative of NAPC in partnership with PAGCOR and the recipient 

LGUs and the community beneficiaries that were geared in developing locally based 

community enterprises.   

 

Each prototype project has a fund allocation of ₱3,000,000.00 divided into two 

tranches (50 percent per tranche). Such fund was allocated into three components: a) 



29 

 

monetary allocation for construction of trading post/bagsakan center; b) allocation for 

the procurement of vehicle; and c) fund allocation for capitalization.  

An Oversight Committee with composition indicated under NAPC Special 

Order No. 2020-08-159 dated August 24, 2020 was created to monitor the utilization 

and implementation of project. 

 

Review and verification on the submitted progress report of the agency relative 

to the PRRD: 3S Prototype Project disclosed that out of the seven targeted priority 

areas, only five LGUs had complied with the requirements set by NAPC under its 

Memorandum Order (MO) No. 2019-10-087; hence, had successfully entered into a 

MOA with NAPC and received financial assistance from the PAGCOR fund.

The requirements per MO No. 2019-10-087 are as follows: 

 

Primary Documentary Requirements 

 

a. Certificate of Availability of Funds issued by the Chief Accountant; 
b. Existence of lawful and sufficient allotment duly obligated as certified by 

authorized officials; 

c. Approval of expenditure by the Secretary of NAPC; 
d. Certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred by 

NAPC to the LGU, if any, has been liquidated and accounted for in the 

books; and 

e. Sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of claim. 
  

Secondary Documentary Requirements to transfer funds to LGU 

 

a. Copy of Memorandum of Agreement between NAPC and the LGU;  
b. Resolution of the Sangguniang Bayan for the Local Chief Executive to 

enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with NAPC; 

c. Resolution of the Sangguniang Bayan adopting NAPC’s 
SAMBAYANIHAN framework under the core program ADAPT 40-1010 

as its anti-poverty program; 

d. Resolution of the Sangguniang Bayan adopting Coop’poration as the 
enterprise model to be used in the implementation of PRRD 

Sanbarangayan; 

e. Certification issued by the Local Chief Executive that the Local Poverty 
Reduction Action team (LPRAT) is duly constituted and functional; 

f. Designation order of the LGU Staff a s LGU Focal Person; 
g. Certification by the Local Chief Executive that a lot with a minimum land 

area of 150 square meters for the construction of the Agricultural Center 

and Trading Post had been identified; and 

h. Copy of the usufruct agreement entered and executed by and between the 
NAPC and the LGU over the use of lot, as the case may be. 

 

The targets per Work and Financial Plan (WFP) attached to the PAGCOR-

NAPC MOA had clearly indicated that by the end of the first quarter of CY 2020, 

NAPC should already have executed a MOA of all the seven priority areas with the 

concerned LGUs for the implementation of the prototype projects assigned per area. 

However, as of the preparation of this report, only five of the targets were attained by 

the agency.  

 

For Cebu City, it was indicated in the project’s progress report that a MOA was 

perfected on October 3, 2019, however, upon closer examination, the requirements 

under the NAPC MO were still for completion.  Meanwhile, the MOA signing with 



31 

 

Calbayog, Samar, scheduled on September 3, 2020, did not materialize due to 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Based on the foregoing, management appears to be not compliant with Section 3 

of the PAGCOR-NAPC MOA, as only five out of the identified seven priority 

areas/LGUs have a MOA for the implementation of the project. 

 

It should be noted that the grant from PAGCOR must be fully utilized within 

two years (July 22, 2019 to July 22, 2021) from signing of the same. 

 

Interview with management, as well as from the progress report submitted by 

management confirmed that the non-attainment of the targeted seven priority areas for 

the prototype projects was due to the risk imposed by COVID-19 pandemic, and due 

to various restrictions executed by various government instrumentalities on travel, 

mass gatherings and social distancing; hence, hindered NAPC’s operations and 

transactions. Nonetheless, the Office of the Secretary claimed that they had explored 

all avenues to fast track the turnover of the funds to the recipient LGUs within the 

bounds imposed of the new normal. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Communicate with the two remaining identified priority areas, and follow 
up the immediate completion and submission of LGU Cebu City of the 

requirements under NAPC MOA No. 2019-10-087, while for Calbayog, 

Samar, set a new date for the signing of MOA;  

 

b. Amend the timelines set in the WFP to reflect the new timelines for the 
remaining activities of the project; and  

 

c. Fast track the operation and implementation of the project to meet the 
target outcomes and outputs set in the PAGCOR-NAPC MOA. 

  

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances  

3. Deficiencies were noted in the granting and liquidation of Cash advances (CAs) 
granted to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) as (a) ₱1,756,565.11 remained 

unliquidated and had been outstanding for 91 to 821 days; and (b) ₱664,700.00 

were granted to several SDOs, without liquidating first their prior cash advances, 

likewise, contrary with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997 and Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445.  

 

Section 89 of PD No. 1445 states that “a CA shall be reported and liquidated as 

soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.”  

 



32 

 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 prescribes rules and 

regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs, to wit:  

 

4.1.2  No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee 

unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper 

accounting thereof is made.   

 

5.8  All cash advances shall all be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except 

for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the 

Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt. 

 

5.9  When no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received on or before 

January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the Accountable 

Officer’s (AO’s) salary. 

 

Verification of records showed that CAs granted to various SDOs totaling 

₱1,756,565.11, aged 34 to 821 days, remained unliquidated at year-end.  Aging of the 

CAs are shown on the table below:

been used for a period of more than two months thus no longer needed and must be 

returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer as prescribed on the 

aforementioned regulation. 

 

Further, analysis of the CAs granted to SDOs revealed that CAs amounting to 

₱664,700.00 were granted to SDOs, in addition to their existing accountability or 

without liquidating first their prior CAs, in violation of Item 4.1.2 of COA Circular

The Accountant was not able to send demand letters to the AOs/ SDOs with 

unliquidated CAs due to her assumption as the new accountant of the agency. 

Accordingly, delayed submission of liquidations and refunds of CAs were due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic and the new working arrangements of agency personnel. 

 

Nevertheless, the Accountant should strictly monitor liquidations of CAs and 

SDOs to observe the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation 

of CAs as provided under COA Circular No. 97-002 in order to avoid possible misuse 

of funds. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a)       SDOs to liquidate immediately their CAs that were outstanding for more 
than two months or no longer needed and those granted after which their 

purpose of granting had been served, otherwise, direct the Accountant to 



34 

 

cause the withholding of the salary of the concerned SDOs and refund 

immediately the unused balance upon submission of the liquidation reports; 

 

b)       Chief Accountant to: 
 

 Avoid granting CAs to SDO with outstanding CAs or unsettled  
accountability; and  

 

 Send demand letter to the AOs/ SDOs with unliquidated CAs or 
outstanding balances and if no action was undertaken by the latter, 

enforce the withholding of their salaries in accordance with Item 5.9 

of COA Circular No. 97-002.  

 

 

Non-disposal of unserviceable PPE 

 

4. Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of ₱4,198,979.01 remained 

undisposed contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and National Budget Circular 

(NBC) No. 425, resulting in further deterioration of the assets and depriving the 

Agency of any benefit or income that may be derived from its disposal.  

Moreover, these items were not yet dropped from the books due to the failure of 

the Supply Officer to submit the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to the Accounting Unit for its derecognition, as 

provided under Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that “when government property has 

become unserviceable for any cause  or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application 

of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly 

authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be 

valueless or unsaleable, it may be destroyed in their presence xxx” 

 

Further, the Manual on Disposal of Government Property embodied under NBC 

No. 425 dated January 28, 1992 was issued to guide agencies in their disposal 

undertakings.  Part I (A) thereof provides, among others, that disposal occurs when a 

piece of equipment or property can no longer provide efficient service or, though still 

working, has been rendered useless due to obsolescence. Disposal proceedings should 

be immediately initiated to avoid further deterioration of the property.  A systematic 

and timely disposal will yield benefits in terms of a higher appraised value/selling 

price and enabling storage areas available for other purposes. 

 

Comparison of the submitted Report on the Physical Count of Property Plant 

and Equipment (RPCPPE) with the balances in the books of accounts as at December 

31, 2020 showed no discrepancy, however, it was noted that of the total acquisition 



35 

 

cost of the Agency’s PPE of ₱35,662,314.93, ₱4,198,979.01 were unserviceable per 

IIRUP.  Details are shown on the table below.

Total 35,662,314.93 35,662,314.93 4,198,979.01 

  

Among the recommendations in CY 2019 was for management to facilitate the 

immediate disposal of various unserviceable PPE and to instruct the Supply/Property 

Officer to submit to the Chief Accountant the IIRUP for the recognition of the 

Impairment Loss-PPE in the books. 

 

Verifications showed documents prepared and completed by the 

Supply/Property Officer and the necessary procedures had been undertaken by 

Management but no disposal was conducted in CY 2020.  The unserviceable assets 

remained undisposed as at year-end, thereby, exposing the same to further 

deterioration and damage. It deprived the agency of the space occupied by these 

properties and the proceeds that maybe derived from the sale thereof, if any.  

  

Further, the reported unserviceable PPEs had increased to ₱4,198,979.01 from 

CY 2019 total amount of ₱3,336,357.40 recommended for disposal, thus, non-disposal 

of the same resulted to accumulation of unserviceable assets stored for disposal.  

 

It was also noted that the IIRUP was not submitted yet to the Accounting Unit 

for the derecognition in the books of accounts as provided for under Section 40(d), 

Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs  which states that all unserviceable 

property shall be reported in the IIRUP for dropping from the books by debiting 

Impairment Loss-PPE. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply/Property 

Officer to: 

 

a) Facilitate the immediate disposal of the unserviceable PPE in accordance 
with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and NBC No. 425 to avoid accumulation of 

unserviceable PPEs stored in the premises of NAPC; and 

 



36 

 

b) Submit to the Chief Accountant the IIRUP for the recognition of the 
Impairment Loss-PPE in accordance with Section 40(d), Chapter 10, 

Volume I  of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

 

Outstanding Accounts Payable for more than two years not reverted 
  

5. Out of the Accounts Payable balance as at December 31, 2020 amounting to 
₱29,779,125.78, ₱6,983,555.91 remained outstanding for more than two years and 

with no actual claims were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit 

account of the general fund as at year-end as authorized under Section 98 of PD 

No. 1445 and as directed under Executive Order (EO) No. 87 which overstated 

the account balance. 

 

Section 98 of PD No. 1445 states that “the head of agency concerned may revert 

to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any 

unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of national government, which 

has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, 

administrative or judicial.” 

 

Further, EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 directs that “all accounts payable 

which remain outstanding for two years or more in the books of national government 

agencies be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the general fund, or the 

Cumulative Result of Operations of the national government.” 

 

The year-end balance of the Accounts Payable of ₱29,779,125.78 pertained to 

obligations due to creditors/clients, regular employees and contract of service (COS) 

personnel for services rendered and goods received during the year and in prior years.  

The aging of the Accounts Payable account as follows: 

 

 Age Amount (₱) 

Less than 30 days – 1 year 16,325,870.25 

Over 1 year 6,469,699.63 

Over 2 years 82,900.17 

3 years and above 6,900,655.74 

Total 29,779,125.78 

  

Review of the details of Accounts Payable account showed that payables aged 

two years and above totaling ₱6,983,555.91 which remained outstanding, pertained 

to the following obligations for:  

  

1. unclaimed checks which became stale or were cancelled and for which no       
replacement checks were yet issued amounting to ₱141,626.51; 

  

2. claims of creditors/suppliers for services rendered, delivered goods, airfares, 
foods and hotel accommodations totaling ₱1,877,974.92; 



37 

 

  

3. claims/reimbursements of personnel for travelling/transportation, per diems, 
communication expenses and professional totaling ₱5,279,112.69 and 

 

4. negative balances amounting to (₱315,158.21) representing 
adjustments/erroneous postings in the set-up of the payable accounts, likewise 

erroneous posting/recording of settlement for payables thus, resulted to 

negative balances. 

  

Management informed that balances of the payables aged over two years and 

above totaling ₱6,983,555.91 which remained outstanding were not properly 

monitored due to lack of personnel.  The balances of the accounts are still for 

verification and confirmation of those creditors/claimants by management.  Likewise, 

it could not confirm yet the receipts of requests for the replacements of the staled 

checks from concerned creditors. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to:  

a) Review the above payables which have been outstanding for two years or 
more to establish the veracity of each account; 

 

b) Communicate or send confirmation to the concerned claimants on the 
amount due them. If the payees of those accounts can no longer be 

located/traced, revert those payables to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit in 

accordance with Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and EO No. 87. 

 

 

Delayed Submission of Accounting and Financial Reports

The Chief Accountant admitted that the incurred delays in the submission of CY 

2020 accounting and financial reports were due to COVID-19 pandemic and the 

implementation of the new work arrangement of NAPC officers and employees under   

various community quarantine.  

 

Considerations on the prescribed period were already taken into by the Audit 

Team due to the implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and 

Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) in response with the COVID-19 

pandemic, however, continuous delays were still incurred by management on  the 

submission of said reports contrary to Section 107 of PD No. 1445, COA Circular No. 

95-006 dated May 18, 1995, Sections 60, 32, 38 of Chapters 19, 3, 10 respectively, 

Volume I, of the GAM for NGAs and COA Circular 92-125A dated March 4, 1992, 

and COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thus affecting  the timely 

verification of reports, early detection of deficiencies and immediate communication 

to Management of the results of audit.  

 

Further, unjustified failure on the part of the official or employee concerned to 

submit the documents, accounting and financial reports mentioned herein shall be 

considered  a ground for the automatic suspension of payment of his/her salary until 

he/she shall have complied with the aforesaid requirements as imposed under Section 

122(2) of PD No. 1445.

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant as well as the Property/Supply Officer to submit the required 

accounting and financial reports within the prescribed period.  

 

Management acknowledged and apologized failure to submit the accounting and 

financial documents on the prescribed time because of the worsening situation of the 

COVID-19 pandemic and commit to submit said reports in soft copy to ensure that 

delays in the submission would be avoided. 

C. Other Areas 

COVID-19 Expenses 

7. No COVID-19 Fund was received by the agency however, they had incurred COVID-
19 related expenses such as payments of hazard pay, load allowances and purchases of 

alcohols, facemasks and Vitamins for CY 2020 that were charged to the regular fund 

of NAPC. 

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Program  

8. CY 2020 allocated budget and actual utilization for Gender and Development 
(GAD) Programs, Projects and Activities (PPAs) were less than 5 percent of the 

Agency Budget/Appropriations, thus, non-compliant with the required five 

percent under Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 (GAA FY 

2020).  Moreover, GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report 

(AR) still with Philippine Commission for Women (PCW) were not yet endorsed 

to Department of Budget and Management (DBM) contrary with Item 8.2 of 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 (GAA FY 2020) provides 

that Programs and Projects Related to Gender and Development, “All agencies of the 

government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA 

No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 

of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, The Philippine 

Plan for Gender-Responsive-Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine 

Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 

shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being 

undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty 

alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive 

governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of 

GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by 

said agencies.

During the year, NAPC’s GPB showed that the Management allocated 

₱7,653,171.00 or only 3.30 percent of the total appropriations of ₱232,221,000.00 

which was not compliant with Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 as 

shown on the table as follows: 

 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) Percentage of 

Appropriation 

Total Appropriations  232,221,000.00 100.00 

Should be allocation for GAD         11,611,050.00 5.00 

Amount Allocated      7,653,171.00 3.30 

Deficiency              3,957,879.00 1.70 

Total GAD actual utilization              4,323,176.00 1.86 

 

Pursuant to Item 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides 

that the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) of the agency shall submit the final GPB 

and the corresponding GAD AR to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM. 

 

Management was able to prepare and submit the duly approved and signed by 

the Agency Head GPB and AR to the PCW on April 5, 2021 using the online system 

of the PCW.  However, it was noted that the same were still for review of the PCW 

and that these were not yet endorsed to DBM. 

 

On the other hand, review of the AR for CY2020 disclosed the agency total 

utilization of ₱4,323,176.00 or 56 percent of the allocated amount of ₱7,653,171.00 

from the regular budget in the conduct of GAD activities. The agency implemented 

(16/18) 88 percent of its target GAD activities as shown on the AR submitted.  

  

According to the GFPS staff, the allocated GAD budget which was less than 

five percent of the agency’s total appropriations was due to adjustments made per 

advice of the Administrative and Finance Management Service (AFMS) in compliance 

with NBC No. 580 series of 2020 or the Adoption of Economy Measures in the 

Government due to the Emergency Health Situation (COVID 19 pandemic). 

 

Although the required allocation of fund was not met by the agency, we 

recognize the agency’s efforts and desires in undertaking the GAD activities and in 

accomplishing 88 percent of the agency’s GAD target activities despite the pandemic 

situation.  

 

We recommended that the Focal Person for GAD: 

 

a. Ensure compliance with the fund allocation relative to GAD-related 
activities as provided by the said law; and 

 

b. Ensure that GPB and AR were submitted, reviewed by PCW and endorsed 



42 

 

to DBM in compliance with the above regulations.

Management explained that no NCA was received for NTF-ELCAC Fund for 

CYs 2019-2020 nor receipt of Fund Transfer from DSWD. It was only confirmed 

during the budget hearing for CY 2021 that the release of NTF-ELCAC Fund was

However, verifications of accounting records had noted the disbursements
