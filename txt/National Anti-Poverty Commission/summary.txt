D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the NAPC for CY 2020.  It 

was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of NAPC as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The significant audit observations and recommendations, as shown below, 

were discussed with Management officials concerned. Management views and 

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. Receivable accounts amounting to ₱16,363,810.26 with no documents to support 
its validity and dormant for 19 years remained not written-off due to non-

submission by management of the required supporting documents thereof thus, 

affecting the fair presentation of the receivable accounts in the Financial 

Statements. (Paragraph No. 1) 

 

We reiterated the recommendation and Management agreed to submit   the proof 

of exhaustion of remedies as required by the OCD, so that the request for 

authority to write off may be given due course 

  

 

2. Five of the targeted seven priority Local Government Units (LGUs) were 
provided funds for initial tranche of ₱7,500,000.00 out of the actual target of 

₱10,500,000.00  to implement the 3S Prototype Project geared in developing 

locally based community enterprises as the two remaining LGUs failed to comply 

with the requirements set by NAPC under its Memorandum Order (MO) No. 



iv 

 

2019-10-087 relative to the Memorandum of Agreement with Philippine 

Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR).  (Paragraph No. 2) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a)  Communicate with the two remaining identified priority areas, and 
follow up the immediate completion and submission of LGU Cebu City 

of the requirements under NAPC MOA No. 2019-10-087, while for 

Calbayog, Samar, set a new date for the signing of MOA;  

 

b) Amend the timelines set in the Work and Financial Plan (WFP) to reflect 
the new timelines for the remaining activities of the project; and  

 

c)  Fast track the operation and implementation of the project to meet the 
target outcomes and outputs set in the PAGCOR-NAPC MOA. 

  

3. Deficiencies were noted in the granting and liquidation of Cash advances (CAs) 
granted to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) as (a) ₱1,756,565.11 remained 

unliquidated and had been outstanding for 91 to 821 days; and (b) ₱664,700.00 

were granted to several SDOs, without liquidating first their prior cash advances, 

likewise, contrary with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997 and Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445.  

(Paragraph No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) SDOs to liquidate immediately their CAs that were outstanding for more 
than two months or no longer needed and those granted after which their 

purpose of granting had been served, otherwise, direct the Accountant to 

cause the withholding of the salary of the concerned SDOs and refund 

immediately the unused balance upon submission of the liquidation 

reports; 

 

b) Chief Accountant to: 
 

 Avoid granting CAs to SDO with outstanding CAs or unsettled 
accountability; and  

 Send demand letter to the AOs/SDOs with unliquidated CAs or 
outstanding balances and if no action was undertaken by the latter, 

enforce the withholding of their salaries in accordance with Item 5.9 of 

COA Circular No. 97-002.  

 

4. Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of ₱4,198,979.01 remained 

undisposed contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and National Budget Circular 

(NBC) No. 425, resulting in further deterioration of the assets and depriving the 



v 

 

Agency of any benefit or income that may be derived from its disposal.  

Moreover, these items were not yet dropped from the books due to the failure of 

the Supply Officer to submit the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to the Accounting Unit for its derecognition, as 

provided under Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs. (Paragraph no. 4) 

 

We reiterated the recommendation that the Supply/Property Officer: 

 

a) Facilitate the immediate disposal of the unserviceable PPE in accordance 
with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and NBC No. 425 to avoid 

accumulation of unserviceable PPEs stored in the premises of NAPC; 

and 

 

b) Submit to the Chief Accountant the IIRUP for the recognition of the 
Impairment Loss-PPE in accordance with Section 40(d), Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

5. Out of the Accounts Payable balance as at December 31, 2020 amounting to 
₱29,779,125.78, ₱6,983,555.91 remained outstanding for more than two years and 

with no actual claims were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit 

account of the general fund as at year-end as authorized under Section 98 of PD 

No. 1445 and as directed under Executive Order (EO) No. 87 which overstated 

the account balance.   (Paragraph No. 5) 

 

We recommended that the Chief Accountant: 

 

a) Review the above payables which have been outstanding for two years 
or more to establish the veracity of each account; 

 

b) Communicate or send confirmation to the concerned claimants on the 
amount due them. If the payees of those accounts can no longer be 

located/traced, revert those payables to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit 

in accordance with Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and EO No. 87. 

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 13 audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), eight were implemented and five were not implemented. Details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
