PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 
 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. The Property,  Plant and Equipment  ( PPE) accounts of the Philippine Council  
for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) had misstatements totaling ₱16.587 

million which represent 0.84 percent of its total assets of ₱1,966.247 million, while 

the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account had misstatements of ₱21.056 million or 

1.88 percent of its total equity of ₱1,121.170 million. Due to the significant effect of 

such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s 

assertions as to the accuracy, existence, completeness and classification of the      said 

accounts could not be relied upon. 

 

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, state 

that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and 

financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements 

are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash 

flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making   and evaluating decisions 

about the allocation of resources.” The standards further state that specifically, the 

objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide 

information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity 

for the resources entrusted to it. 

 

3. Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 provides that Financial Statements (FSs) shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 

and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 

liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with 

additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in FSs that achieve a   fair 

presentation. 
 

4. Our audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions resulting in misstatements 
in the PPE and Equity accounts reported in the FSs of the PCHRD as summarized in Table

2019, re: “Determining and Using Materiality Thresholds in Financial Audit.” 

 

 Details of accounting errors and omissions 

         
Misstatements in the PPE Accounts 

 

a) Recorded PPEs totaling ₱15,354,817.40 remained unaccounted/untraceable as at 
year-end: 

 

6. Previously included in the Annual Audit Report (AAR) on the PCHRD for CY 
2019, the Technical and Scientific Equipment totaling ₱15,354,817.40 remained 

unaccounted and untraceable even as at December 31, 2020. These PPEs were procured 

and issued by the Implementing Agencies (IAs) between 1984 and 2002, before the 

implementation of the eNGAs, wherein the related documents of said equipment, such as 

the Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) and List of Equipment Report, were 

likewise missing. The possibility for the Accountant and the Property Unit staff to trace 

and reconcile the unaccounted equipment as the first practical step to reconcile their records 

had been hindered by the on-going onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, this 

observation continues to affect the fair presentation of the PCHRD’s financial statements 

(FS). 
 

b) Inaccuracies in the computation of depreciation totaling ₱1,232,234.67 
 

7. Pursuant to Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, the Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE) gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. 

Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. 

The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is called 

depreciation. 
 

8. The preceding provision also states that “depreciation of an asset begins when it is 
available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be 

capable of operating in the manner intended by management.  For simplicity and to avoid 

proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE is available for 

use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 

15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month.” 

 

9. Meanwhile, Section 27(i) provides that “a residual value equivalent to at least five 
percent (5%) of the cost shall be adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is 

determined by the entity based on its operation subject to the approval of COA.” 

 

10. The computation of monthly depreciation expense shall be cost less residual value 
divided by the estimated useful life (in months). Thus, in theory, accumulated depreciation 

of an asset cannot exceed its carrying value, and the book value of each PPE item should 

at least be equal to the residual value at the end of its useful life. 

 

11. Analysis of PPE Schedules as at December 31, 2020, revealed that there were 



32 
 

inaccuracies in the computation of depreciation in some PPE items due to the leniency in 

the keeping of the accounts of the Accounting Section. Some PPEs were either not provided 

with depreciation, under-depreciated or over-depreciated. 

 

 Non-recording of depreciation 
 

12. We noted that no depreciation was recorded in the subsidiary ledger for five (5) 
ICT Equipment with a total cost and net book value of ₱321,830.00 and ₱62,372.18, 

respectively, as at year-end. The breakdown of which is shown in Table 3:

 Overstatement in the Net Book Value as of 12/31/2020 (₱321,830.00 less ₱62,372.18) ₱259,457.83 

 
13. As can be gleaned from the table above, the acquisition costs were still equal to 
their net book values even though items 1 to 4 were fully depreciated given their acquisition 

dates. For fully depreciated PPE, the book value should have been at least equal to the 

residual value (5%) at the end of its useful life. Our inquiry from the Accounting Section 

revealed that this was due to system error wherein these PPEs, although included in the 

list, were, however, not applied with the correct depreciation and due to their leniency in 

keeping their records, the errors were not discovered and corrected.  

  

14. The non-recording of depreciation resulted in the understatement of Depreciation 
Expenses and Accumulated Depreciation and the overstatement of ICT Equipment by 

₱259,457.83 and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) at year-end. 

 

 Under-depreciation of PPEs 
 

15. Likewise provided in the said Section 27, a residual value equivalent to at least five 
percent (5%) of the cost shall be adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is 

determined by the entity based on its operation subject to the approval of COA. Prior to 

the implementation of the GAM, residual value was estimated at ten percent (10%).  
 



33 
 

16. The PPE Schedules, however, show that the net book values of certain fully 
depreciated PPEs are not equal or not even close to the prescribed residual value in the 

GAM. As shown in Table 4, the net book values of the following fully depreciated PPEs 

range from 46% up to 89% of their costs:

17. The percentages shown in the Table above indicate that there were understatements 
in the computation of accumulated depreciation. If the residual value of 5% is to be 

considered in the computation of these fully depreciated assets, there would be an 

understatement in the Accumulated Depreciation and overstatement in the total net book 

value of said PPEs of ₱1,163,728.85 as at year-end, as shown below:

18. On the other hand, we observed that in some PPEs, acquisition costs were not 
considered in the computation of net book value, hence, this resulted in the negative 

balances of Accumulated Depreciation, as shown in Table 5:

19. Furthermore, we noticed that there were negative balances in the net book values 
reflected in the PPE Schedules due to overstatement in the computation of accumulated

20. It must be noted that in no case shall the accumulated depreciation of an asset 
exceed its carrying value.

21. The PCHRD’s failure to submit RPCPPE, update PCs and eventually conduct 
reconciliation of PPE balances between the Accounting and Property/Supply records, 

inclusion of untraceable PPEs in the books, and the inaccuracies in the computation of 

depreciation affected the existence, accuracy and reliability of the PPE balances reported 

in the FS. 

 

22. In summary, the total effect of incorrect computation of depreciation amounted to 
(₱1,232,234.67) as shown in Table 7:

23. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to:  
 

i. immediately submit the RPCPPE for CY 2020, pursuant to Section 
38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I;  

 

ii. exert efforts to reconcile and locate/trace the whereabouts of several 
Technical and Scientific Equipment as reported in the books of the 

PCHRD, and thereafter, conduct a regular reconciliation of records; 

and 

 

iii. henceforth, conduct the reconciliation of PPE balances reported in 
the RPCPPE with the General Ledger, investigate any discrepancy 

noted and make corresponding adjustments, if warranted;  

 

b. The Property/Supply Officer to maintain PC for each PPE category and 
thereafter, update postings in the PCs; and 

 

c. The Accountant to re-compute and record the proper depreciation for the 
accounts Office Equipment, ICT Equipment and Furniture and Fixtures in 

accordance with Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

c. Payments of honoraria with a total amount of ₱4.469 million were erroneously 
classified to account Consultancy Services, hence, affecting the fair presentation of 



36 
 

the account balances in the financial statements. 

 

24. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, also known as the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (RCA) - Updated 2019, states that “Honoraria account shall be debited 

to recognize the payment given to professionals for services in recognition of their 

expertise, broad and superior knowledge in specific fields and special projects.  This also 

includes payments to lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in 

seminars, training programs and other similar activities in training institutions including 

those who render services beyond their regular workload”. 

 

25. On the other hand, in the same COA Circular, it also provides that “Consultancy 
Services shall be debited to recognize the cost of services rendered by consultants 

contracted to perform particular outputs or services primarily advisory in nature and 

requiring highly specialized or technical expertise which cannot be provided by the regular 

staff of the agency”. 

 

26. Verification of records showed that the payment to personnel assigned in special 
projects acting as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in seminars, 

training programs and other similar activities in training institutions including those who 

render services beyond their regular workload were improperly recognized as Consultancy 

Services instead of Honoraria which befittingly define the transactions in question charged 

against the earlier account. The error in recording to the Consultancy Services by the 

Accounting Section, which is supposed to be intended for highly specialized or technical 

expertise, resulted in the improper classification of expenses totaling ₱4,468,715.14, which 

ultimately overstated the accounts Consultancy Services and understated Honoraria 

account by the same said amount. 

 

27. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
observe consistency in the recording of transactions, and properly classify the 

expenses to the Honoraria account following the Revised Chart of Accounts. 

 
Accounting Deficiencies 

 

28. The Due to NGAs and Due to GOCCs accounts with total value of ₱410.603 
million as at December 31, 2020, remained unaccounted due to completed projects 

without supporting documentary requirements, unidentified projects labelled as 

“various,” and non-reconciliation of balances between the Source Agencies (SA) and 

Implementing Agencies (IAs); thus, affecting Management assertions on the 

existence, accuracy, validity, classification and completeness of the reported account 

balances. 

 

29. PCHRD, as the national coordinating body for health research, is committed to 
mobilize resources to support health research for various Grant-in-Aid (GIA) 

programs/projects funded by its own appropriation as well as funds from other government 

agencies and government-owned and controlled corporations.  As at December 31, 2020, 

the PCHRD’s records consisted of, among others, fund transfers (FTs) sourced from the

Department of Health (DOH), Department of Science and Technology-Office of the 

Secretary (DOST-OSEC), Technological Application and Promotion Institute (TAPI), and 

Food and Drug Administration, and the PhilHealth amounting to ₱836,965,601.31 under 

the accounts Due to NGAs and Due to GOCCs, the details of which are shown in Table 8.

6.  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY  

 



38 
 

6.4 within five (5) days after the end of each month, the Accountable 

Officer (AO) shall prepare the RCI and the RD and shall submit them 

with all supporting vouchers/payrolls and documents to the Accountant.  

These reports shall be approved by the Head of the Agency; 

 

6.5 within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall 

verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the 

duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls 

and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor.  The Accountant shall 

ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the Reports.  He 

shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the SA (Attention: The 

SA Accountant). 

 

31. Despite the above provisions, the PCHRD’s unexpended balance of accounts Due 
to NGAs and Due to GOCCs has reached an overwhelming accumulated total of 

₱836,965,601.31 as at December 31, 2020, from the balances of ₱558,685,932.08 and 

₱447,172,821.18 for the years ending in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 

32. It was found that the PCHRD, as the Implementing Agency (IA) of the GIA-funded 
projects, had been lenient in adhering to their duties and responsibilities as stated in the 

said COA Circular No. 94-013 that monthly Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of 

Disbursements (RD) shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer and verified by the 

Accountant and recorded in the books of the IA. As such, the unavailability of documentary 

requirements for the used project funds remained the main cause for the non-liquidation, 

and the balance of the accounts Due to NGAs and Due to GOCCs continue to increase year 

after year because of additional new projects being entered with the SAs.  The FTs with 

completed projects but with no supporting documents as at December 31, 2020, is 

presented in Table 9.

33. These unliquidated completed projects were further caused by the lack of 
commitment of the Project Personnel to rigorously monitor and collate the documentary 

requirements. Further, the Accountant’s failure to demand for the liquidation of the funds 

with completed projects and the immediate return of the unutilized balance to the SAs 

likewise contributed to the increasing trend of unliquidated funds on the completed projects 

under these payable accounts.  
 

34. Moreover, the balance also included the amount of ₱23,975,757.39, representing 
unfinished projects which were already beyond the target completion date. The status of 

these projects, as shown in Table 10, are still on-going and were not reported in the  

Publicized Government Programs/ Projects/ Activities (GPPA) report as at December 31, 

2020.  The same had no Audited Financial Report submitted to this office.

35. Thus, the unliquidated funds of the completed projects of ₱89,232,649.52 tainted 
with unfinished projects ₱23,975,757.39 which were not reported in the PCHRD’s GPPA 

cast doubts on the accuracy, classification, reliability, and completeness of the reported 

balances in the Financial Statements. 

 

b) Unaccounted/unidentified Projects ₱54,210,742.87 
 

36. Sections 111 and 112 of PD 1445 also provide that, “the accounts of the agency 
shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same 



40 
 

time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 

government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 

observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading 

information. xxx (underscoring supplied).” 

 

37. As at year-end, based on the schedule of Due to NGAs, the amount of 
₱54,210,742.87 was unaccounted for.  Information such as the Source Agencies (SAs) and 

the balances of each account were not presented in the schedule and were classified only 

as “various”. Correspondingly, the Accounting Section did not maintain Subsidiary 

Ledgers (SLs) of these accounts; hence, these are unidentified, contrary to Sections 111 

and 112 of PD 1445. The lack of prudent monitoring, reconciliation and documentation of 

the deficiencies in the PCHRD’s records and financial reports, resulted in the unreliability 

and inaccurate reported Due to NGAs balances in the financial statements.   

 

c) Unreconciled balances between SA and IA records amounted to ₱267,159,422.29 

38. Examination of the Due to NGAs and Due to GOCCs account balances of 
₱805,697,066.19 and ₱31,268,535.62, respectively, as at December 31, 2020, received 

from various source agencies (SAs) for the implementation of projects showed a difference 

of ₱267,159,422.29, between the records of the PCHRD and the SAs, as shown in Table 

11.

39. The PCHRD’s lack of regular reconciliation of records and balances with the SAs  
caused the growing disparity of these payables, such that as at December 31, 2019, the 

difference was P103,668,423.21 as compared to this year’s P 267,159,422.29 variance. In 

addition, Management pointed out some of the causes of the difference in the balances as 

follows: 
 

a. Timing difference in recording the liquidation of the PCHRD in 
the books of the SAs; 

b. Timing difference in recording the fund transfers of SAs in the 
books of the PCHRD; 



41 
 

c. Unrecorded prior years’ liquidation of the PCHRD in the SAs’ 
books despite submission of Financial Reports; 

d. Balances in the books of the SAs are not available or provided. 
 

40. Nevertheless, the PCHRD’s effort to reconcile their balances vis-à-vis SAs did not 
correct the balances noted as the condition of the unaccounted balances still existed as at 

December 31, 2020; thus, continuously affecting the reliability, accuracy and existence of 

the affected accounts. 
  

41. We recommended and  Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the timely submission of documentary requirements and initiate 
the liquidation of unliquidated balances of fund transfers and the 

immediate refund of unexpended balances of completed projects to the SA 

as at December 31, 2020; 

 

b. henceforth, strictly comply with Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of COA Circular No. 
94-013 dated December 13, 1994, and Section X.C.4 of DOST AO No. 11, 

series of 2020, dated September 2, 2020; for Grants-in-Aid projects, to 

return immediately the unexpended balance within three (3) months after 

completion of the project period;  

 

c. require project leaders of unfinished projects to justify the delayed 
implementation of the projects and henceforth, follow strictly the approved 

activities as reflected in the work plan as required in Section  X.A.4 of 

DOST  AO No. 11, series of 2020, dated September 2, 2020; 

 

d. analyze the breakdown/composition of the unaccounted balances of the 
Due to NGAs accounts versus records of the project personnel to 

adequately present complete information of the account balances and 

thereafter, thorough monitoring of the succeeding similar transactions; 

and 

 

e. expedite the reconciliation of the PCHRD’s Due to NGAs account balances 
vis-à-vis SA’s records to establish the correct amount. 

 

42. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements of ₱16.587 million and ₱21.056 million which represent 0.84 percent and 

1.88 percent of the agency’s total assets and equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies 

of ₱410.603 million or 48.59 percent of its total liabilities, we rendered a Qualified Opinion 

on the financial statements of the PCHRD as at year-end.    

 

 

 

 

 



42 
 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

43. Management’s insufficient project monitoring, leniency in requiring 
liquidation of FTs/refund of unexpended balances, and non-provision of sanctions to 

IAs/Project Leaders for non-submission of reports/non-liquidation of FTs for 

completed research projects resulted in the increase of unliquidated FTs recorded 

under Due from NGAs, Due from NGOs/POs, and Other Receivables, by 102 percent 

from last year’s ₱621,577,156.38 to ₱1,257,232,034.81 as at year-end. 

 

44. The FTs are covered with Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) that identify the 
PCHRD as the SA and the recipient government agencies, Non-Government Organization/ 

Private Organizations (NGOs/POs) and private institutions to which the researcher or 

project leader is connected as the IAs. The MOAs provide that the IAs shall be responsible 

for the execution of the project and shall submit the required Technical/Financial and 

Terminal Reports in order to account for the utilization of the grant, while the PCHRD 

shall be in charge of the evaluation, monitoring and assessment of the projects. 

 

45. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, sets forth the rules and 
regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to IAs to ensure that 

the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the SAs and the IAs, the transferred funds 

are used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made of 

the utilization of the funds. 

  

46. The relevant provisions of the afore-cited Circular are as follows: 
 

a. Item 4.6 requires that within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of 
the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks 

Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursements to report the utilization of funds. 

Only the actual project expenses shall be reported and the report to be approved 

by the Head of the IA.  

 

b. Item 4.9 further requires that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance 
upon completion of the project.  

 

c. Item 5.4 mandates that the SA shall require the IA to submit the reports and 
furnish the IA with a copy of the journal entry voucher taking up the 

expenditures. 

 

47. On the other hand, COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, provides 
the guidelines in the granting, utilization, accounting and auditing of the funds released to 

NGOs/POs for the implementation of government projects. Section 5.4 requires that 

“within sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the 

Fund Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its 

President/Chairman to the Government Organizations (GOs), together with the inspection 

report and certificate of project completion rendered/issued by the GO authorized 

representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/acknowledgement of the 

project/funds/goods/services received. The validity of these documents shall be verified by 



43 
 

the internal auditor or equivalent official of the GO and shall be the basis of the GO in 

recording the fund utilization in its books of accounts. These documents shall support the 

liquidation of funds granted to the NGO/PO.” 

 

48. The PCHRD transferred funds to its partners using the accounts Due from NGAs, 
Due from NGOs/POs or Other Receivables. As at December 31, 2020, these accounts had 

a total balance of  P1,696,691,719.41 of which P1,257,232,034.81 or 74 percent pertained 

to 538 completed projects aging from one (1) year to 19 years, as reflected in the year-end 

schedules of the PCHRD’s receivables, as shown in Table 13:

50. The aging result of the CY 2020 completed projects bears a similarity to the CY 
2019 observation with 83 percent increase from the previous year or 473 completed 

projects totaling ₱621,577,156.38 remained unliquidated. As at December 31, 2020, the 



44 
 

unliquidated amounts increased by 102 percent, manifesting Management’s inadequate 

measures to enforce the settlement of prior years’ balances as well as those for projects 

newly completed in CY 2020.

51. The recurrence of this observation reflects the PCHRD’s lack of strict enforcement 
of the guidelines on the GIA Program under DOST Administrative Order (AO) No. 009, 

series of 2017, dated November 9, 2017, where it specifically states under Section 8.3.d.v 

that “upon the project completion/termination, all balances/savings and income/interest 

shall be reported and reverted to the Funding Agency within three (3) months after the end 

of the project period. Section 6.3.6 further provides that for failure to submit within six (6) 

months the required financial, technical and other reports after the prescribed deadlines, 

demand letters shall be sent to the Project Leader and Head of the Agency of the IA.” The 

same provision is also cited in the Revised GIA Guideline under Section X.C.4 and 5, 

DOST AO No. 11, series of 2020, dated September 2, 2020. 

 

52. Guided with the aforementioned ruling, the PCHRD had the capacity to require the 
full liquidation of previous releases by the concerned IAs before subsequent fund releases 

were made. 

 

53. In the prior years, the following were among the actions taken by Management in 
order to reduce the balance of unliquidated fund transfers:  

 

a. Implementation of Project Monitoring System (PMS) – an online submission, 
review, approval and monitoring platform for health research 

proposals/projects;  

b. Strict enforcement of the provisions stated in the MOA;  
c. Meetings with the project leaders, proponents and finance officers of the 

implementing institutions to reiterate the liquidation of their long outstanding 

balances;  

d. Continuous issuance of demand letters to IAs with long outstanding balances;  
e. For ongoing projects, Accounting and Budget Sections to deduct the 

unexpended balance of the previous fund release from the succeeding request 

of fund release by the proponents or project leaders;  

f. Close coordination between the Accounting and Technical Divisions (i.e., 
Accounting Unit provides financial monitoring reports to Project Officers on 

a monthly basis); and  

g. Implementation of the new policy of the DOST, wherein the smallest unit of 
the IAs will be prohibited to request additional fund releases when previous 



45 
 

completed projects remain unsettled. 

 

54. Upon validation, however, the actions of Management remained to be insufficient 
for the following reasons: 

 

a. the PMS did not include all projects funded/monitored by the PCHRD, 
particularly those projects that have been long outstanding;  

b. there was leniency in the submission of progress reports by the concerned 
Project Officers; 

c. absence of sanctions in the MOA in case of an IA’s non-compliance; and 
d. demand letters were not completely issued to all IAs with long outstanding 

balances. 

 

55.  Moreover, the increased funds for R&D and the pandemic also contributed to the 
significant increase in the number of unliquidated fund transfers for the year. 

    

56. The inadequate project monitoring and the leniency in requiring timely liquidation 
of FTs and refund of unexpended balances resulted not only in the accumulation of long 

outstanding balances but these also gave the impression that projects which were reported 

as completed have not actually been completed, thus, the possible wastage of government 

funds. 

 

57. We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the responsible Project Officers/Division Chiefs to identify and 
closely/regularly monitor the programs/projects which were the subject of 

FTs/grants and strictly enforce the provisions of DOST AO No. 11, s. 2020, 

on the reporting requirements and liquidation of the grants;  

 

b. exhaust all possible remedies to compel the IAs to liquidate their long 
outstanding balances and return the excess funds therefrom;  

 

c. require the concerned Technical Divisions to send demand letters to 
IAs/Project Leaders with long outstanding balances, stating definite 

deadlines for submission of the required reports and the possible legal 

actions that may be instigated against them in case of non-compliance; 

  

d. stop releasing funds to IAs with unliquidated FTs, specifically those with 
completed projects, and/or initiate legal measures against Project Leaders 

with unsettled completed projects;  

 

e. if concerned NGOs/POs continuously fail to liquidate the funds entrusted 
them, institute legal action against them for violating Section 5.4 of COA 

Circular No. 2007-001; and 

  

f. henceforth, require the Accounting and Technical Divisions to 
coordinate/collaborate with each other, specifically on the submission of 



46 
 

documents and the refund of the excess amount of the completed projects 

of the IAs. 

Deficiencies Noted in the Project Expenses of AHEAD Project 

 

58. DOST Administrative Order (AO) No. 009 s. 2017 dated November 9, 2017 
was not faithfully followed on account of the following: (a) disbursement of project 

funds for CY 2020 and beyond after the duration of the projects, contrary to Sections 

VIII.3 and 3.d.iv; and (b) amount allotted for Indirect Expenses of ₱10.578 million in 

place of ₱0.300 million maximum allowable indirect cost, in violation of Section VII 

b.ii. 
 

59. The fund transfer from the Department of Health (DOH) to the PCHRD for the 
project Advancing Health Through Evidence-Assisted Decisions (AHEAD) was covered 

with an undated Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), notarized on December 28, 2018, 

identifying the PCHRD as the operating body of the Philippine National Health Research 

System (PNHRS) being the Secretariat as per RA 10532, or An Act Institutionalizing the 

Philippine National Health Research System, and mandated to provide administrative 

support services in the following areas: (1) research and development management, (2) 

institution development, (3) research information communication and utilization, and (4) 

finance and administration.  

 

60. The MOA provided that the PCHRD shall be responsible for the following: 
 

Component I 

a) Facilitate call for proposals, technical evaluation, ethics review, and 
monitoring of research grants; 

b) Engage research institutions through grants agreements; 
c) Allocate and release the research project funds in conformity with 

DOST Administrative Order No.009 Series of 2017 dated November 9, 

2017; 

d) Provide Technical assistance relevant to the achievement of the project 
objectives; and  

e)  Assign project officers to monitor projects. 

Component II 

a) Work in collaboration with DOH to prepare a program design for 
health policy and systems research fellows; 

b) Facilitate strategic recruitment of health policy and system research 
fellows; 

c) Engage health policy and systems research fellows through fellowship; 
d) Allocate and release monthly stipend, subject to availability of funds 

and existing government accounting and auditing rules, and withhold 

from the stipend the applicable taxes in accordance with the Philippine 

tax laws; 



47 
 

e) Allocate and release financial support to research fellows to cover cost 
of research project, ethics review, representation, traveling and other 

incidental expenses relative to the conduct of their research, subject to 

availability of funds and existing government accounting and auditing 

rules; 

f) Deploy health policy and systems research fellows to relevant DOH 
units or other relevant agencies based on Program Design. 

Component III 

a) Record and apply consistent accounting procedures sufficient to 
properly and separately reflect all transactions; 

b) Engage sufficient research Management staff to facilitate timely 
completion of deliverables;  

c) Assume direct responsibility for managing funds by ensuring that funds 
are disbursed properly and in timely manner and supporting 

documents are properly maintained and regularly updated, and 

financial reports are prepared in accordance with DOH’s 

requirements; and financial operations are transparent and financial 

procedures/regulations are properly applied; and 

d) Provide regular updates on all ongoing research projects. 
 

61. The MOA also provided that the DOH shall release the funds amounting to 
₱301,089,000.00 to the PCHRD, subject to the usual government accounting and auditing 

rules and regulations.  Accordingly, the MOA shall take effect upon signing by both parties 

and shall remain effective for (1) one year.   

   

62. Verification of the liquidation reports for the project AHEAD showed that the DOH 
had released the total amount of ₱301,089,000.01 to the PCHRD, and recorded in its books 

as payable under the Due to NGAs account. Out of the said amount, ₱224,130,103.20 was 

allocated for research/grants projects and the remaining ₱76,958,896.81, as PCHRD’s 

disbursements. Review further revealed the following observations: 

 

a) Disbursement of project funds after the duration of the project. 
 

63. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between  the DOH and the PCHRD 
stipulates the following:  

 

“Section 6.  Validity 

 

This Memorandum of Agreement shall take effect upon signing by both Parties 

hereto and shall remain effective for one (1) year.  This agreement will not be 

modified or altered or amended except by the mutual agreement of both parties 

expressed in writing. 

 

 

 



48 
 

Section 8.  Program Delays 

 

Except for delays resulting from circumstances beyond the control of the parties, 

such as, but not limited to, force majeure and others of similar nature, no extension 

of PROJECT period shall be allowed.   

 

Where such uncontrollable situations, however arise, extension may be allowed at 

no additional cost. In instances when the DOH fails to meet its obligations to 

PCHRD, PCHRD will be granted a no cost extension equivalent to the length 

caused by DOH.  In instances when PCHRD request for no cost extensions, only a 

maximum of 2 no cost-extensions may be granted.” 

 

64. On the other hand, DOST AO No. 009 s. of 2017 dated November 9, 2017, also 
stipulates the following provisions: 

 

“VIII.  Grant Administration 

 

2. Program Extension 

 

c.v. If request for extension involves the use of unexpended balance, financial 

report or statement of fund balances as of date of request should be submitted 

not later than one (1) month before the expected date of completion. (See 

Section VIII.3.d.iv) 

 

3. Financial Monitoring  

 

The DOST-GIA funds released to implementing agencies shall be available for 

use within the approved project duration including approved extension subject 

to DOST approval and existing government accounting and auditing rules and 

regulations. 

 

d.iv. Request to use the UB/savings to continue project implementation shall be 

submitted within one (1) month before the expected date of completion. It shall 

be supported with FR and valid justification to be used as basis in preparing a 

new or revised LIB.” 

 

65. In the absence of both parties’ signing date, the MOA notarization date substituted 
the reckoning date of the agreement which is December 28, 2018, hence, disbursements of 

the project funds by the PCHRD should stop after December 28, 2019.   

 

66. Our examination of the approved Line Item Budget (LIB) revealed that the 
computed Personal Services (PS) totalling P31,215,045.61 far exceeded the twelve-month 

need to pay the services of 27 personnel, an overstatement of the budget by 

P19,259,932.81, see Table I6.  It  only showed that the project period would go beyond the 

agreed period of project implementation of one (1) year, thus, the deliberate slow-phased 

execution of the project.

67. Further, the disbursements for the project for CY 2020, revealed that the PCHRD 
continued to disburse the funds beyond the completion date of December 28, 2019. The 

PCHRD had expended for CY 2020 a total of ₱15,898,405.83, as shown in Table 17.

Total P15,898,405.83 

 

68. Section 8 of the MOA plainly specifies that except for delays resulting from 
circumstances beyond the control of the parties, such as, but not limited to, force majeure 

and others of similar nature, no extension of project period shall be allowed. That in case 

of delay due to uncontrollable situations, a maximum of two (2) extensions for a total of 

six (6) months for no cost extensions may be granted.  
 

69. The PCHRD claimed that the MOA was amended for a multi-year project, 
however, no amendment was submitted to COA bearing the extension period of January 1, 

2020 to December 30, 2020, instead the PCHRD furnished the COA Team an approved 

extension of project period from December 31, 2020 up to June 30, 2021 or six (6) months 

extension. The approved extension seemed to warrant the preceding one (1) year period 

without the approval of the DOH, the authority for project implementation; thus, the 

stipulation in the approved extension shall likewise be applied that the extension will not 

result in additional cost, in which the PCHRD still continues to disburse the project funds 

with the presumption that no additional cost denotes that no funds will be released from 

the funding agency or from the DOH. 
 

70. Section VIII.3. of AO No. 009 s. of 2017 dated November 9, 2017, as quoted in 



50 
 

paragraph 64, “funds released to implementing agencies shall be available for use within 

the approved duration of the project,” it clearly implies that after the approved duration of 

the project which is for one (1) year only, the funds shall no longer be available for 

disbursement, while Sections VIII2.c.v. and VIII.3.d.iv., also quoted in paragraph 64 states 

that “the use of unexpended balance shall be requested all together with the request for 

extension of the project.” 

 

71. Anchoring on the above regulations, the unexpended balance can no longer be 
disbursed after the duration of the program extensions. 

 

72. The continuous disbursement of funds beyond the duration of the project and 
without the request to use the unexpended balance resulted in over-expending of project 

funds which may be considered irregular.   
 

73. We recommended that Management submit written justifications on the 
continuous disbursement of project funds despite the expiration of the MOA and a 

no cost-extension, and/or amendments mutually agreed by both parties for our 

evaluation, before an action in audit may be undertaken. 

 

b) Amount allotted for Indirect Expenses amounting to ₱10,577,633.60, violates Section 
VII b.ii of DOST AO 009 dated November 9, 2017. 

 
74. Section VII b.ii of DOST AO 009 dated November 9, 2017, states that “the 
Implementing Agency and Monitoring Agency shall each retain an indirect cost, equivalent 

to 7.5% on PS and MOOE less Taxes, Duties and Licenses. For projects that are primarily 

on S&T promotion, policy advocacy, human resource development and capacity-building, 

the indirect cost shall not exceed three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00) unless 

otherwise allowed by the Funding Agency, subject to submission of substantiation as to 

increased costs based on scope, complexity and geographic coverage.”  

 

75. Per verification of the LIB attached to the MOA between the PCHRD and the DOH, 
we noted that the amount allotted for indirect expenses totaled ₱10,577,633.60 (Table 18) 

or 13.74 percent of the total allotted expenses for PS and MOOE (₱76,958,896.81). As 

stated on the above provision of DOST AO No. 009, indirect cost should be 7.5 percent of 

PS and MOOE and shall not exceed ₱300,000.00, thus, the amount allotted by Management 

for indirect cost exceeded by ₱10,277,633.60 (₱10,577,633.60- ₱300,000.00) contrary to 

the above stated provision.

Subtotal           10,577,633.60  

 
76. The amount allotted in the above summary, resulted in excess disbursements of 
indirect expenses allowed per Section VII b.ii of DOST AO 009 dated November 9, 2017. 

 

77. We recommended that Management submit to the Audit Team the amended 
MOA, particularly on the project extensions beyond the one-year period, if any, 

including the amendments to LIB agreed by both parties; and henceforth, strictly 

comply with the provisions set under DOST Administrative Order No. 009 s. of 2017 

dated November 9, 2017, in allotting indirect expenses. 

 

Management Comment 

 

78. Management commented that the 2018 AHEAD is a program funded by the DOH 
whose funds are not considered grants-in-aid and beyond the scope/coverage of the DOST 

AO No. 009, s. 2017. They claimed that the preparation and realignment of LIB (which 

includes the determination of amount to be allotted for PS, MOOE and Indirect Cost) and 

extension of duration of the program itself are not covered by the DOST GIA guidelines. 

 

79. Moreover, Management commented that the projects under the 2018 AHEAD to 
be managed by the PCHRD are specifically the research grants covered by the said 

guidelines. 
 

80. Further, they commented that the program is set for one (1) year duration but later 
amended to align with the implementation period of its activities and projects. On 19 

December 2019, the DOH approved the amendment. 

 

 



52 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 

81. We maintain our stand that the 2018 AHEAD project fund amounting to P301 
million, of which ₱224 million was allocated for research grants, is covered by the DOST 

guideline.  

 

82. Quoted under the definition of terms that “Grants-In-Aid (GIA) - refers to funds 
allocated to programs/projects by the DOST and its particular grant-giving agencies, 

including its Regional Offices and Sectoral Councils,” meaning, the GIA is not exclusive 

for programs funded by DOST but also by those funded by other agencies (such as the 

DOH).  To emphasize, the MOA specifically stated the phrase “to allocate and release the 

project funds in conformity with DOST AO N0.009 s. 2017”; thus, the whole amount 

released for the 2018 AHEAD from DOH is covered by the said DOST AO.    
 

83. Moreover, the LIB which is an attachment to the MOA should be agreed upon by 
both contracting parties before changes and realignments be made, hence, expenses 

presented therein should be followed which are subject to government accounting and 

auditing regulations specifically COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 and 

other pertinent rules and regulations.   
 

84. On the other hand, on the extensions of the programs, it was also specifically 
provided under Section 8 of the MOA:  

 

“Except for delays resulting from circumstances beyond the control of the parties, 

such as, but not limited to, force majeure and others of similar nature, no extension 

of PROJECT period shall be allowed.   

 

Where such uncontrollable situations, however arise, extension may be allowed at 

no additional cost. In instances when the DOH fails to meet its obligations to 

PCHRD, PCHRD will be granted a no cost extension equivalent to the length 

caused by DOH.  In instances when PCHRD request for no cost extensions, only a 

maximum of 2 no cost-extensions may be granted.” 

 

85. Accordingly, we stand by our observations and the corresponding 
recommendations.  

 

Publication of Innovative Startup Act paid thru Other Projects Trust Funds  

 

86. The publication of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic 
Act No. 11337 or the “Innovative Startup Act” in the Official Gazette and in the 

national dailies, amounting to ₱0.225 million, charged against the PhilHealth 

STUDIES and AHEAD programs’ funds, contravened the intended undertakings 

stated in the MOA of the said programs, hence, deemed irregular under Section 3.0 

of COA Circular No. 2012-003. 
 

87. Section 3.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defined 
Irregular Expenditures as those incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, 

procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. 



53 
 

Irregular Expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with 

prescribed usages and rules of discipline. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates 

or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A 

transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, 

irregular. 

 

88. Republic Act No. 11337 or the “Innovative Startup Act” was signed into law on 
April 26, 2019, which aims to strengthen, promote, and develop an innovative and 

entrepreneurial ecosystem and culture in the Philippines. Further, it focuses on providing 

benefits and removing constraints in order to encourage the establishment and operation of 

innovative new enterprises and businesses crucial to their growth and expansion. As such, 

the DTI, DOST, and DICT, as lead host agencies, have to closely coordinate and monitor 

programs and other forms of support for startups and startup enablers. The related 

Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) was approved on November 22, 2019. 

 

89. Audit of Printing and Publication Expenses account, with a year-end balance of 
₱1,582,204.48, disclosed that the publications of the IRR of RA 11337 or the “Innovative 

Startup Act” in the Official Gazette and in the national dailies amounting to ₱224,971.32 

were charged against the PhilHealth STUDIES and AHEAD programs’ funds, as shown 

below: 
 

LDDAP No. Fund Source Source Agency Amount 

994-02-051-2020 dated 
02/24/2020 

PhilHealth STUDIES PHIC 104,978.16

03/05/2020 

PhilHealth STUDIES PHIC 7,507.50 

AHEAD HSPR DOH 7,507.50 

TOTAL  ₱224,971.32 

 

90. The PhilHealth STUDIES (Strengthening the Thrust for Universal Health Care 
through Data, Information, and Knowledge Exchange Systems) is a research management 

collaboration between the PHIC and PCHRD that aims to provide funding for research 

projects focusing on the development of evidence-based policy recommendations on 

PhilHealth programs and services.  

 

91. While AHEAD (Advancing Health through Evidence-Assisted Decisions Program) 
is a DOH-funded program that aims to inform the health sector’s global and national 

administrative and legislative policy agenda, create an equitable and enabling environment 

for health policy and systems researchers all over the country, and ensure the progressive 

realization of the envisioned research system.  

 

92. The cost on the publication of the IRR is not among the allowable expenses to be 
charged to the AHEAD and PhilHealth STUDIES program funds pursuant to both MOA 

of said projects.. 
 

93. Management explained that the charging of these expenses to the AHEAD and 
PhilHealth STUDIES is provided in the activity proposal attached in the disbursement 

vouchers as follows: “the DOH and PHIC will benefit from it. Since the law facilitates easy 



54 
 

commercialization of health technologies generated from R&D, the DOH and PHIC will 

now have wider options/selection of technologies or products that they may endorse for 

use of the public.”  

  

94. However, we found this explanation untenable since the expenses incurred are not 
directly related/aligned with the intended projects and activities cited in the MOA of both 

programs. Likewise, the commercialization of technologies generated from R&D 

particularly for health is not specifically cited in the IRR. Therefore, the PCHRD, being 

mandated to focus on health-related R&D projects, is not the proper agency to fund the 

publication of this IRR. 
 

95. In view of the foregoing, the regularity of the aforementioned expenses is doubtful 
since the funds were disbursed without adhering to the provisions in the MOA, hence, will 

be disallowed in audit.  

 

96. We recommended and Management agreed to discontinue using the 
programs’ funds entrusted to the PCHRD for various activities that are not within or 

related to the programs’ approved projects and activities stated in the MOA; and 

henceforth, exercise judicious application of the provisions for each MOA entered 

into by the PCHRD.  

 

Management reply 

 

97. The amount of ₱224,971.32 for the publication of IRR of Republic Act No. 11337 
or the “Innovative Startup Act” in the Official Gazette and in the national dailies charged 

against the PhilHealth STUDIES and AHEAD program funds was based on the 

cooperation and collaboration created among the implementing agencies through the 

Philippine National Health Research System (PNHRS) Law or the Republic Act 10532. 

 

98. As the primary implementing institutions of the PNHRS, the DOST through the 
PCHRD and the DOH, together with the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, as one 

of the members of the Steering Committee, have the authority to allocate the funds of the 

PNHRS to ensure that all Filipinos are guaranteed equitable access to quality and 

affordable health care goods and services. 

 

99. One of the keys to ensure that PNHRS goals are achieved, the System (PNHRS) 
must create a nurturing legislative environment for startups, thus, support to RA 11337 or 

the Innovative Startup Act has been an opportunity. 
 

100. Over the years, the PNHRS understands that startups have been instrumental in 
various healthcare innovations in the country. For instance, the DOST-PCHRD together 

with the UPM-NIH have supported Manila HealthTek Inc., a startup company which paved 

the way for the dengue diagnostic test kit to be available to the public as well as the 

COVID-19 test kit used today to diagnose COVID-19. The company focused on 

developing and providing affordable diagnostic technologies for communicable and non-

communicable diseases.  
 



55 
 

101. Consequently, once an innovative entrepreneurial culture is thriving in the country, 
the Universal Health Care could be realized as more health-related technologies, devices, 

medicines, vaccines, procedures and all other health-related systems developed will 

become available and accessible to solve our health problems and improve quality of lives 

and health outcomes. 

 

102. In view thereof, Management assured that all our charges made to trust funds are 
within or related to the overall objectives and deliverables of the projects/programs 

entrusted to the PCHRD. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder 

 

103. Section 4.3 of PD 1445 provides that trust funds shall be available and may be spent 
only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds received.  Since 

PCHRD is only a trustee of the funds entrusted to them by the DOH and PhilHealth, these 

should be spent solely for the purpose that had been agreed upon as indicated in the MOA. 

Hence, we stand by our observation and recommendation. 

 

Non-disposal of Unserviceable Equipment 

 

104. The continuous non-disposal of unserviceable Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment amounting to ₱4.377 million 

contributed to the further deterioration and decrease in the saleable value of the said 

assets. 

 

105. Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that, “When the 
government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it 

shall, upon, application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the 

agency or his duly authorized representative xxx and if found to be valueless or unsaleable, 

it may be destroyed. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest 

bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body xxx. In the 

event that public auction fails. The property may be sold at a private sale at such prices as 

may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned xxx.” 

 

106. IPSAS 17 paragraph 82 states that “The carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant, and equipment shall be derecognized: (a) on disposal; or (b) when no future 

economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.” 
 

107. As at December 31, 2020, the unserviceable properties which remained in the 
PCHRD’s books of accounts amounted to ₱4,376,513.22 consisting of various defective 

ICT equipment. Due to the inattention of the Accounting Section, the carrying amounts of 

these assets were continuously carried in the books of accounts and reported in the 

Financial Statements (FS) as assets although these were already without use of service 

potential, which could possibly mislead the users/readers of the FS. Moreover, the 

deferment of the disposal of unserviceable properties has resulted in their further 

deterioration and reduction of saleable value. 

 



56 
 

108. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations that Management: 
 

a. require the Disposal Committee to expedite the appraisal and disposal of 
the unserviceable properties to avoid their further deterioration and 

accordingly, maximize the potential income that could be derived from 

their sale; and 

 

b. after the disposal, require the Accountant to prepare the necessary 
accounting entries to derecognize the said PPEs from the books of 

accounts. 

 

Deficiencies in the Honoraria payments 

 

109. The payment of honoraria amounting to ₱4.469 million for CY 2020 to the 
PCHRD personnel assigned in special projects was not supported with proper 

documentary requirements, and the computations of which were not within the 

updated applicable rules and regulations on the grant of honoraria. Moreover, 

honoraria payments to resource persons who are government personnel were not 

remitted to their respective government agencies for tax purposes and monitoring of 

the 25 percent annual basic salary threshold. 

 

110. The IRR on Magna Carta for Scientists, Engineers, Researchers, and other Science 
and Technology (S&T) personnel in government provides that “S&T personnel who 

rendered services beyond the established regular workload, whose broad and superior 

knowledge, expertise or professional standing in a specific field contributes to productivity 

and innovativeness shall be entitle to receive honorarium subject to rules set by the 

Department.” 

 

111. The source of funds for payment of honorarium shall be included in the 
appropriation of the funding agency.  

 

112. For CY 2020, records of the PCHRD revealed that honoraria amounting to 
P4,468,715.14 were paid to government personnel as resource persons to various S&T 

activities/projects.  

 

113. Review of honoraria transactions of the PCHRD revealed the following 
deficiencies: 

 

a) Honoraria payment lacking in supporting documents 
 

114. Under Section 5.7.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, those who 
are involved in science and technological activities who have rendered services beyond 

their regular workload are entitled to honoraria, provided that the payment is supported by 

the following documentary requirements: 
 

a. Office Order; 
b. Plan/Program of Activities; 



57 
 

c. Accomplishment Report/Certificate of completion of programmed activities; 
d. Authority to Collect Honoraria; and 
e. Certificate of acceptance by the Agency Head of the deliverables/project 

output. 

 

115. Moreover, Section 4.3.1 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No.1, Series of 2013 
requires that the personnel entitled to honoraria shall be paid based on productivity and 

quality of completed and accepted deliverables within the set timeframe. Hence, a special 

project plan shall be prepared, in consultation with all personnel concerned, subject to 

approval by the agency head. Such plan contains the following details: 

 
a. Outputs or deliverables per project component; 
b. Project timetable; 
c. Personnel assigned to the special project and their duties and responsibilities; 
d. Expected deliverables per personnel; and 
e. Estimated cost of monthly honoraria for each personnel based on work hours 

spent beyond the regular work hours. 

 

116. Review of honoraria payments totaling ₱4,468,715.14 for CY 2020 to PCHRD 
personnel assigned in special projects revealed that documentary requirements as 

prescribed in Section 5.7.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 4.3.1 of DBM-

DOST JC No.1 s. 2013 had not been complied with due to the negligence of the Accounting 

Section in requiring personnel involved to submit the requirements.  
 

117. The documents attached to support the said payments in the disbursement vouchers 
are Special Orders issued by the Agency Head which provides the authority to collect 

Honoraria, Accomplishment Reports prepared by the assigned personnel and certification 

from the Division Head (instead of the Agency Head) that the personnel had rendered 

services based on the submitted Accomplishment Report. Further evaluation showed that 

accomplishment reports submitted were activities performed without indicating the 

expected outputs/project deliverables as may be stated in the special project plan. 
 

118. The documentary requirements prescribed in the above COA Circular are 
consistent with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST JC No. 1, s. 2013.  These documents 

help the Audit Team validate the correct computation of honoraria rates considering the 

details such as expected deliverables per personnel assigned to the project per project 

component at specified timeframes; cost by project component, including the estimated 

cost for honoraria for each personnel based on man-hours to be spent in the project beyond 

the regular work hours; and the rating of performance of the personnel assigned. 
 

119. Based on the foregoing, i.e., the non-compliance with the requirements prescribed 
under Section 5.7.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 as well as the guidelines set under 

DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013, the Audit Team could not validate the 

claims/payment of honoraria to personnel assigned in special projects and may result to the 

issuance of a Notice of Suspension (NS). 
 

 



58 
 

120. We recommended and Management agreed to submit the documentary 
requirements pertaining to the payment of  P4,468,715.14 honoraria,  and henceforth, 

strictly comply with the submission of the documentary requirements prescribed in 

Section 5.7.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 4.3.1 of DBM-DOST JC No. 

1 series of 2013 on payment of honoraria to personnel assigned in special projects. 

 

b) Honoraria computations not accordance with DBM-DOST Joint Circular  
 

121. DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 prescribed the Rules and Regulations on 
the Grant of Compensation-Related Magna Carta Benefits to Scientist, Engineers, 

Researchers and Other Science and Technology (S&T) Personnel.  The Circular provided 

the computation of honoraria for personnel assigned to special projects, as follows: 
 

“Section 4.3 As token payment for services rendered beyond the regular duties 

and responsibilities of their positions, Honoraria for Assignment in Special 

Projects may be granted. 

 

4.3.1  The total Honoraria per personnel for a month shall be based on 

productivity and quality of completed and accepted deliverables for 

the set timeframe.  Hence, a special project plan shall be prepared, 

in consultation with all personnel concerned, subject to approval 

by the agency head.  Such plan shall contain the following details: 

 

4.3.1.1  Outputs or deliverables per project component; 

4.3.1.2  Project timetable 

4.3.1.3 Personnel assigned to the special project and their duties 

and      responsibilities 

4.3.1.4  Expected deliverables per personnel; and 

4.3.1.5 Estimated cost of monthly honoraria for each personnel 

based on work hours spent beyond the regular work hours, 

computed as follows: 

 

Estimated Honoraria, H =  
Salary 1 Month 1 Day 

T Hours 
Month 22 Days 8 Hours 

 
Where: 

           Salary – Step 1 of the Salary Grade of the designated position 
           T         = estimated numbers of work hours spent in the special project 

 

4.3.2   The total Honoraria that may be paid from government funds for all 

special projects shall not exceed 25% of the employee’s annual 

basic salary pursuant to Section 44(e) of R.A. No. 10352 and as 

may be reiterated in subsequent GAAs.” 

 

122. Moreover, DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007, also provides 
the Guidelines on the Grant of Honoraria Due to Assignment in Government Special 

Projects such that:  



59 
 

Section 4.5 thereof states that “payment of the honorarium shall be made only 

upon completion and acceptance by the agency head of the deliverable per 

project component.” 

  

“Section 4.6 The actual honorarium to be paid to each personnel shall depend 

on the performance rating to be given by the project management, as follows: 

  

Performance Rating 
% of Estimated Honoraria per project 

Component 

Outstanding 100% 

Very Satisfactory 85% 

Satisfactory 70% 

 

For example, if the performance rating is Very Satisfactory, the actual 

honorarium to be paid follows:  
 

Actual Honorarium = 85% (H) 
 

 Section 4.7  For rating purposes, the project management shall formulate a 

performance evaluation plan that is transparent and fair, and considers 

timeliness, quality of outputs, and other applicable work efficiency 

determinants.” 

 

123. As at December 31, 2020, payment of honoraria to science and technology 
personnel who were assigned to special projects and rendered services beyond the regular 

duties and responsibilities of their positions or beyond the regular work hours amounted to 

₱4,468,715.14. 
 

124. Evaluation of the documents disclosed that computations of honoraria given to 
personnel assigned to special projects were not in accordance with DBM-DOST Joint 

Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 which are the specific 

guidelines issued on the grant of honoraria due to assignment in government special 

projects as cited above, but instead adhered to the policy of DOST MC No. 001 s. 2009 

amending DOST MC No. 001 s. 2003, also known  as “Revised Implementing Guidelines 

on the grant of Honoraria to personnel whose services are engaged by the National Science 

and Technology System.” 
 

125. Based on DOST MC No. 001 s. 2009, honoraria were fixed at a specific rate per 
month depending on the assigned responsibility of the personnel. For instance, on the 

payment of honoraria with JEV-2020-06-001292 dated June 30, 2020, one (1) personnel 

was assigned as a project/program staff, with honoraria rate of ₱4,800.00 per month, thus, 

for the period of three months the total payment amounted to ₱14,400.00.  

 

126. The implementation of the said Memorandum Circular clearly deviates from the 
guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular 

No. 2007-2 as it failed to consider the productivity and quality of completed and accepted 

deliverables for the set timeframe.   
 



60 
 

127. Further, project management failed to formulate performance evaluation plan for 
rating purposes that considers transparency and fairness, timeliness, quality of outputs, and 

other applicable work efficiency determinants. These performance rating will be used in 

the payment of actual honorarium as prescribed in DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2. 
 

128. In line with the foregoing, the payments of honoraria to personnel assigned to 
special projects which are not in accordance with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST 

Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 are deemed to be 

irregular and disadvantageous to government spending and will be disallowed in audit. 

 

129. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Submit justifications on the use of DOST MC No. 001 s. 2009 in the 
computation of the honoraria paid to project personnel; 

 

b. Require the Accountant to: 
 

i. re-compute the honoraria paid for CY 2020 based on DBM-DOST 
Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 

for our further evaluation; and 

 

ii. henceforth, strictly comply with the guidelines set under DBM-
DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 

2007-2 on the computation of honorarium payment to personnel 

assigned in special projects; 

 

c. Adequately plan the implementation of the project by preparing special 
project plan considering the details enumerated in Section 4.3.1.1 to 

Section 4.3.1.5 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013; and 

 

d. Formulate performance evaluation plan for rating purposes which will be 
used in the payment of actual honorarium. 

 

Management Comment 

 

130. Management commented that the DOST MC No. 001, s. 2009 was issued by the 
DOST pursuant to its authority as an overall overseer of the DOST system. The MC has 

been consistently used by the PCHRD in granting honoraria to special project personnel 

and it’s the same rates used by other agencies of the DOST system.  They also claimed that 

the MC provides a simplified rate computation and at times proves to be more cost efficient 

to the government as it fixed the honoraria rates depending on the task and position of the 

assigned personnel. 

 

131. Management further commented that comparison of the rates of honorarium 
between the DBM-DOST JC and the DOST MC showed that the rates of honorarium 

computed under the DBM-DOST JC is higher than the DOST MC.  Therefore, the payment 

of honorarium does not constitute an irregular government spending as the amount actually 



61 
 

paid was lower than what should be received by the project staff.  Moreover, on the Annual 

Work Plan for the project, this is a basic requirement before the payment of honorarium. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder 
 

132. We maintain our stand that the computation be based on the provisions of DBM-
DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 

2007-2 dated October 1, 2007; otherwise, payment of honoraria based on DOST MC No. 

001, s. 2009 computations shall be disallowed in audit.  

 

c)  Release of Honoraria payments not in accordance with applicable rulings 
 

133. Section 23 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, or the Tax 
Reform Act of 1997 states that “A citizen of the Philippines residing therein is taxable on 

all income derived from sources within and without the Philippines.” 
 

134. Further, Section 272 of the same Act on  Violation of Withholding Tax Provision, 
states that “Every officer or employee of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines 

or any of its agencies and instrumentalities, its political subdivisions, as well as 

government-owned or-controlled corporations, including the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 

(BSP), who, under the provisions of this Code or rules and regulations promulgated 

thereunder, is charged with the duty to deduct and withhold any internal revenue tax and 

to remit the same in accordance with the provisions of this Code and other laws is guilty 

of any offense herein below specified shall, upon conviction for each act or omission be 

punished by a fine of not less than Five thousand pesos (P5,000) but not more than Fifty 

thousand pesos (P50,000) or suffer imprisonment of not less than six (6) months and one 

(1) day but not more than two (2) years, or both: 

 

a. Failing or causing the failure to deduct and withhold any internal revenue tax 
under any of the withholding tax laws and implementing rules and 

regulations; 

b. Failing or causing the failure to remit taxes deducted and withheld within the 
time prescribed by law, and implementing rules and regulations; and 

c. Failing or causing the failure to file return or statement within the time 
prescribed, or rendering or furnishing a false or fraudulent return or 

statement required under the withholding tax laws and rules and 

regulations.” 

 

135. Section 4.3.2 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013 
likewise stipulates that the total honoraria that may be paid from government funds for all 

special projects shall not exceed 25% of the employee’s annual basic salary and also 

pursuant to Section 44(e) of R.A. No. 10352 and as also reiterated in Section 53 of the 

GAA for FY 2020. 

 

136. Government personnel who act as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators or 
facilitators in other government agencies which are outside of their mother agencies, may 

be paid honoraria at such rates as may be determined by the agency authorities concerned.  



62 
 

Further, science and technology personnel who render services beyond the established 

workload of scientists, technologists, researchers and technicians whose broad and superior 

knowledge, expertise or professional standing in a specific field contributes to productivity 

and innovativeness shall be entitled to receive honoraria in accordance with the guidelines 

prescribed in DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 

2007-1 & 2.  

 

137. Records disclosed, however, that honoraria were paid directly to the said 
government personnel and not to their respective mother agencies.  Honoraria directly paid 

to government personnel may not be reported to their mother agency, making it difficult 

for the latter to properly account and monitor the amount of honoraria received for taxation 

and 25 percent threshold purposes. 
 

138. Although, verification showed that payments of honoraria were constantly 
deducted a ten (10) percent withholding tax by the PCHRD, honoraria received by 

government personnel are considered additional income in which for taxation purposes 

should be included/declared in the government personnel’s individual income tax returns.  

Consequently, any taxes withheld by the paying agency should be supported by 

certifications which serve as a proof that applicable taxes had been deducted/withheld. 

  

139. We recommended that Management require the Accountant to remit the 
honoraria payments to the respective mother agencies of government personnel and 

to issue the corresponding certificates on the taxes withheld.  

 

Management Comment  
 

140. Management commented that the payment of honoraria of government resource 
persons to their mother agency will have an adverse effect in the implementation of the 

PCHRD projects. The payment scheme would also in effect discriminate government 

resource persons as against the private sector counterpart who will not be subjected to the 

same rigorous procedure. In effect it will not only deprive them of additional income, but 

it could also entail loss of talent to the government.  

 

141. Management further commented that the remittance to the mother agency will 
surely discourage government resource persons to lend their expertise to the PCHRD as 

there will be delays in the payment of their honoraria.  
 

142. In addition, Management claimed that  RA 11312, prohibits the limit on honoraria 
received by S&T personnel sourced from externally funded grants. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

143. We maintain our stand that the payment of honoraria be remitted to the respective 
mother agencies of government personnel and to issue the corresponding certificates on 

the taxes withheld, in compliance with the provisions of Section 53 of the General 

Provisions of RA 11465 (GAA for FY 2020) which stipulates the 25 percent threshold on 

honoraria for officials and employees assigned to special projects. 



63 
 

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

144. The PCHRD implemented and mainstreamed activities embodied in the GAD 
Plan which addressed gender issues and concerns with actual expenditures of ₱50.008 

million or 8.40% percent of its appropriation of ₱595.114 million, in compliance with 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA. 

 

145. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA and Section 36 of RA 
9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, both state that the agency’s Gender and Development 

(GAD) budget shall be at least five percent (5%) of its total budget appropriation. 
 

146. Section 36 (b), Chapter VI, of RA 9710 also provides that all departments, 
including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, 

government-owned and -controlled corporations, local government units, and other 

government instrumentalities shall establish or strengthen their GAD Focal Point System 

(GFPS) or similar GAD mechanism to catalyze and accelerate gender mainstreaming 

within the agency or local government unit. The GFPS shall be composed of the agency 

head or local chief executive, an executive committee with an Undersecretary (or its 

equivalent), local government unit official, or office in a strategic decision-making position 

as Chair; and a technical working group or secretariat which is composed of representatives 

from various divisions or offices within the agency or local government unit. The tasks and 

functions of the members of the GFP shall form part of their regular key result areas and 

shall be given due consideration in their performance evaluation. 
 

147. Section 4 of Philippine Commission on Women-National Economic Development 
Authority - Department of Budget and Management Joint Circular (PCW-NEDA-DBM JC 

No. 2012-01)  states that the agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database GAD 

information to include gender statistics and sex disaggregated data that have been 

systematically produced or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, 

programming and policy information.
