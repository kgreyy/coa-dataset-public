EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) 

was created on March 17, 1982 through Executive Order No. 128 and is mandated 

to formulate policies, plans, programs, projects, and strategies for health science 

and technology (S&T) development program; allocate government and external 

funds for research and development (R&D); monitor R&D projects; and generate 

external funds. 

 

The policy-making body of the Council is vested upon the Governing 

Council (GC) with the DOST Secretary as Chairman and the Secretary of the 

Department of Health (DOH) as Co-Chairman. Members of the GC are the 

Chancellor of UP Manila, the Executive Directors of the National Nutrition Council 

(NNC), and PCHRD and four from the private sector.  

 

The Council is headed by an Executive Director, Dr. Jaime C. Montoya, and 

four Division Chiefs, who undertake the agency’s policy thrusts and programs, 

namely: 1. Research and Development Management Division (RDMD), with nine 

members, 2. Institution Development Division (IDD), with nine members,                    

3. Research Information, Communication, and Utilization Division (RICUD), with 

14 members, and, 4. Finance and Administrative Division (FAD), with 15 

members.  

 

Thus, the total manpower of PCHRD consists of 55 regular employees,

C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial and compliance audits of the accounts and 

operations of the PCHRD for the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was 

conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s 

assertions on the financial statements, (b) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities, (c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of 

compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations, and (d) determine the extent of 

implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements as at December 31, 

2020 due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total misstatements 

of ₱16.587 million and ₱21.056 million which represent 0.84 percent and 1.88 percent of 

its total assets and equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies of P410.603 million or 

48.59 percent of its total liabilities. 

 

E. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
  

The other significant observations and recommendations, discussed in detail in 

Part II of the report are as follows: 

 

1. Management’s insufficient project monitoring, leniency in requiring liquidation of 
FTs/refund of unexpended balances, and non-provision of sanctions to IAs/Project 

Leaders for non-submission of reports/non-liquidation of FTs for completed research 

projects resulted in the increase of unliquidated FTs recorded under Due from NGAs, Due 

from NGOs/POs, and Other Receivables, by 102 percent from last year’s 

₱621,577,156.38 to ₱1,257,232,034.81 as at year-end. 



iii 

 

We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations and Management agreed 

to: 

 

a) require the responsible Project Officers/Division Chiefs to identify and 
closely/regularly monitor the programs/projects which were the subject 

of FTs/grants and strictly enforce the provisions of DOST AO No. 11, s. 

2020, on the reporting requirements and liquidation of the grants;  

 

b) exhaust all possible remedies to compel the IAs to liquidate their long 
outstanding balances and return the excess funds therefrom;  

 

c) require the concerned Technical Divisions to send demand letters to 
IAs/Project Leaders with long outstanding balances, stating definite 

deadlines for submission of the required reports and the possible legal 

actions that may be instigated against them in case of non-compliance; 

  

d) stop releasing funds to IAs with unliquidated FTs, specifically those with 
completed projects, and/or initiate legal measures against Project 

Leaders with unsettled completed projects;  

 

e) if concerned NGOs/POs continuously fail to liquidate the funds entrusted 
them, institute legal action against them for violating Section 5.4 of COA 

Circular No. 2007-001; and 

  

f) henceforth, require the Accounting and Technical Divisions to 
coordinate/collaborate with each other, specifically on the submission of 

documents and the refund of the excess amount of the completed projects 

of the IAs. 
 

2. DOST Administrative Order (AO) No. 009 s. 2017 dated November 9, 2017 was 
not faithfully followed on account of the following: (a) disbursement of project funds for 

CY 2020 and beyond after the duration of the projects, contrary to Sections VIII.3 and 

3.d.iv; and (b) amount allotted for Indirect Expenses of ₱10.578 million in place of 

₱0.300 million maximum allowable indirect cost, in violation of Section VII b.ii. 
 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a) submit written justifications on the continuous disbursement of project 
funds despite the expiration of the MOA and a no cost-extension, and/or 

amendments mutually agreed by both parties for our evaluation, before 

an action in audit may be undertaken. 

 

b) submit to the Audit Team the amended MOA, particularly on the project 
extensions beyond the one-year period, if any, including the amendments 

to LIB agreed by both parties; and henceforth, strictly comply with the 

provisions set under DOST Administrative Order No. 009 s. of 2017 

dated November 9, 2017, in allotting indirect expenses. 



iv 

 

 

3. The publication of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic 
Act No. 11337 or the “Innovative Startup Act” in the Official Gazette and in the national 

dailies, amounting to ₱0.223 million, charged against the PhilHealth STUDIES and 

AHEAD programs’ funds, contravened the intended undertakings stated in the MOA of 

the said programs, hence, deemed irregular under Section 3.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-

003. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to discontinue using the 

programs’ funds entrusted to the PCHRD for various activities that are not within 

or related to the programs’ approved projects and activities stated in the MOA; and 

henceforth, exercise judicious application of the provisions for each MOA entered 

into by the PCHRD.  

 

4. The payment of honoraria amounting to ₱4.469 million for CY 2020 to the 
PCHRD personnel assigned in special projects was not supported with proper 

documentary requirements, and the computations of which were not within the updated 

applicable rules and regulations on the grant of honoraria. Moreover, honoraria payments 

to resource persons who are government personnel were not remitted to their respective 

government agencies for tax purposes and monitoring of the 25 percent annual basic 

salary threshold. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to submit the documentary 

requirements pertaining to the payment of P4,468,715.14 honoraria, and henceforth, 

strictly comply with the submission of the documentary requirements prescribed in 

Section 5.7.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 4.3.1 of DBM-DOST JC 

No. 1 series of 2013 on payment of honoraria to personnel assigned in special 

projects. 

 

We also recommended that Management: 

 

a) Submit justifications on the use of DOST MC No. 001 s. 2009 in the 
computation of the honoraria paid to project personnel; 

 

b) Require the Accountant to: 
 

i. re-compute the honoraria paid for CY 2020 based on DBM-DOST 
Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 

for our further evaluation; and 

 

ii. henceforth, strictly comply with the guidelines set under DBM-
DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 

2007-2 on the computation of honorarium payment to personnel 

assigned in special projects; 

 



v 

 

c) Adequately plan the implementation of the project by preparing special 
project plan considering the details enumerated in Section 4.3.1.1 to 

Section 4.3.1.5 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013; and 

 

d) Formulate performance evaluation plan for rating purposes which will be 
used in the payment of actual honorarium. 

 

Likewise, we recommended that Management require the Accountant to 

remit the honoraria payments to the respective mother agencies of government 

personnel and to issue the corresponding certificates on the taxes withheld.  

 

The above observations and recommendations were discussed with the concerned 

officials of the agency through the Summary of Audit Observations and 

Recommendations (SAOR), transmitted on May 10, 2021, in lieu of exit conference. 

Management’s views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.
